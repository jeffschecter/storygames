Which corresponds with Super Hero games not filling up at our events. I have no idea why this is.

Were respondents only allowed to choose one game they wanted to play more of? Was there a fill-in-the-blank spot, or did you provide all of the names of the games? What additional questions did you ask?</blockquote>\nGood questions!<br/><br/>Attendees were asked what games they would like to play and see at a future Recess. No examples or choices were given. It was simply fill in the blank. And no other games were listed on the survey as part of any other question that could bias them (as far as I can superficially tell). <br/><br/>We also asked if there were games that they wanted to play at Recess but were filled up. As well as questions about where did they hear about the event, types of games they enjoy, what they enjoyed most about Recess, what they enjoyed least, what games they played, what they liked/disliked about their GM/Game Organizer, would they come to Recess again and if not, why. <br/><br/>I'm not in charge of the surveys themselves but one thing I plan to offer as a change is replacing "what did you dislike" with a more general "how can we improve Recess next time" question. We observed a lot of people thinking hard to find something they disliked just to completely fill out the survey. We got a lot of "I disliked that I didn't win True Nerd Trivia" and "I dislike stairs" (even though there were elevators) usually followed by comments like "but we don't expect you to do anything about this, it's just what we disliked." We also received amazingly useful information from this question that I don't want to lose. <br/><br/>One thing that occurs to me is that these results do not reflect what people play, just what they want to play (and not instead of what they currently play but in addition to). Many of these attendees could be in ongoing D&amp;D and Burning Wheel games and simply want something different (or in addition) at our events or in the future.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_356945">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker" title="Jim_Crocker"><img alt="Jim_Crocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/nEX8WSQ3H0VUJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker">Jim_Crocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356945/#Comment_356945" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-31T09:51:40+00:00" title="January 31, 2012  9:51AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 31, 2012 10:00AM by Jim_Crocker.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John, et al-<br/><br/>To be fair, there's also a certain amount of celebrity bias in those results. I suspect that you or Eppy or Terry or Jim B could run, like, World of Synnibar and it'd fill right up. Like, you said that 'superhero' games don't see to do well, but your X-Men game filled right up, and I saw one player when asked his choice, said YOUR name, not the name of the game! : )<br/><br/>I think that's mostly great, in that it creates a culture where you and those other popular GMs are trusted and can then run new or unfamiliar systems and get good buy-in, as well as being a source of best practices for people who play in those games. It does create data gathering hiccups, though, in that if it wasn't you running that X-Men game, would it have filled up right away? Certainly the other Psi*Run game that ran did not fill up until after players whose games hadn't run joined in, for example.<br/><br/>Ideally, after a few years of running the show, there will be a large enough cadre of recognized GMs that the effect will flatten out; it's been very interesting to be her to watch the con starting to break through from being a gathering of friends to a real going concern, a tough challenge you guys seem to be handling really well.<br/><br/>(And I wonder if it might not be instructive to try to break the choices down into categories? Like if people named 5 different OSR clones, does that count as 5 people making essentially the same choice?)<br/><br/>Anyway, it was a really fun con, and the heavy emphasis on a wide range of game options is a real strong suit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_356947">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker" title="Jim_Crocker"><img alt="Jim_Crocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/nEX8WSQ3H0VUJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker">Jim_Crocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356947/#Comment_356947" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-31T09:58:42+00:00" title="January 31, 2012  9:58AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I also wonder if maybe some more focused questions:have you payed this game before?

They have no Rabbi and no Torah, and the High Holy Days are almost upon them. Their only hope lies with the Three Wise Mensch of Crown Heights. These mystics, steeped in the arts of Kabbalah and Jewjitsu, must battle their way to the very topmost tip of Manhattan. But no cars, and no subways! It\u2019s the Shabbos, after all.</blockquote>\nWe also had multiple My Little Pony Games, multiple Harry Potter games, Sesame Street, Maids, Dolphins, Fraggle Rock, Muppets, and Slaves. <br/><br/>And of course the normal zombies, wizards, fantasy adventurers, super heroes, space marines, vampires, super spies, ninjas, martial artists, Cthulhu, and amazing board games.<br/><br/>But no Spartans.<br/><br/>If you don't count me or my mom.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_356987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356987/#Comment_356987" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-31T11:30:11+00:00" title="January 31, 2012 11:30AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: mease19</cite>Maybe you could offer a discount coupon for registration (if its a precon questionnaire) or a drawing (if it's a post con questionnaire) for people who return a longer questionnaire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jim Crocker</cite>I also wonder if maybe some more focused questions:have you payed this game before?
