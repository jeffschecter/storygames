What's more, as we were noodling playsets and alternative settings after the game, one of the players, Chirag Asnani, came up with a playset idea there and then and e-mailed it to me a couple of days later. It's called *Fallout Shelter*, and I've now added it to the doc (see below for link).<br/><br/>Ok, the playtest. First, I have to confess to something that seems depressingly common among designers, to whit forgetting one's own rules. It happened during several playtests of my first game, Sci-Fi Beta Kappa, including one game where one of the players put on their feedback sheet that Mechanic X should have Effect A instead of Effect B, and Mechanic Y should have Effect B instead of A. I thanked the guy for his comments, went back to the draft, and... found that what he'd suggested was actually how I'd  written it. <i>D'oh!</i> In the playtest of SkipJack, I'd said that first the objects should be chosen, and then going the opposite way round the players should then add the valences, i.e. they would add assign valences to objects that <i>other</i> players had chosen. I don't know why the hell I said that, it was confusing for the players and in fact wasn't how I had it in the rules. But no big. <br/><br/>The procedure is as follows: the player group goes round 2-3 times choosing from a limited list of everyday objects, assigns each of them a value, and then starts the game. In the first part, each player in turn chooses one of the objects, notes its valence (+, - or +/-), suggests a period of the Protagonist\u2019s life, and imagines a scene where the chosen object would play a pivotal role or be the focus of the action. Then the group decides who, in addition to the Protagonist, would be in the scene, what the relationship to the Protagonist would be, assigns roles to players and acts out the scene. It really is that simple. Thereafter, more objects are chosen and scenes imagined and played out, perhaps with the same NPCs as previously, sometimes with completely different ones or a mixture thereof. (The active player always plays the Protagonist). At the end of every scene the active player notes down what they learned about the Protagonist from that scene, whether that be one word personality descriptors, or ambitions, hopes or relationships with key NPCs etc. <br/><br/>We ended up with a character called Thomas, who we first met after a rugby match in which he was named Man of the Match, the object being a rugby ball. The rugby ball\u2019s valence was +/-, so we decided it should be positive because Thomas had been named Man of the Match, but also negative because he\u2019d received a serious injury during the match which put paid to his hopes of turning professional, the second scene being in the hospital, with the Doctor saying it was unlikely he\u2019d ever be able to play again. Thereafter he ended up in a dead end job, had a brief relationship with a waitress called (I think) Sophie, and later on married someone called Diane, who cheated on him with one of his friends from his rugby days, who he\u2019d also set up a business with (another object chosen was a set of cheque stubs, which we\u2019d decided were from cheques spent on setting up the business). The last scene had as its focus a sofa, still in shrink (when choosing objects the players have the option to decide on a condition - used, new, slightly worn or torn etc.), which the player taking on the role of Protagonist at that point imagined had been bought for the couple\u2019s new home. The final scene was quite climactic as Thomas stormed into the office of his best friend and confronted him over the betrayal. <br/><br/>So we managed to get a pretty good session out of it, although we had only an hour to play with, as it was part of a playtest event where several games were scheduled and played. If we\u2019d had more time, after a sort of wash-up period (Reflection), where we\u2019d have discussed what had happened in the first part, and what kind of protagonist had emerged, in the second part we\u2019d have started jumping about in time a lot more, revisiting some of the earlier scenes and exploring those periods of the Protagonist\u2019s life in a bit more detail, we\u2019d have gone back to the objects and changed the valences of some of them, then we\u2019d have done the closing scene (Closure) - although we actually did manage to squeeze that in (see the scene above involving the sofa) - and finally we\u2019d have done the Epilogue, where the player group looks at then Protagonist\u2019s life a few months or years further on.    <br/><br/>What did we learn about the game? That the rules are straightforward, and very easy to pick up. That the game works, and that a lot of mileage can be got from surprisingly little input. Other comments included the point that having constraints (in the form of the objects and their valences) is a good thing as it encourages player creativity and ingenuity, that there should be a few more objects (done), that the process of choosing the objects and valences should be more speedy (done), and that the tone should be set at the beginning of the game, so that it doesn\u2019t run the risk of straying into dark or gonzo  territory unconsensually (also done \u2013 see the new <b>Stage 0: Setting the tone</b> section in the latest draft). Also, one player noted that the group should write down all the names of the NPCs in case they forget them later (we found that Significant NPCs recurred a lot).  <br/><br/>If any of the other players wish to comment, feel free to so do, and stand by for some playsets and alternative settings, starting with Chirag\u2019s Zombie-themed <b>Fallout Shelter</b>.<br/><br/>Link to current doc <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/44973653/SkipJack.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a>.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445844">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445844/#Comment_445844" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-29T13:56:10+00:00" title="June 29, 2015  1:56PM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 29, 2015 1:56PM by catty_big.">edited June 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just wondering if anyone's interested in playtesting this?                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
