Which is a pretty neat place, with tables and chairs and whatnot. There's a coffee bar in there too. It's right near the train station and there's a fair bit of parking around, although not free.  You can find more about the venue <a href="http://www.bordersstores.com/stores/store_pg.jsp?storeID=158" rel="nofollow">here.</a><br/><br/>The event is all day, with the door opening at 9am and the shop closing at 11pm. I'm trying to formalise the schedule, but it looks like a two slot thing with games starting at 10am and 3pm.<br/><br/>There will apparently be a fair few boardgamers there too.<br/><br/>I am planning on running Agon (with Lego, obviously :^) in the morning and probably another game in the afternoon, although I'm not yet sure quite what.<br/><br/>Come along, it'll be fun!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81409">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick" title="Andrew Kenrick"><img alt="Andrew Kenrick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/145/415482171_321214bd7c.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick">Andrew Kenrick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81409/#Comment_81409" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-16T06:55:30+00:00" title="July 16, 2007  6:55AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Woah, that sounds dangerously like you're gaming in ... public!

Is it intended purely for gamers, or do you think you'll take advantage of its location to attract newcomers/curious folks?

My logic being that:<br/><br/>1) I can't see any way to contact likely newbies.  I mean, telling you lot is easy: I come here, post and then you all know.  Where the heck are likely newbies going to find out about this?  We're putting a notice up in the local Forbidden Planet, but beyond that I can't really think of anywhere (other than the bookshop itself).  Maybe the Games Workshop cr\xc3\xa8che, but I don't know if they'd let us put notices up in their shop for anything other than WFRP (which, needless to say since you know how I feel about it, I won't be running)<br/><br/>2) Which brings me to my next point: I hate children.  I figure the vast majority of people who're going to get into gaming do so in one of three points in their life, A) at School, <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> at University or C) later in life when one or more of their mates talks them into it.  I really don't see that many in group <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> not just joining the university club.  I'd rather stab myself with forks than have to deal with group A) (Which is why I'd have organised the whole thing in a pub if I'd been in charge organising of venue :^)  Which leaves group C), but how exactly do you reach them?<br/><br/>I mean, my ideal attendee is someone who's a lapsed gamer looking to get back into it after a while of inactivity.  In fact, that's exactly who the whole thing's aimed at.  the only dedicated games shop in Southampton died about 9 months ago and we're trying to hook back into the community they had and get some of the small groups that went off to do their own thing to talk to each other again.<br/><br/>So really, that just leaves people wandering past in the shop.  Which is cool and all, but this is really an event for play rather than for demoing.  So the games are running, someone walks by and thinks "that looks interesting" and chances are that the game is in full swing and they can't really be fitted in.  So really I'd have to decide if this is an event for recruiting new gamers or just for play, and TBH I think an event for play is more likely to succeed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81436">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81436/#Comment_81436" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-16T08:38:39+00:00" title="July 16, 2007  8:38AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rich Stokes</cite>I can't see any way to contact likely newbies.</blockquote>\nHow about coordinating with Borders?  They probably have an event coordinator person.  They also probably have a bulletin board.

If you want to get passing punters, you need to have something large and colourful that stands up and can be seen from a distance.  It may be old-school, but having a set of painted figures and a diorama to put them in provides a bit of eye-candy too.  Do you know any wargamer-types who could lend you some stuff?  That'll get a few second glances.  <br/><br/>Once you get a game going, you can use the excitement and activity to draw in a few more people.  If you're interested in dragging in passing trade, the 15 minute demos are the way to go.  <br/><br/>Of course, if you've already got a bunch of people coming who want to play other games, this is all moot.  <br/><br/>Neil.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick" title="Andrew Kenrick"><img alt="Andrew Kenrick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/145/415482171_321214bd7c.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick">Andrew Kenrick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81595/#Comment_81595" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-17T04:48:38+00:00" title="July 17, 2007  4:48AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I bet Rich's lego will do the trick.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
