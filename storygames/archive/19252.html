It sounds fun! There are tons of good resources online to help GMs create hex-based sandbox worlds, lots of them aimed at a minimum of preparation designed to give the GM lots of evocative starting points to improvise from in play. <a href="http://hexcrawl.net/2013/06/hex-basics-part-i/" rel="nofollow">Here's one</a> I liked, in case anyone is interested.<br/><br/>But there seems to be much less about actually running a hexcrawl once you are playing. This is classic RPG textism - the actual in-play procedures are almost all implicit and passed around by playing with other people. I can make guesses at what other people's play looks like, but it will probably just end up with me porting my own assumptions from other games. So, I appeal to Story Games: First, do you know of any existing texts that would teach me how to referee a hexcrawl? And secondly, if not, how about you tell me something off the top of your head?<br/><br/>Some specific things that I'm interested in that don't seem to be mentioned in the texts I've read:\n<ol>\n<li>Is the hex map a "GM secret" - like a dungeon map might be? Do the players then map as they go along? Or is the whole world, with all its labelled towns and dungeons, revealed at the start?</li>\n<li>I was thinking of including published modules as scattered adventure locations in my hex map, and letting the PCs pick up rumours from the few days travel away. But a lot of modules assume specific terrain types, and a 6 mile hex isn't a large area. Even with tens or hundreds, I wouldn't expect to see much climate variation, realistically. Do people just hand wave this and have much faster changes in climate ("Oh look, the desert next to the farming area")? Do you have extremely long journeys through hundreds of hexes? Do you restrict yourself to one or two climates? Do you have long "non-hex" journeys been fully mapped out areas?</li>\n</ol>\nBut a general overview of procedure would be good.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428878">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428878/#Comment_428878" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-27T06:05:25+00:00" title="February 27, 2014  6:05AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1) When I've done this, the hex map was "secret" even from the GM.

It never got supported though.<br/><br/>Quick answers to your questions, then I'll add a few thoughts of my own.<br/><br/>1) Your choice. Many GMs will reveal a very rough map to players, essentially a sketch map. Detailed hex maps are secret until the players map them. This may be exhaustive (especially if they are trying to settle/conquer a megahex) or much more cursory (noting ruins, basic rivers, etc, which is often more playable). True wilderness areas are very unlikely to be already mapped in a medieval setting.<br/>2) Yes, many people do that with their modules. Also remember that even a six-mile hex does not have uniform terrain throughout, with a few exceptions. You may well encounter a smallish swamp inside a forest, for example, or a hundred acre wood on a plain. Use common sense; this may even be a story trigger. For climate...well, the base rule is that a degree of latitude (north or south) is equal to about 70 miles. Philadelphia is at 40 degrees lat in the US. Therefore, weather reports for it can be used as a hand-wavy extrapolation. Places like London are warmer than they should be because they're on a warm ocean current; you can thus make some fudges as necessary in your cities. Unless a player is a meteorologist, they will have no idea. Use other cities for other climates, using distance from Philly to identify the cities. The real system is the optional weather system published in Wilderness Adventures (1st AD &amp; D), which I recommend highly. Lots of rolls, but if you do a page or two of them beforehand, it makes an awesome difference.<br/><br/>The best game I was ever in involved hexcrawling through Greyhawk as we played 2e's <i>Fate of Istus</i>, which took place all over the world. So there would be a long journey to the next step, etc. This game was totally awesome...and I suspect in hindsight it made <i>Fate</i> a lot more awesome than it actually is.<br/><br/>Our GM typically handled long journeys as follows. He'd prepare a rough route beforehand, noting what latitudes we'd pass through, and then occasionally design a few set-piece encounters before hand. He'd drop these in to his taste or according to a random die roll. He'd also work up a few sets of random encounters to have ready to hand and use them when the die said so. We generally made about thirty miles (one hex) a day, and might expect none, one, two, three, or even occasionally more encounters based on the terrain factors. (Damn you Suss Forest!) Don't forget the joys of night encounters too <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Or that loooots of things like to eat horses...<br/><br/>We generally didn't pause much on our travels, and so probably marched past all kinds of notional dungeons and lairs. But it was OK. Had we been exploring, he'd have had to do a lot more detail work, but remember, our pace would have been much slower, perhaps balancing things a bit. (Getting through a hex is much faster than poking around in it looking for trouble.)  Nowadays you can do all this with random generators and a bit of tinkering, so I really don't think it'd be a big deal.<br/><br/>One thing that makes the hexcrawl come alive is narrative immersion. Periodically drop in a sentence or two about the setting. "You emerge from the trees to see a small sunken meadow. A sudden shaft of light through the clouds bathes the place in a sickly bronze glow. It may rain soon." Do this fairly often so PCs don't expect a monster to jump them every time you open your mouth. Also drop in dressing...a massive worn stone head lying on its side by the trail; a cracked fountain built around a spring; a tiny scrap of faded mosaic, which might signal a ruin nearby or just be a mystery. This is a huge reason to use the weather tables, PITA as they are. It will really make the PCs feel they are *there*.<br/><br/>If they're doing "true" sandbox, just setting out into the unknown to get into trouble, you may need to make more detailed maps beforehand. Remember, though, random generator with tweaking is your friend. Done properly, it should take them a while to be satisfied with a single hex. And remember too, this activity is VERY DANGEROUS. There are no real "levels" in the wilderness. You turn the corner and see a band of giants, you'll have to deal with them somehow, even if you're only ready for goblins. Done judiciously, this can control player actions without railroading or any semblance of coercion. Then they put a big red X on their map (and you do too...now they have something to work toward/come back to). <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vanveen" title="Vanveen"><img alt="Vanveen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vanveen">Vanveen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428887/#Comment_428887" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-27T08:43:52+00:00" title="February 27, 2014  8:43AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ChristopherWeeks is taking the "lazy DM" approach, which is highly effective depending on your tastes/group's style of play. It gets games played, most importantly. <br/><br/>If you haven't read the famous <a href="http://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/78/grand-experiments-west-marches/" rel="nofollow">West Marches thread</a>, I think you may find it very inspiring and entertaining.<br/><br/>I'm an overprepper, something I'm cutting down on. I like drawing sub-megahex maps (if a megahex is 25 miles across, it will be made up of 5 5-mile hexes, or 25 1-mile hexes, depending on your template). It's at least the illusion of greater control. So I might prep four or five of these around  the party's starting point...much less work than it used to be in the old days, and then keep adding hexes as I have time or the party wanders closer to them. If I need to slow them down, I might put a bigger dungeon or ruin somewhere they are likely to run across it, or of course they might hear about it somewhere. They may stay busy with that for a number of sessions, giving me the time to at least sketch out other directions, rumors, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428892/#Comment_428892" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-27T10:31:23+00:00" title="February 27, 2014 10:31AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My procedure from our latest campaign in short was quite simple, as I attempted to balance a boardgame-like aesthetic with various realistic considerations:<br/>- Hex width of ~6 miles or so, with the assumption that even the canonical referee map might not <i>necessarily</i> contain perfect geographic information.<br/>- The referee preps the geography and provides mostly empty hex sheets for player mapping, with major landmarks, roads and such indicated to whatever degree seems reasonable. I like to prep each hex with population density, hilliness of the terrain, major roads and rivers; the traditional scheme involves plains vs. forests vs. deserts vs. swamps, which I don't find that useful for e.g. European terrain. (Makes much more sense if you're emulating American geography, note.)<br/>- An ordinary daily march is three hexes, with a few extra by forced march possible; one hex less in hill country, one hex less "through underbrush", one hex more along major road, one hex less with heavy encumbrance. Mounts do not increase daily march by default, but they increase carrying capacity and make forced marches much easier. (The assumption here is that ordinary hex-to-hex travel happens along country roads or trails that add e.g. 20% or more to real travel distances. "Underbrush" means slogging through your stereotypical fantasy swamp and such clearly difficult terrain.)<br/>- Each day weather and such ancillary details are randomized according to referee's currently preferred procedure. Snow on the ground is again one less hex of travel distance, heavy rains indicate constitution checks, etc.<br/>- Upon entering each hex the referee makes a random encounter check, 1/6 chance. The type of encounter depends on the location. The same check is made for every 6 hours spent in a single hex. The encounter particulars may come out of suitable tables or whatever, depends on the groundwork laid for the matter.<br/><br/>All this stuff can be found in the game texts themselves as well, though. Mentzer red box, for example, has pretty clear explanation of the basics, I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428900">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428900/#Comment_428900" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-27T12:41:46+00:00" title="February 27, 2014 12:41PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, a word about scale as well, which Martin specifically asked about: for me it's pretty natural to have lo-level adventures occur in a relatively small geographical area, so that the adventurers don't need to do much expensive travel to shuttle around. I might say that longer journeys are often mid-level concerns (with the understanding that we partly recognize the mid-level play's arrival by the fact that players choose in fact to undertake longer journeys). Thus it's not an immediate concern at the beginning of the campaign as to where an entirely different, exotic adventure might be set.<br/><br/>Later on, when our campaign started expanding from fantasy-Holland, first to the Holy Roman Empire, then to Italy and Eastern Europe, and to distant colonial lands, I used two strategies for coping with the distances: one is to shift scale as necessary to use e.g. 30-mile hexes for mapping larger stretches of ground for which we don't need as much detail, while another is to utilize separate mapped "theaters" of action, with travel between the theaters hand-waved (or simply proceduralized in some other manner; hexcrawl is not the only way to move around, after all).<br/><br/>I'd say that if the campaign was about serious travel around a mostly well-known world, then I wouldn't use hexcrawl as the primary procedure. For example, a network of trade cities with stretches of wilderness in between, connected by caravan routes, might be a very viable sandbox for even low-level play; characters might accompany caravans (perhaps as caravan guards, if they're typically martial mercenary adventurers) and skip from town to town even right from the beginning as adventuring opportunities dry up or characters establish enemies in individual locales. In that type of campaign structure I'd find it natural to prep a freeform map of the trade network, with a distance (or a vectored distance / travel difficulty value) indicated for each leg of commonly used route. Then I might set up just a bit of hex action around each individual town as campaign moves into new places, perhaps just a couple hexes around each town in case the players have reason to get out into the wilderness. This way my mapping efforts would result in several very small hexcrawls (like, a dozen hexes each) connected by linear routes that use a different travel procedure from the normal hex-by-hex used locally.<br/><br/>Ultimately the good reasons for using hexes are all about boardgame aesthetics and the usefulness of gamifying the exploration with simplifications; there's no reason not to use real distance measurements on a map without hexes, it's just simpler and in some ways aesthetically satisfying to ping the map hex by hex. Players like to be able to add in a new hex on their map as they come close enough to discover basic terrain information or similar about it, and it's fun and easy to e.g. explore places hex by hex, making a single search roll for each hex, or whatever. Also useful to abstractly pretend that it's sufficient to know which hex you're in at a time (instead of arbitrary precision), and to have all the various hex-based abstractions of distance, time and other logistical matters at hand. It's often said that hexes are used because it's easy to calculate distances with them, but frankly that's something I could do better with any old measuring stick on a scale map; the real strength of the hex is as a hook for mechanical gamifying procedure, where the hex maps acts as a sort of a game board.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428908/#Comment_428908" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-27T15:36:37+00:00" title="February 27, 2014  3:36PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 27, 2014 3:36PM by David_Berg.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A friend of mine uses 2-mile hexes when he GMS, and he tracks resources and threats in each hex entered.<br/><br/>The minor part: a hex that has been "harvested" for whatever it had (herbs, fruit, timber, etc.) can't be harvested again for a certain amount of in-game time.<br/><br/>The major part: once a hex has been "pacified", the GM rolls half as often for wandering monsters on it.<br/><br/>This is a "random encounters in a single extensive dungeon" model (in this case the dungeon is an island), as opposed to the "random modules on a map" model.

This simplicity can then cascade to help with more complex quantitatives; even if it is relatively simple to measure or estimate distance between point A and point B, that small loss of simplicity in dropping the hexes multiplies into much more hassle when you're solving a logistical problem involving points A, B, C, D and E, five donkeys, three carts full of hay, and a road network compromised by a muddy spring.

You can only encounter <i>so much</i> in X or Y amount of travel. Really, my proposed alternative would just use landmarks - players would have to be aiming at specific landmarks - as the measure of travel and the quantification process; then it's the same as with hexes in quickly estimating the time that journey would take, its costs and encounters on the road before agreeing with players. <br/>So not a "real" map quite yet, but one with all the landmarks of a hex and the expected travel times between each. Points-of-light style play, maybe? That said, there's really not much difference in the two in my eyes - I suppose hexes make it easier to denote the passing of time for the players, which I certainly struggle with. <br/><br/>Is there a precedent in sea-hex sandboxes? I'm curious as it if there is any procedural difference to sailing on a hexmap than to overland travel - I've been playing too much <i>Wind Waker</i> recently.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429045">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429045/#Comment_429045" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-03T03:42:40+00:00" title="March  3, 2014  3:42AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            People seem to do seafaring hexcrawls occasionally, yes. I don't see why it wouldn't work, certainly a quite valid topic.<br/><br/>Regarding defining spatial relations with waypoints and a web of points of interest, that's well and good for lightweight travel setups. However, when more time is spent on the logistical, exploratory and survival aspects of play, it is often necessary to have a high degree of freedom and a neutral board upon which the players may act. A landmark scheme suffers in this context for being necessarily teleological: the referee has, while setting up the map, determined what things are important and what things aren't. It is not uncommon in hexcrawl play for the players to find meaning in completely unexpected places, which is not possible if action occurs in a predefined web of predefined points of interest.<br/><br/>Aside from that issue, though, a web is very feasible. I've got this 19th century D&amp;D campaign at planning stages where global travel is handled in this way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429046/#Comment_429046" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-03T04:04:33+00:00" title="March  3, 2014  4:04AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds reasonable - I take your argument about teleology. <br/><br/>I'd love to run a Viking-themed 1000AD sea campaign. 19th Century sounds hot though, get some 20,000 Leagues/War of the Worlds action in there.

I wanted to generate everything (or as much as possible, anyway) randomly, then use logic and my imagination to tie it together into a sensible whole. I went back to the seminal <i>Wilderlands of High Fantasy</i> books and read up a lot on how other people run hexcrawls before arriving at my current approach. After reading up on a lot of OSR rulesets, I settled on <i>Adventurer Conqueror King</i>.<br/><br/>Here's the procedure I've been using:<br/><br/>1) Generate the world map using <a href="http://donjon.bin.sh/fantasy/world/" rel="nofollow">donjon's fantasy world generator</a>.<br/>2) Choose a region of the map to be the frontier area where the campaign would occur.<br/>3) Use the civilization and pantheon generators at <a href="http://chaoticshiny.com/regiongen.php" rel="nofollow">Chaotic Shiny</a> to get a starting point for the dominant culture.<br/>4) Use <a href="http://www.welshpiper.com/hex-based-campaign-design-part-1/" rel="nofollow">The Welsh Piper's hexcrawl methodology</a> to zoom-in on the starting region and each adjacent region and determine major sites of interest.<br/>5) Write a paragraph about each major site with an eye toward tying them into their physical context and regional history, allowing new ideas to emerge.<br/>6) Choose a base of operations for the PCs.<br/>7) Start playing.<br/>8) Rely upon a host of random generation tables whenever anything needs fleshing out.<br/><br/>This is obviously not a low-prep approach, but a major part of the appeal of a hexcrawl for me is in building a world from randomly-generated components, and it satisfies a major creative itch. To that end, after much pdf-purchasing and reading, these are my go-to tomes of tables:<br/><br/><i><a href="http://www.newbigdragon.com/accessories.html" rel="nofollow">D30 DM Companion</a></i> from New Big Dragon Games<br/><i><a href="http://www.newbigdragon.com/accessories.html" rel="nofollow">D30 Sandbox Companion</a></i> from New Big Dragon Games<br/><i><a href="http://www.midkemia.com/HomePage/Products.html" rel="nofollow">Cities</a></i> from Midkemia Press<br/><i><a href="http://talesofthefroggod.com/mother-all-encounter-tables" rel="nofollow">The Mother of All Encounter Tables</a></i> from Frog God Games<br/><i><a href="http://talesofthefroggod.com/mother-all-treasure-tables" rel="nofollow">The Mother of All Treasure Tables</a></i> from Frog God Games<br/><i><a href="http://talesofthefroggod.com/tome-adventure-design" rel="nofollow">The Tome of Adventure Design</a></i> from Frog God Games<br/><a href="http://rpggeek.com/filepage/60418/random-weather-and-travel-tables" rel="nofollow">Fan-made weather tables</a> for <i>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay</i><br/><br/>I also wrote up a master wilderness encounter table that incorporates incidental things like equipment breakage, environmental details, and notable landmarks into the usual monster encounter stuff.<br/><br/>An example of how I used these resources: the PCs returned from their first foray into the wilderness. Each time they move through a district in their home-base town, I roll on the encounter tables in the <i>Cities</i> book. Many of these encounters result in narrative color or no notable event, but in this case, I rolled "Pilgrim hiring escort for holy quest," and then rolled "cave" as the goal of the quest. Then I used the <i>D30 Sandbox Companion</i> to roll up the NPC pilgrim's details (gender, personality, etc.). Because it's a frontier region and the pilgrim is looking for a cave, I decided that his deity is the goddess of the wild (already penciled in from initial pantheon generation). One of his random personality traits is "has visions," so I decide his goddess comes to him in his sleep and tell hims that he needs to go purify this cave in the wilderness on her behalf. So he tells the PCs all this, offering them gold to act as his escort, and they debate whether he is a lunatic or not before agreeing to the job. Once they agree to the job, I spend a little time fleshing out notable sites between their home base and location of the cave, and use the <i>Tome of Adventure Design</i> (an amazing book!) to generate some details about the cave itself.<br/><br/>Trying to do all of this at the table would be a big challenge, but it's perfect for play-by-post. I can take the time I need to generate stuff, give it more thought than I would be able to do in a face-to-face setting, and then write it up as a narrative. The next face-to-face campaign I run will likely be some kind of hexcrawl with more participatory world-building, and this experience is helping me figure out how I might streamline the process to keep play from bogging down at the table.<br/><br/>If you're interested in seeing how it has played out so far, you can read the thread <a href="http://brokenforum.com/index.php?threads/pbf-wilds-of-far-atabask.7130/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429254">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429254/#Comment_429254" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-08T17:12:22+00:00" title="March  8, 2014  5:12PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 8, 2014 6:44PM by akooser.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sea hex crawl kit <br/><a href="http://dndwithpornstars.blogspot.com/2011/04/wavecrawl-kit.html" rel="nofollow">dndwithpornstars.blogspot.com/2011/04/wavecrawl-kit.html</a><br/><br/>Harn has a good sea crawl book, I think it's called Pilot's almanac.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429256">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429256/#Comment_429256" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-08T17:31:52+00:00" title="March  8, 2014  5:31PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What I really want is something that gives me encounters and wandering monsters for different terrain types, any thoughts?                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429260">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429260/#Comment_429260" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-08T18:44:31+00:00" title="March  8, 2014  6:44PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">@Potemkin</a> forgot the link to the sea hex crawl tables.

The way I do it is, I use a generic encounter table until they've had half a dozen or so encounters, and then use those encounters to help define the region further. Each random encounter demands a lair for the creature encountered, so I place those, and then gradually develop the "web of life" for the area building off of the encounters rolled. So it's a bottom-up approach, but the goal is still to give the area a particular flavor. After a certain point, if they roll up something too far off from the ecosystem that has been developing, I just tweak it to make it fit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429309/#Comment_429309" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-10T06:38:48+00:00" title="March 10, 2014  6:38AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That map makes me want to play!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Big_J_Money" title="Big_J_Money"><img alt="Big_J_Money" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Big_J_Money">Big_J_Money</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429742/#Comment_429742" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-22T14:21:16+00:00" title="March 22, 2014  2:21PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hope this isn't too OT, but since much of this thread is about random encounters, I was wondering if anyone ever rolls on additional tables when rolling up an encounter with a monster.<br/><br/>Things like: mood, agenda, current situation, plot device, etc.<br/><br/>I know some encounter tables include these as entries in the main table, but I was thinking one could get more bank for their buck by having multidimensional tables to create an effectively "infinite" amount of combinations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/adamwb" title="adamwb"><img alt="adamwb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/adamwb">adamwb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429754/#Comment_429754" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-23T00:38:00+00:00" title="March 23, 2014 12:38AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some of those are ground trod upon the three sort-of built in subtables: surprise, reaction, and treasure/lair.

I want the random encounters to fit to the world, the region, the circumstances, and I also want to have a strong dose of other people's ideas, rather than just exploring the kind of content I come up with. Therefore, a mix of my own ideas and published materials seems like a good plan.<br/><br/>Some questions:\n<ol>\n<li>How long are your random encounter tables normally? Do you just have a handful for a region or huge tables with hundreds of items or something in between? Why?</li>\n<li>What are good existing resources of random encounter tables? Jason, above, suggested the Mother of All Encounter Tables, which has good reviews and is obviously a great resource at only $10. However, I have already spent a bit of money of this campaign's prep so far, and given that this is an experiment that may not be continued if doesn't work with my playgroup, I'd rather keep to free resources for now.</li>\n<li>How do you blend your own ideas with random encounter tables?

Is this a thing you have continued to do, or was it only for short period? If you have, could you describe how you go about this?  Do you prefer/disprefer this?

The Grey Sands IRC game for instance, where I've been GMing some hexcrawling portions, has mostly relied on improvised choices on my part.<br/><br/>I explained the basics of my method in IRC the other day. To put it succinctly, my method relies on building a quick list of likely, obvious encounter possibilities in my head, and then randomly filtering through them. The goal is to create results that are mostly obvious and make sense in the context, but also range towards the unexpected, and maintain variety.<br/><br/>In practice what I do is, I choose a single potential random encounter, and then roll a 50/50 check to see if I may accept that as the event to occur here. If not, then I imagine another alternative, and do the same. I continue until the coin allows me to use the idea. The logic in this procedure is simply that I am most likely to think of obvious and reasonable ideas first, and exotic and unlikely ideas last (this wouldn't necessarily be the case, but this is what I intentionally strive for when using this technique), so this way 50% of the time I end up running the most obvious and ordinary encounter that happens to jump to mind. This also maintains hygiene in that even at my most subjective I can do no more than put an undeserving encounter on top of the pile, from whence it'll still get discarded 50% of the time. So even if I subconsciously (or consciously for that matter) wanted something to happen really hard, the dice are still the final arbiter.<br/><br/>I can't say that I strongly recommend this method for extensive hexcrawling, as it tends to produce somewhat subjective (and occasionally predictable) results. It's fine for short-term minor improvisation, and I recommend it for when you just have to fill in some time at the end of a session or something like that. The method also has some advantages in being organic, varied and imaginative in comparison to more mechanical alternatives. Overall, though, I would recommend that a GM less lazy than I am should rather use real random encounter processes instead of just improvising stuff <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>For your purposes, I recommend the following light yet powerful random encounter table procedure that I've developed for my own use:<br/>1) Divide your hex map into regions that you want to share a feel; each such region will get their own random encounter tables.<br/>2) Create five ordinary random encounters for each region; three common ones, two slightly less common. These will be 85% of everything encountered in random encounters. No unique encounters here, although if some encounter no longer makes sense for some reason, replace it with the next most common thing encountered in the region.<br/>3) Create a special encounters table for the region. It consists of "an encounter from the past of a PC or the party", "an encounter from the closest dungeon or neighboring region", and at least one region-specific special encounter. This is the appropriate place for encounters relating to specific individuals or places, as well as rare encounters that are nearly one of a kind. The special encounters table will mostly consist of unique encounters that you remove when they've been used. Generally you'll want to make it so that you have at least three entries here all the time: the loose string from the past events encounter, the roaming encounter from some other encounter table, and the local weirdness thing that gets replaced with a new one if and when the adventurers find whatever it was.<br/>4) When using the tables, you first roll on the ordinary encounter table on a d6; results 1-5 are as written. If you roll a 6, then you that means you reroll on the special encounters table. You randomize between however many entries there are on that one.<br/>5) When the probability of some encounter has been greatly heightened, such as when the PCs are trying to bait a specific type of animal to appear, or when the orcs have specifically invaded this region and are thus in almost every bush, just roll a 50% chance prior to going to the tables to see if instead of the normal encounter they instead get the special of the day.<br/>6) If a given region sees a lot of use, feel free to expand any particular entry on the main table into a subtable instead. Like, replace "Stirges" with "dangerous animals", and then create a subtable that has more options in addition to the stirges. Or switch from a d6 table to a d8 table, to make room for a couple more entries. The tables for each region are intentionally compact here, though, so don't just add stuff because you feel like you got to have everything that could possibly make an appearance be on that table; it's better to cycle things in and out rather than have a hundred entries, to establish a more interesting and relatable environment.<br/><br/>I personally think that the above method, while still being manageable even on the flight, provides a pleasingly boardgame-ish feel for the proceedings. It also contains some relatively powerful features, such as the ever-present chance of an old ally or enemy appearing, and the chance that a local dungeon's exotic monster population expands its territory into the wilderness. Players will also like mapping the extent of such encounter regions; the adventure geography will feel more important and interesting to them if they know that the Black Hills and the Flint Hills have somewhat different encounter profiles, instead of both using the same "hills terrain" table.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430680/#Comment_430680" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-08T06:03:29+00:00" title="April  8, 2014  6:03AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 8, 2014 6:06AM by ChristopherWeeks.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have a random generator that I've been tinkering with off and on for years at this point.

Also, because having things phrased properly for all combinations of clauses is a tricky problem, there is a fair amount of in-use GM improvisation to make sense of things.  For instance, what does "abomination" mean?  Is "unusually-sized" giant or tiny?  Is a "troll toad" the toad of a troll or a chimera of sorts or what?  The generator doesn't presume to answer all things, it assumes the GM can handle the improv.  And occasionally it still generates nonsense though that's much less frequent than when I was first building the tool.<br/><br/>I also play with these where many of the results are only going to happen once and then be replaced by something reasonable to encounter more than once, unlike e.g. "albino hostile politician".<br/><br/>I very much prefer to roll on a curved distribution because it tells me more about the place.  Martin, you mention wanting the encounters to fit the region.  My approach is to let the region arise from the tables.  And you can see, of course, that my 6 and 8 results help to build regional contiguity.  But certainly not as much as an actually intentionally-developed system would.<br/><br/>And finally, you don't see any here, because I just generated these three hexes for this conversation but an option that can appear in the table is "a for-real dungeon module adventure thing" which causes me to whip out a published (or at least worked up in advance) adventure (Keep on the Borderlands, Dyson's Delve or a one-page thing that I wrote up a year ago for another game...) and plug it into the hex.<br/><hr style="width: 50%;"/><br/>ETA: I also generate a table for each hex that gives ideas for what might be happening when players return to it as a known place like:<br/><br/>1\tA small band of foreigners is dying of starvation here.<br/>2\tA snow-storm has blown up.<br/>3\tenormous ants are a serious nuisance.<br/>4\tA swarm of centipede is preying on this locale.<br/>5\tA magic-storm has blown up.<br/>6\tDead livestock lay covered in flies.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430686">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430686/#Comment_430686" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-08T07:50:09+00:00" title="April  8, 2014  7:50AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 8, 2014 7:50AM by Potemkin.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, this isn\u2019t quite hexcrawling per se but I\u2019ve got a project rolling around up in here that involves some hex-work and heavy reliance on events tables \u2013 the discussion so far has given me much food for thought but any more directed advice would be appricated. <br/><br/>Basically the concept is a kingdom administration game that rehabilitates the war-game aspect of OSR back into my day-to-day play. The play is a little abstracted right now but I imagine each player would have a noble PC that would be their authoritative avatar in the game (\u201cDuke/Duchess\u201d seems about right at the moment) who have a limited number of agents (retainers in the language of D&amp;D) such as knights, courtiers, spies and sages who can be sent off \u201cinto the field\u201d so to speak to conduct the business of ruling the kingdom of which each player has a share. Nominally there is a \u201cking\u201d role and I\u2019m not sure yet whether the king is an NPC, a DMPC or a player\u2019s Duke elected to the throne by the others at the start of play. The spirit of the game is one collaboration but with space enough to allow for PvP jostling without players quitting the table. <br/><br/>As you might have anticipated the scope of this idea requires an initial hex generation stage as each player assembles his duchy, a region within the kingdom. It seems likely that the entire breadth of the kingdom would be known to its rulers (aside from those areas outside any travel links at all, mountainous highlands, deserts, oceans etc) so there\u2019d be quite a lot of hex-building from the get go. Is there any recommendation you\u2019d make as to constructing tables for interesting, populated regions? <br/><br/>Hexcrawling comes back into it with the assumption that the world continues outside the Kingdom\u2019s boarders \u2013 each game month/season there might be a chance of some foreign development (diplomats, raiders, traders, invaders, allies and rumours from abroad) even if the players are totally self-involved in governance. Ultimately though I\u2019d be interested in leaving players the option to survey a foreign region, raise an army and invade. Would hexcrawling as an army (as opposed to a dozen-strong party) involve a different set of exploration tables? I imagine bumping into a bear is less worrying if you happen to be travelling with 10,000 armed men.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430689/#Comment_430689" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-08T09:25:47+00:00" title="April  8, 2014  9:25AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Last sunday I had my players lead an army through an hexcrawl; it's almost the same as with players, though positioning here considers groups of people (divisions, individual teams, etc) instead of separated players. You can have players lead different groups inside the army and asking them for reaction only when the random encounter affects their group. For example, the bear wouldn't actualy come out of his lair or perhaps will run away at the sound of a whole army, but will probably fight to death if cornered by a small group. If there's a PC on that group, the encounter goes as usual. If not, an officer appears to inform a PC that X group found a bear and either won or sustainned 1d6 casualties. I also let players use several diferent NPCs inside the army, which helped a lot to make it feel like a full living army instead of PCs surrounded by a bunch of extras without initiative.<br/><br/>I'd say, use your regular encounter table less (since most animals will just run away at the sound or a marching army) and use organized enemies more like a guerrilla with hit and run tactics focused on stalling the PC army or stealing/destroying/poisoning their supplies.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430690/#Comment_430690" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-08T11:16:39+00:00" title="April  8, 2014 11:16AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What scale hex were you using?

Another player had already told us about Eye-trees in the local forest, which is a way sweeter name for Treants, and this person told us a story about the time that he had seen such beings in the Forest of Borland. Or Borlan. Not sure tbh.<br/><br/>I also knew that, on the map, it was east of our british and vikingish places and not far from a big place that I had loosely penciled in as northeastern europe, given a German-sounding name by players but in my mind a little bit of an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PaIz2HKV5w" rel="nofollow">\u201call the Russias\u201d</a> flavour. I figure maybe these places were once part of the same empire before it split up. Tsars are cool.<br/><br/>So I wanted to make an encounter chart for the cold woods at winter, inspired by that link, and by you know, Peter and the Wolf, as well as the eye-trees.<br/><br/>My first pass, 1d12:<br/><br/>1\u20133 - wolves (warg, winter, or were)<br/>4 - eye-trees<br/>5 - woodcutters<br/>6\u20137 - trolls/ogres<br/>8\u20139 - great cats (based on an encouter I had rolled off the default swords &amp; wizardry charts the week before, when I was unprepared, and also there is totally a cat in Peter and the Wolf amirite: wild cats, displacer beasts, leucrotta, lamia, manticore)<br/>10 - hags (obvs we need <a href="http://wampuscountry.blogspot.ca/2011/12/time-of-witch.html" rel="nofollow">some sweet witches</a>)<br/>11 - terrified villagers<br/>12 - lost children<br/><br/>But this was just notes. I knew that there was a better version. I changed it to a 2d6 table, threw in some purely event-based encounters, and spread it so that I could roll at -1 in the clear areas near villages, and +1 in the dense wild bits of forest. The players were attempting to find a great oak tree, the likes of which we don't even have in the world anymore, to build an unusual longship to travel the skies, so I knew that there was a good odds that their adventure would be driven by searching hexes for what they were looking for. It played out quite differently than what we did with Eero the other week, because they have all kinds of crazy abilities like talking to birds and levitating to the treetops and asking God where to look. So they found it.<br/><br/>But I wrote up a very complete chart and look forward to the next time I get to play this area. * = see below<br/><br/>2d6 (+1 in heavy forest, -1 in farms, +0 in light forest and hills)<br/><br/>1\u20135: Men<br/>1 - farmers<br/>2 - ugly villagers<br/>3 - lost children<br/>4 - men on a quest*<br/>5 - woodsmen (1\u20133 woodcutters, 4\u20135 huntsmen, 6 an old man / 1d6-1 in number + 2d6 dogs if hunting)<br/><br/>6\u20137: events<br/>6 - unusual natural encounter*<br/>7 - thick snow or brambles<br/><br/>8\u201313: monsters<br/>8 - animal monsters*<br/>9 - ogres (1-3 ogres, 4 ogre magi, 5 trolls, 6 roll twice)<br/>10 - eye-trees<br/>11 - hags<br/>12 - the dead<br/>13 - <a href="http://random-generator.com/index.php?title=Elf-folk" rel="nofollow">faerie folk</a> (would be * but I already made this table separately long ago<br/><br/>Subtables<br/><br/>Questing<br/>1 - 1d6 inept brothers looking for something to win the princess' hand (level 1d4-1, they are out of their league out here)<br/>2 - 1d6 mean brothers (level 1d6+1), similar quest, who stole their younger brother's silver (he's probably a magic-user level 1d6 tho, he'll show them in the end)<br/>3 - a Knight and his retinue<br/>4 - a small group of outlaws<br/>5 - large group of outlaws<br/>6 - roll again and roll another encounter, maybe it's a fight<br/><br/>Unusual Natural Encounter<br/>I'ma keep this one secret still but it has wild mundane animals and old altars and mysterious stuff and bones and\u2026<br/><br/>Animal Monsters 2d6<br/>Cats, wolves, birds, something special at 12. You know.<br/><br/>What's not here: most of my random encounter tables sometimes produce dragons or roll on an all-purpose list of unique characters of this part of the world (I cross them out and replace them with someone new when they get used). This place is a little different I guess, and is a fair way from the area where they know anybody. However, if they were near certain places I would interpret the hags or huntsmen as being specific groups, or the elves and birds too. And there's something on that unusual natural encounters chart that could involve these things.<br/><br/>Also, should have included more bears. If play returns here again I will revise.<br/><br/>There's lots of encounters already written into hexes on the map section I blew up to 6 miles, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430712">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Charles" title="Charles"><img alt="Charles" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Charles">Charles</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430712/#Comment_430712" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-08T20:24:20+00:00" title="April  8, 2014  8:24PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 8, 2014 10:03PM by Charles.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, I tried out something like Eero's technique (high / low roll is a d6 die of fate sort of thing):<br/><br/><b>Twisted Hills</b><br/>1.\tHigh roll wolf hunter, low roll starving wolves<br/>2.\tSmall group of outlaws (neutral).

The hex becomes irradiated and all forests and fields are burned. Food and potable water can never again be foraged from that hex. If there was a human settlement there, Kaiju kills 1d% of its level 1 population automatically and named NPC's must make saving throws vs. death to try and survive. <br/>If Kaiju passes through a hex inhabited by men of chaotic alignment, all the surviving men will worship Kaiju and follow him. <br/>Lawful men will deal damage to Kaiju if they are armed with alien weaponry.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430737">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430737/#Comment_430737" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-09T08:12:09+00:00" title="April  9, 2014  8:12AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd reccomend everyone to turn your random tables into a deck of cards; it's even faster to handle than rolling all dice at once and consult the tables in order.

I love the conceptual weight of charts (random tables, event procedure? What's the term we're using here?) and how they distribute fictional impositions into play in nice chunks. Love making them, too: the structure reminds me faintly of having to write sonnets and haikus in school. Cutting down a perspective on the world into 10 punchy events appeals. There should really be a master directory of all OSR tables online... an <i>Encyclop\xe6dia Chartannica</i>? <br/><br/>The Army Campaign Chart is heavily abstracted and its use is really only to replicate a campaign of fortune: marching into unknown but hostile territory and pushing your luck. How many battles will you have before you have to return home? This sort of blind crusading probably fails to replicate the real movement and objectives of an army but strikes me as totally high fantasy in a war-quest kind of way. <br/>"What is over there, man?" <i>"An Elf castle, my Lord."</i> "Very good, we attack at dawn!" - As you can see, it's all a bit blood thirsty and senseless. The Enemy is very abstract, only defined when stumbled upon by the player (that is to say that I hadn't planned as a DM to position castles and maneuverer unseen armies - rather, just give the player an empty section of hex and let them go wild). The chart emphasises the importance of scouts and good reconnaissance which, at this level of abstraction, is tantamount to activating a table roll without exposing your precious army to any danger. It would be very easy to alter the flavour to invoke the sandstorms and thirst of a desert crusade or a horrifying, mud-strewn 60-year campaign across northern Europe. <br/><br/>If I were to actually use this chart in some kind of Kingmaker game I'd probably designate the size of an Enemy territory, its general terrain and its the total strength of its forces. Each time there was a military victory I'd tick down on the number of enemies (or maybe an abstracted level of resistance?), eventually meaning that the opposing forces are broken and you can claim your new land. This of course means rolling on a hypothetical "Occupying Unfriendly Territory" chart - the best results in which being that you are perceived as ruling fairly and win the people's love. The worst being that you are constantly beset by clandestine attempts to destabilise your shit (Robin Hood appears here).  <br/><br/>Ultimately I'd like to refine it into a lovely machine that both saps an army's strength (and sends the player back home in shame) and replenishes its men and resources (letting them push on) - depending on the roll. A perpetual campaigning machine. <br/><br/>I feel you, Kurisu. I'm going to get to work on a second chart that's a "Spoils &amp; Horrors" table that gets rolled every week/month in the field to show the various colourful treasures and diseases an army on the road might accumulate.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430784">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430784/#Comment_430784" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-10T02:28:26+00:00" title="April 10, 2014  2:28AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            With the Fortune modifications, I got a very nice Heroes of Might and Magic vibe from it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430787">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430787/#Comment_430787" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-10T03:50:06+00:00" title="April 10, 2014  3:50AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I need to play with the Fortune economy but I like the idea of players rolling on a table and knowing that they're up against it if they have low fortune.

Why not 2d4 or 2d6 and have a smoother curve from likely to less likely to rare?</blockquote>\nCleaner semantics and easier maintenance. The clear divide between "common" and "special" encounters works for me personally, as I treat the two differently in designing them: the common encounter is about demographics and sense of place, while the special encounter is essentially a mini-adventure with NPCs leveled in strange classes, unique monsters and so on. As an arbitrary example: talking with local farmers about what the Black Hills are like will let you take a peek at the common encounters table, but not the special encounters list; the common table involves on-going, omnipresent, integral elements of what the place is, so anybody living in the area can pretty much list out those things for you.<br/><br/>Note that from a realism standpoint there really isn't a smooth encounter frequency gradient between "you meet a deer" and "you meet Abraxias the Dragon" when discussing a region of hundreds of square miles; there are 500 deer in that forest, yet only one Abraxias. The concept of a special encounter in itself is a dramatized model of adventuresome unlikeliness.<br/><br/>Note that if I want a curved random distribution with smoother gradients, I prefer to roll bonus or penalty dice into the roll - that is, roll two and pick lowest, or whatever. This has the advantage of being less inflexible about the shape of the bell curve, and it can be adjusted on the flight. Generally, though, I've concluded that this type of regional, punchy, practical random encounter table does not benefit from a bell curve.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431085">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431085/#Comment_431085" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-16T05:33:47+00:00" title="April 16, 2014  5:33AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 16, 2014 5:34AM by Potemkin.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Generally, though, I've concluded that this type of regional, punchy, practical random encounter table does not benefit from a bell curve.</blockquote>\nThis language is telling - I think part of the charm of snappy 1d6 tables is that they're quick to populate and manipulate on the fly. They're utile tools. Trying to factor for the 2d6 bell probabilities just junks up my natural creative flow. Dunno if this is the case for you, but it certainly appeals to my edge-of-the-seat DMing style. Real prep?

This does not always mean "rule of cool" or whatever, but it does mean that time moves faster over boring bits, coincidences that could happen do happen more often that you'd expect, and so on. PCs meet Abraxas all of a 10% of the time when hanging in its territory, where NPC farmers only meet it 0.1% of the time.<br/><br/>All the rules about regulating e.g. random encounters are as much about allowing the cool stuff to occur (to legitimize that the GM is not just arbitrarily feeding us to Abraxias) as they are about encouraging it to occur; they replace a GM's subjective sense of pacing and drama with an arbitrary system. We often call this a strive towards "realism", but what we actually mean is a sort of enhanced yet arbitrary reality in tension between adventure drama and real concerns.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431161">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden" title="MartinEden"><img alt="MartinEden" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/728/nG1YHA4QTUL1O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden">MartinEden</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431161/#Comment_431161" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-17T03:21:12+00:00" title="April 17, 2014  3:21AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How specific do you make entries in these kind of encounter tables? For example, I have started off by creating the encounter table for the Odenwald, a settled and populous region of my hex-map. I thought that a good thing to have in the "common" part of my table was some kind of travelling merchants. So what should the entry look like on my table? Here are some options:\n<ol>\n<li>1d6 merchants</li>\n<li>A peddler</li>\n<li>A peddler hawking strange herbs and delicious spices.</li>\n<li>Boris the spice peddler, hawking strange herbs and delicious spices. He has a limp, an eye-patch, and he's on his way to the Odd Bazaar in Obendorf.</li>\n</ol>\nI assume from the fact that these entries are not meant to be one use that the first or second option is appropriate here. But at that point I am concerned that the table doesn't give me much to get my creative juices going. I'd rather get 3 from a table, and then I'd probably improvise from there to get something like 4.<br/><br/>My thought was, maybe I should have leave it as "1d6 merchants", and then create myself a random table of merchants with more specific flavour on.

If the differences between these really mattered to me, I'd make a subtable.<br/><br/>The reason for the sparse detail is that I do not need the random encounter table to help me create detail, I just need it to determine a subject matter. Once I know that this encounter is a merchant, I can randomize or determine where they're from, how big an operation, where they're going, their wares, honest or dishonest, personality quirks, etc., ultimately ending up with something unique, although not necessarily important in tactical or strategic terms.<br/><br/>If I regressed in terms of my ability to improvise fictional detail, and found that "it's a merchant" no longer were enough for me to provide a flavourful encounter, then my chosen method for compensating would be to premake a list of merchant encounters. So the table would still have the sparse and abstracted encounter category of "traveling merchants" or whatever, and whenever that came up, I'd just take the next specific merchant off my list of pre-prepared encounters. No point to randomizing between Mike the Merchant and Pavel the Peddler, I can just have a list of like 20 of them and use them from top to bottom. They're one-use after all, and I'll need to create more anyway when and if I run out.<br/><br/>If you find that you generally prefer to have more verbose random encounter tables (like Martin's option #3), then I don't think that's particularly a problem. I personally would either rely on subtables (to still have variety), or replace that entry once it'd come up a few times (to avoid noticeable repeating), or accept that the encounter table has a little bit of a fairy tale style going with it - not everything needs to be ultra-realistic, I think it'd be a fun feature of a campaign for the random encounters to be somewhat strangely specific and repeating. This just happens to be a region where 1/6th of your random encounters are with herb &amp; spice peddlers. Sort of like constantly encountering grandmoms selling apples.

I would personally put it on the main table (so it's common enough), and have it simply read: "Secondary signs of an encounter, making it possible to track it to wherever it went. Roll again for type; repeating this result indicates old and mysterious track that vanishes soon."<br/><br/>Also, speaking of these types of meta-encounters (which I think are a powerful way to bolster a random encounter table): I myself generally consider an encounter cause for an immediate encounter roll, which means that on occasion you get double encounters, where two things from the encounter table are present at once. However, instead of making the encounter check exploding (which is what this basically is), you could also have an entry in the special encounters subtable for "Double encounter: roll again twice". It's sort of the opposite of the "signs of an encounter" modality in that instead of having only a hint of a real encounter, you get two encounters at once.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden" title="MartinEden"><img alt="MartinEden" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/728/nG1YHA4QTUL1O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden">MartinEden</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431271/#Comment_431271" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-19T01:31:37+00:00" title="April 19, 2014  1:31AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 19, 2014 1:32AM by MartinEden.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So maybe something like this.

They can work if you have prepared the production system so that you have everything at your fingertips (blank cards, etc.), or if you're making something that doesn't need to be revised on the flight. The biggest issue from my viewpoint is that the handling time is almost always greater than with a table plus dice - admittedly in part because the other parts of the game already use dice, but that doesn't change the situation.<br/><br/>As for the separate modality roll, I don't like it aesthetically as much as I like putting them into the same table, but I think that's just a vague aesthetic issue - can't explain my preference.

Then you populate each cell of the table accordingly.<br/><br/>Let's say it's 1d6 along the top and 1d10 along the side. You roll a 4 and a 5 and you get "traces of Goblins" (or whatever).<br/><br/>Edit: adamwb already posted this very thing above! That's probably where I got the idea from.<br/><br/>One thing, though: if you're going to use things like "traces of" and lairs and what-not, you should alter your random encounter odds. Perhaps have a table that you roll on every time you enter a hex, with lots of "nothing happens" results, instead of checking for random encounters every time. Otherwise you might be cutting down the number of encounters far too low.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431335">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431335/#Comment_431335" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-20T10:33:37+00:00" title="April 20, 2014 10:33AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 20, 2014 10:36AM by Paul_T.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I fooled around with this concept a little bit and came up with this:\n<blockquote>Roll 1d10 on the table below, then roll one other die for monster/encounter type, which is a simple table you'll have which is specific to the region, just listing encounters/monsters for that area of the game world.

Anyone else have any other suggestions for the modality table? I'm happy with it as is, but you might think of something I haven't.

I'm way too lazy for all that rolling-n-referencing. Lemme walk you through how I'd do it, if you'll bare with me. <br/><br/>Firstly, this method presupposes that the players are interested in tracking monsters and knowing what's in a hex or three over - this is usually indicated by the presence or a scouting or wilderness character or two. If the players are set on using the road and getting to the next town then all this additional info is extraneous, but if they're really into the hexploration I can see it being pretty rewarding. <br/><br/>Process: I'd roll three d6s for each hex entered and for each result reading "1" I'd roll for the Monster (plus No. Appearing) then go to the a d6 Spoor table below:<br/><br/>1. You come across the Monster engaged in some likely activity (party may surprise the monster)<br/>2. The Monster is hidden nearby watching you (monster may surprise party)<br/>3. The Monster was here very recently and is currently in this hex (roll to find?)<br/>4. The Monster has been here a lot (25% of lair)<br/>5. The Monster passes through here a lot (track leads to lair 1d4 hexes away) <br/>6. Some indicator of the monster's presence in the region (uprooted trees, distant howls, flight overhead etc) <br/><br/>I'm quite pleased with this, actually. Neatly rolling up Encounters and Surprise into fewer rolls and not having any "nothing" results for on my spoor table. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431369/#Comment_431369" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-20T20:41:04+00:00" title="April 20, 2014  8:41PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 20, 2014 8:44PM by Paul_T.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike, I really like how you've folded in the circumstances of the situation into your table.

When entering a new hex, roll 3d6.<br/>2. For each "1" rolled, roll on the Encounters chart for the region to establish type of monster.<br/>3.

I've never tried using a spoor roll, so I have no idea which method would be more complicated. Experimentation is a must but my feeling is that spoor rolls add much in terms of the simulationist computation of Gygaxian naturalism but little in the way of up-front colour - not without more effort on the part of the DM. I wonder how often players might in be interested in the difference between tracks and traces and how much book keeping it'd be on the DM's part to note the difference and retain the modifying rolls for the next roll on that table. <br/><br/>My hypothetical method is only mildly faster in that, if the players do want this information, then there's a 5/6 chance of finding something that will lead them to a monster and a 1/6 or 1/3 chance of actually encountering said creature (depending on if it's aggressive or timid). Your method has a 1/10 chance of an encounter and no quick method of of relaying information to the players about what's around them other than to move into the next hex and hope that the adjustments on the table help them uncover something useful. Maybe I just want high colour: more monsters, interacting and mostly placed somewhere on the map once the players get a sniff of them. Tables have to be squeezed down into into short, impactful little information generators and, in a game run by me (the Lazy and Foolish DM), your table doesn't force me to place and justify nearly fast enough - the quicker information is out there for the players to take ownership of, the better it is for me. You want to track Ogres? Fine, just let me establish a likely location and let you guys get on with it. <br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431392">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431392/#Comment_431392" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-21T08:09:18+00:00" title="April 21, 2014  8:09AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, so far there are monsters and NPCs on the tables, as well as traces of them and chances of special prepared encounters.

As is often the case, ideally this is a hidden check, but practical reasons might make it overt.<br/><br/>If they do get lost, don't inform them; instead, roll for their actual position randomly. The distribution of possible hexes they might be in depends on the mode of travel, the hex scale, the terrain, etc., but usually involves staying in the old hex, entering the one they tried to enter, or entering one of the two mutual neighbour hexes. (Another typical scenario is one where they're trying to go to direction X, but instead progress in a random direction. Also easy to randomize.) Getting lost more may of course increase the drift later on, and the players might at some point realize that they're not where they think they are.<br/><br/>Note that there are different degrees of being lost: you can be unaware of where you are, or you might be mistaken about where you are, or you might know where you are but not how to get back to where you're supposed to be, or you might just have different degrees of uncertainty about these matters. In my play the most common type of "being lost" has involved establishing direction and distance - the party knows roughly where they are, but they might move to the wrong direction, or misestimate the distance to their target. The distance thing is also interesting and shouldn't be underestimated when handling orienteering: it can get pretty serious if the party is basing their entire logistical operation on a false premise, such as "we can make it to town before nightfall tonight" or "we have enough supplies to cross this mountain range".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432740">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432740/#Comment_432740" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-16T13:00:18+00:00" title="May 16, 2014  1:00PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting thoughts on getting lost.

It could also be an opportunity for an extra encounter check (while trying to find the right trail, you stumble into a nest of snakes). It could result in going in circles and realizing you don't know how to get out (players must then come up with a new idea about how to proceed, a different task and intent borrowing terms from Burning Wheel). In the case of being lost really putting the PCs way off track, they will certainly know that.<br/><br/>If players get lost while trying to map a wilderness area, then they will end up with an inaccurate map, though I'm a little dubious as to how appropriate this form of mapping is.

I'm going to copy-paste a discussion on getting lost; I hope you excuse all the quotes and find something interesting.<br/><br/>From the comments to <a href="http://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/94/west-marches-running-your-own" rel="nofollow">West Marches: Running Your Own</a>:\n<blockquote><b><a href="/forums/search?Search=%2318&amp;Mode=like">#18</a> ben robbins says:</b> [...] I didn\u2019t use hex maps, just free movement and distances. It kept things organic and made it easy to get lost / disoriented, which was good. To track movement I just got distances and bearings from the party (\u201cwe\u2019ll march southwest for 2 miles\u201d), checked to see if they were going the way they thought (wilderness lore) and then drew the vector on the map to see where they actually were.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><b><a href="/forums/search?Search=%2321&amp;Mode=like">#21</a> Frost says:</b> [...] The region transitions were pretty much as discrete as they are in real life. That is, sometimes it\u2019s pretty clear and (relatively) sudden: \u201cYou step out of the tree-line into the high mountains\u201d and other times it\u2019s a gradual transition: \u201cas you go further north in the forest, towards the mountains, the ground begins sloping up and gets hillier\u201d. For the gradual transitions, I\u2019m betting that Ben either called that 3 regions (forest, hilly forest, hills) or simply combined the encounter tables (probably with weighting for roughly where you are, e.g. closer to the forest is still mostly forest encounters).<br/><br/>But from the player perspective, the important thing is that there was never a point of transition, no sign (or GM) saying \u201cwelcome to the Spider Swamp\u201d. It was much more like actual exploring. And remember that we often did not know the names for an area or if we did it was more hearsay and guesswork. So usually it was more like:<br/><br/>GM: The trees start thinning out as you go west and the ground is getting wetter until you are having to carefully pick your way around mudholes and puddles.<br/>Players: Ahh I bet we\u2019re getting into that Spider Swamp that old man mentioned<br/>Player: I\u2019ll write that down on our map<br/>GM: And then maybe a bit less than mile later it turns into a swamp beach as it hits the bay.<br/>Player: Crap, that must not have been the Spider Swamp then since I think he said it was bigger and further north-east of the bay (where I thought we were).

One of the things I really enjoyed was navigating with landmarks and not always taking a the direct route (you\u2019ll get lost unless you follow the stream/cliffs/coast/ridgeline/etc!).<br/>Getting lost is also a great way to explore. Fun quote from one game:<br/>Ranger: To get there I think we need to go about an hour north, then an hour east, then an hour south, then about an hour west\u2026..<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/PatrickWR">@PatrickWR</a><br/>&gt; How important was food and water in your game?<br/><br/>We tried not to spend too much time with accounting and encumbrance, but it was definitely a factor. When heading out of town we would say how much food we were bringing and then we\u2019d keep track of the days. And if you got lost in the winter you could be in real trouble! Folks with Survival (i.e. hunting) skill were nice to have along because they helped in not getting lost and in foraging for food. As much as I normally dislike this kind of nit-picky accounting I think you need it to really get the feel of being lost (or trapped somewhere*). Best is to use very simplified accounting so it doesn\u2019t take much time itself but still allows lots of concern about food and/or water running low.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><b><a href="/forums/search?Search=%2355&amp;Mode=like">#55</a> Justin Alexander says:</b> I\u2019m curious about how the exploration was handled. This really breaks down into two queries:<br/><br/>(1) How was it handled mechanically? For example, I\u2019m seeing references here to getting lost. But if I\u2019m using the D&amp;D 3.5 rules, it\u2019s just a flat DC 15 Survival check to avoid getting lost. Obviously this could be modified, but I\u2019m wondering if you could share the details of how this was actually handled. Did you just vary the DC of the check depending on the characteristics of the area; the availability/quality of maps and directions; etc.? How often were the checks made?

One of the things that make dungeon crawls so attractive is that you\u2019re never at a loss in terms of what you should be describing: It\u2019s all on the map.<br/><br/>And beyond just describing the terrain and travel, how did you give the players meaningful choices/input into the exploration?

Failure indicates how much they deviate. Marginal failure means they know they got lost, extreme failure means they don\u2019t know. Either way you just note where they really went on your map and tell them what they see. Nothing fancy. Go look at the painfully elaborate \u201cgetting lost\u201d rules in AD&amp;D for inspiration \u2014 I\u2019m sure that\u2019s where my thinking comes from.<br/><br/><i>Typically I\u2019d just fudge these types of things, but given the \u201cDM is a mediator, not a storyteller\u201d feel of the campaign, I\u2019m hesitant to adopt that.</i><br/><br/>There is always some fudge factor, because no two situations are exactly the same (unless you want to make a massive chart with weather conditions, light, percent chance of goblin spore, blah blah blah). The point is to be fair and logical, not just abstain. An impartial referee, as it were.<br/><br/><i>And beyond just describing the terrain and travel, how did you give the players meaningful choices/input into the exploration? If they said \u201cwe go to the Frog Marshes and wander around for a bit\u201d, did you have a way of determining if they found the interesting features of the area? (And, if so, which interesting features they found.)</i><br/><br/>From my point of view \u201cwander around for a bit\u201d is an illegal instruction: as an impartial interpreter of player actions I don\u2019t know what that means. What do you mean wander? Tell me where you\u2019re going, north, south, what? If the players really do mean wander I\u2019ll just roll random directions, but that\u2019s obviously a bad plan.<br/><br/>Likewise short cuts like \u201cwe go to the Frog Marshes\u201d were also illegal (at least until the character had been along a route so many times it was boring to talk about anymore). You say you want to go to the Frog Marshes and I say you\u2019re at the gates of town, tell me what you\u2019re doing. You can say \u201cwe walk west following the hills\u201d and I say that\u2019s fine \u2014 I don\u2019t deal in long term objectives or abstract pathing, I tell you what you see in front of you. I say things like \u201cyou\u2019ve gone 4 miles and now you see the hills turning south and a forest ahead of you.\u201d The players say \u201cah, that\u2019s Wil Wood, we\u2019ve been there a dozen times already\u201d and I just shrug because there\u2019s no sign on it is there? Knowing whether it\u2019s Wil Wood is their job.<br/><br/>As I said, if a character is a seasoned veteran who has been this way a million times, sure I\u2019ll be more casual and take their experience into account, because that makes sense. If they\u2019ve seen this spot before sure I\u2019ll tell them. I\u2019ll say \u201cyeah that looks like the northern edge of Wil Wood to you.\u201d I\u2019m neutral, not a dick. But when they are in new territory they are back to square one.<br/><br/><i>did you have a way of determining if they found the interesting features of the area? (And, if so, which interesting features they found.)</i><br/><br/>Nothing fancy: if they wind up near something on the map, there\u2019s a chance they\u2019ll see it. The odds and method and reasonable distance all depend on what the thing is. Finding a castle in the plains: easy Spot at a great distance. Finding a sinkhole in a forest: much harder check at much closer distances, probably easier if you use Knowledge Nature to determine what kind of terrain would have sinkholes in it. Finding an owlbear lair: easier to use Wilderness Lore to follow the owlbear\u2019s tracks.<br/><br/>Note that for logical searching to work, the design has to be logical too.<br/><br/>If people are just wandering around instead of looking for something specific (\u201clight exploring\u201d as it was euphemistically called), they would usually find a) new regions like forests or swamps they had never seen before and b) wandering monsters. Then they\u2019d run away. Once they put those new frontiers on the map they would come back and take a closer look, maybe scouting around in the new forest they found, getting a better sense of what critters lived there and starting to get a feel for the place. Often that would give them clues of what else they could find there (if there are lots of goblins, they must live someplace). They\u2019d also try to fit it into the puzzle of the surrounding terrain (is this where the goblins came from we saw prowling around in the hills to the south?). West Marches definitely followed the Treasure Tells A Story model: you kill some goblins, but they are carrying dwarven-crafted weapons carved with symbols of a forgotten clan. Hmm, sounds like there\u2019s an abandoned dwarven lair somewhere in this region. If I was a dwarf, where would I build my stronghold?<br/><br/>Of course you could do things totally differently. Just make sure that player decisions still drive results, not random chance.<br/><br/>As I mentioned above, don\u2019t be afraid to be the GM. Make judgment calls about what rolls are needed, whatever. If it looks like the party just walked straight to the ruins, fine they did. Just be fair and impartial. What happens should make sense, not be based on ulterior motives.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432754/#Comment_432754" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-16T16:26:44+00:00" title="May 16, 2014  4:26PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Frank (and anyone else reading) - highly relevant discussion in progress here:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/19437/osr-dersu-uzala-the-ultimate-wilderness-hexcrawl" rel="nofollow">Ultimate Wilderness Hexcrawl</a></blockquote>\nI got the impression Chris was maybe directing the discussion from there to here (why have two discussions about hexcrawl techniques?).<br/><br/>Frank<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432755">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432755/#Comment_432755" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-16T17:00:14+00:00" title="May 16, 2014  5:00PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Either place, I figure.

The Dark Eye (Das Schwarze Auge) recently had a new continent added to the gaming world and the first idea was to introduce it by doing a big Hexploration campaign. The main publisher licensed it to another publisher, who had an OSR guy working on it as part of the team. But there was some argument about the creative direction and it fell back into the hands of the main publishing house. The hexploration idea vanished around that time.<br/>I actuall ran that campaign, using the map that came with it and a travel routes / points of interest system mentioned earlier in this thread. The Dark Eye maps usually are pretty gorgeous and detailled. I usually put them on the table as open information for the players. <a href="http://www.ulisses-spiele.de/download/15/" rel="nofollow">Examples for TDE Maps</a>.<br/>Looking back with the knowledge of this thread and having read the West Marsh stuff the new continent would have been a pretty good Hexploration Sandbox and probably could have been turned into a more unique experience (at least for the german market) than it was by using that concept. The way it ran it more or less was a political fishtank, where the players added new factions by making contact with them and meanwhile saw cool stuff traveling and the dangers of the jungle and rivers mattered in so far as that they made interacting with new nations and tribes and reaching points of interest have a cost but also a possible benefit.<br/>I did not roll a random table for the whole campaign I think. But tried to be simulationist in so far as to make the travel preparation and environment more than a backdrop and by having the factions on the new continent act according to their agendas. But most of the time as a GM I mostly knew what was going to happen and we all were telling a story about the main characters. Of course there were suprises but not in the way of getting inspired by the random tables and finding meaning in spots that weren't more or less special.<br/>The exploration part with the players taking of into one direction still was there and I enjoyed that. But a Hex, if it had been provided with the campaign or made by me beforehand, would have been a nice piece of technology to use.<br/>Since Fiasco I found the joy in random and semi random tables again too.<br/>I kinda wish they had done it with the Hexploration concept instead of making it a mediocre campaign with a big ship journey and village building part that seemed needlessly crunchy. (I did not use the village thing in actual play and we all were happy handwaving with the consensus of the group)<br/><br/>I do not think we really have to imagine all that much about what White Wolf would have done with the Hex. Looking at mainly Damnation City for Vampire: The Requiem and Block by Bloody Block for Hunter: The Vigil, so tail-end NWOD products, we do find many of the elements. Not random tables really, but ways to divide cities into zones the vampires can hold domain in and rules how those domains are different from each other. Examples for urban terrain and how to use it in games. What kind of encounters can happen there, what it means to be on your home turf or in someone elses. From my limited experience it comes close and I am sure with those rules an exploration campaign could be done. A group of supernatural creatures or hunters of such having to explore a new city. Finding out where the lairs of opponents are, which parts of the city are claimed by who and where to get the ressources. (Like Blood for Vampires, gateways into parallel worlds for Werewolves and Changelings.) Adding a social fishtank over it, that they can push (both Damnation City and Block by Bloody Block provide, more or less clever, mechanics for that.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432769">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432769/#Comment_432769" name="Item_97" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-17T04:28:08+00:00" title="May 17, 2014  4:28AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 17, 2014 4:28AM by Potemkin.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the sharing the maps, Biest. They're lovely but, true, they don't look very conducive to what we'd imagine as a Hexcrawl. Definitely keeping these for a rainy day. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> Was The Dark Eye your run-of-the-mill fantasy or did it have anything wild going on? <br/><br/>My feeling is that the Hexmap itself is an incredibly versatile tabletop tool and beats out standard mapping in terms of assisting the players in experiencing a wilderness. I was shocked to hear that the West Marches didn't use one. Dividing a territory out into abstracted hex-regions allows us to construct "scenes" of exploration: PCs don't actually "walk" through a Hex, they hop from one to the next exactly as a chess-piece or an edited exploration film with something exciting potentially able to happen in each hex entered. The idea that characters are actually traversing scaled-down geography is a nice thought but not really what's going on mechanically, you only infer real-time movement from the procession of discrete hex-scenes. <br/><br/>This conception of hexes is a little convoluted. Could be that I totally have it backwards, or I'm not saying anything new at all. <br/><br/>Either way, I have no problems with making players lost: if they're following a path or a landmark, then they're fine, but if they run off into the woods or otherwise loose their bearings they get informed they're Lost. Being "Lost" is a status effect (like being Poisoned or Paralysed in a JRPG) and can be quickly dispelled if a scout or party leader manages to make a save ("Oh wait, the path was just over here. Whew!"). Getting properly Lost (having this status for a while) means the PCs stop using the Hexmap proper and actually traverse a "Lost Zone" that mimics meaningful movement but actually warps them into a random hex somewhere in the region once they finally make the right saves. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> I'm a lazy DM.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432770">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432770/#Comment_432770" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-17T04:52:43+00:00" title="May 17, 2014  4:52AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike, why do hexes cause "scenes of exploration"?

I imagine the goal as a GM in such a game is to make the hexes disappear during play and only have them there to assist the players in mapping.  How different does it sound like we're thinking about this?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432771">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432771/#Comment_432771" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-17T06:30:20+00:00" title="May 17, 2014  6:30AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The hexmap is a schematic map. Each hex is a node of a specific sort representing a type of terrain in an abstracted away. Each geographic node is surrounded by other nodes and we start to build up a sense of a landscape in our imaginations that we could cross anyway we like. The alternative is moving a marker on a scale-model of a landscape (or topographical map), which is essentially the action of the video game and poorly computed by all-to-human DMs pretty much universally (hence this thread). <br/><br/>Scenes of exploration are how information is conveyed about the environment to the players. I've never seen or heard of anyone attempting to do a "real time" wilderness adventure (you inform the DM about the pace you walk and she gives minute-by-minute descriptions of how the woods change as you move through them), rather we rely on trying to find the "scene" in the hex - Encounter rolls, DM colour descriptions of the Hex Terrain-type, etc - to try make this a memorable place and an enjoyed part of the game. Usually the Scene of Exploration leaves a trace, you'll see many a map marked with evidence: "Stirge Pool," "Woodsman's Cabin," "Danger! Orc lair near here!" "Here be dragons."<br/><br/>I say promote the hex! It's a great tool! Yes, ideally all references to a game slip away and we live totally the lives of our characters, but until that happens we might as well bolster that which helps us overcome our inability to perfectly imagine an alternate world.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432773">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432773/#Comment_432773" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-17T07:13:16+00:00" title="May 17, 2014  7:13AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Dark Eye doesn't do anything too wild. It is the german market leader though. Bigger than D&amp;D ever was here. Going into it's fifth edition right now, with an ashcan release and beta test currently running. The systems is, d20 based, point buy character creation and advancement. Pretty crunchy. What might seems special is the active defense instead of a passive one like in many games. Which lead to some problems that are getting some clever solutions in the new edition.<br/>It works as an Dwarf Elf Orc setting with a medival / early modern mixture of technology level, in an age of exploration and political turmoil. You can finde the clichee regions like "These are viking like, these are swashbuckling musketeer types" but if you look further you find Glorantha, Middle Earth, Westeros levels of detail. The background world Aventuria is the main draw. With very developed history, geography and cultures.<br/>There is a whole wiki for the world as well as a Google Earth plugin for the maps.<br/>The game has had a metaplot ongoing since the late 80s with very few big retcons and no reboot. They have gotten pretty good at relating it to the players. The majority of the scenarios and campaigns out there somehow connect to that metaplot. Like finding that new continent and establishing a colony, that can be referenced later on. Or being the heros of an iconic battle or slaying some villain that has been along for years. They relate the metaplot not only in campaigns but also a magazine every two month that is part inworld newspaper. Also a yearbook at the end of every year. So multiple ways to stay involved. That style of play did not leave much of a dungeon focussed tradition, they are more an alternate mode of play that shows up once in a while. Exploration however always has come up, but never really in the hex way. A very early campaign tried something like it in the late 80s but was more or less points of interest.<br/>I did a "Game Advocates" episode for Orklord's Cannon Puncture Show about the game, which is not uploaded yet. But you can find the hangout on air we used to record it still.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19252/osr-hexcrawl-sandbox-procedures" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19252/osr-hexcrawl-sandbox-procedures" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19252/osr-hexcrawl-sandbox-procedures/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19252/osr-hexcrawl-sandbox-procedures/p3" rel="next">3</a><a class="Next" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19252/osr-hexcrawl-sandbox-procedures/p3" rel="next">\xbb</a></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F19252%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F19252%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>[OSR] Hexcrawl sandbox procedures - Page 3 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19252/osr-hexcrawl-sandbox-procedures/p3" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="[OSR] Hexcrawl sandbox procedures - Page 3" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19252/osr-hexcrawl-sandbox-procedures/p3" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="That just sounds freaking awesome, like some kind of Massively Multiplayer Table Top RPG.

You are using d20 to try and roll under. There is one attack and one parry each combat round for each combatant.<br/>The problems coming from that are that it was mathematically correct most of the time to just go all in on parrying and even if you don't it leads to many rounds where nothing but a clanking of swords happens. Even if you attack sucessfully a sucessful parry fully negates that attack.<br/>There are stunts you can do by taking a penalty on your roll. Some of them making it harder to defend. But if you fail in a roll that would make the next roll harder by how much the stunt was valued. So stunting always put you at risk, often symetrically to the opponent.<br/>The only one attack and one parry per round mean that fighting multiple opponents becomes really dangerous and deadly. Which meant many encounters had to be designed to just make it a duel for each member of the party and the party that first gained an numerical advantage was about to win. It also means that humanoid bosses without magic were prettey easy prey for a group of adventurers. Some stunts helped but never fully.<br/>The whole system works well for a fencing like style of duelling, like you know from Swashbuckler films. Which were an inspiration of the original designer. But for swinging a big axe into a horde of goblins it is not the ideal system. The setting would want both to be possible.<br/><br/>So problems.<br/>- Long fights with "empty rounds"<br/>- Shapes encounter design towards even numbers<br/>- Parry much more useful than attack<br/>- Rules and genre expectations sometimes don't match<br/><br/>In the new edition they removed the active parry from the action per turn axis in some way. You do have any number of parrys per turn, as a PC or important figure in the story, each parry after the first in the round gets a -4 penalty. So the firt opponent you defend against as usual, but his two friends you have to stop at -4 and -8.<br/>They made a difference between important characters and minions now. The important cast being able to use "Fate points" for small advantages and to have multiple parrys in one round. Minions can't do either.<br/>Making a difference of narrative importance might remove a little simulationism but leads to more statifying final fights and allows the heroes to be badasses a little more. It opens new opportunities for encounter design. With less even numbers working out better, while still keeping the core of the sytem there and allowing for the same duells.<br/>Removing the parry from the Action currency and putting it on a probabiliy currency helped there. Of course it did not yet fix the parry dominance. But I will have to test the new system a little more to see how bad it is. Or have a friend who wrote a program for that run some simulations.<br/>From what I read so far the stunts do not penalise into the next action in the new version of the system. Which makes it more of a strategically sound idea to do them, with less of a risk for the one stunting. Which should break up monotony.<br/><br/>The idea of partial sucess in attack and parry has been discussed in the feedback forums was well. Where you can manage to defend but not fully negate the attack, so that at least something might happen in the combat round.<br/>It has not yet been incorporated into the system, we will see how the tests go and if they have to consider this option or if it is working well enough.<br/><br/>Of course you have to note that in almost every group stunts were used rather frequently, for style and because the players felt that the benefit was worth the risk. There of course are other rules that play into combat, like the different weapons, rules for armor and stuff like that. Who can influence the basic system and break the parry dominance or necessitate stunting. But those aren't really part of the active defense problem.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432827/#Comment_432827" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-19T11:35:11+00:00" title="May 19, 2014 11:35AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great answer, thank you!<br/><br/>I used to play GURPS (which also has an active defense roll, which, if successful, negates the attack altogether), so this problem is fairly familiar. I've considered all the "solutions" you listed above, in various forms at one time or another; they make a lot of sense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19252/osr-hexcrawl-sandbox-procedures/p2" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19252/osr-hexcrawl-sandbox-procedures">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19252/osr-hexcrawl-sandbox-procedures/p2" rel="prev">2</a><a class="Highlight p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19252/osr-hexcrawl-sandbox-procedures/p3">3</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F19252%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F19252%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
