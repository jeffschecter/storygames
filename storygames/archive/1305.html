                    Over on his live journal, Rob Donoghue share a moment of gaming awesomeness.  While discussing it, Fred Hicks commented:
<blockquote>To get all physics on it, impact occurs when an object suddenly decelerates to a stop, with all of its momentum converting into a sudden, destructive THWAK. The same is true in gaming.<br/><br/>Impact has to come at you fast, but it also has to be based in momentum. I don't think that the story games that Rob's referencing as only addressing the first step produce enough momentum intrinsically, so if there were anything to systematize, I'd say it's that.</blockquote>
I think that momentum is an interesting way to look at narratives.  We want emotional momentum because we want that THAWK.<br/><br/>Momentum = mass x velocity<br/><br/>What would emotional mass and emotional velocity be like?<br/><br/>Emotional mass seems to be how much one cares, an investment in the character.  That is why it seems to some that the longer a game goes, the more likely or powerful these impacting moments will be.  Notice that in plays and in movies, some of the most powerful impacts are when we care or have given emotional weight to both sides of the TWACK.  You can see that in Rob's excellent actual play that the moment wasn't just him giving up his niece, but what that would do to his brother.<br/><br/>Emotional velocity then implies movement, direction, speed built up over time.  I might be obsessing, but â€œrelationshipsâ€ or â€œgoalsâ€ seem to be a good fit, but I'd love to hear other's thoughts on this.<br/><br/>After we've got one or more units of emotional momentum going, all that's left is the impact, the TWACK.  According to Newton's second law, force is equal to the change in momentum with respect to time.  As time gets smaller, the force gets bigger.  But the most noteworthy thing is that the force of the impact, the TWACK, is about the change.  One reason why hour long dramas have more impact moments than half hour sitcoms is that the hour long dramas have twice as much time to get the force going, and the fact that they allow things to change.  The sitcom has to "reset" itself 21 out of 22 episodes.<br/><br/>Whatever emotional velocity is defined as, that is the part that causes and is in turn changed by the impact.                </div>
