I have some free time next week, and I'd like to use it to help out a designer.<br/><br/>We have three people in our group, so 3-player (or GM+2 players) only.  We're all experienced gamers, and like a wide variety of games (if that makes a difference).  Anything from a rough draft to a polished beta that can be played in a 2-4 hour session would be ideal.  <b>Delivery of playtest materials no later than Jan 1st would be ideal.</b><br/><br/>If you are interested, please post the following:<br/>- A short pitch of your game<br/>- What we would need to play<br/>- What you would want out of a playtest (general feedback, answers to specific questions, am I on the right track?, etc.)<br/>The more specific you are about what you want out of the playtest, the better!<br/><br/>If anyone else has time they would like to donate to playtesting, please chime in!  Post the number of players you can handle, their experience, and how much time you can commit to playtesting!  If someone posts about a game you want to playtest, don't be afraid to call dibs. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br/><br/>P.S. I can only offer blind play-testing at this time (i.e. you send em a doc, my group plays it, we send you whatever feedback you are looking for).

It's a GM-less game that is my attempt to capture and reproduce the spirit of stories you read in fantasy novels like <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> but that you almost never get when you play "team of experts confronts challenges" RPGs or "character drama" RPGs. To play you'll need the rules PDF from the link, a bunch of polyhedral dice, and pen and paper. It usually takes 3 or 4 sessions to get the the conclusion of a story arc, so it would probably work best for a group that was willing to at least consider followup sessions if they find something they like in the first one. In an ideal world a playtest group would provide an audio recording of the session (doesn't have to be fancy, people can get pretty good audio with a smartphone in the middle of the table) as well as any personal observations or reactions that the playtesters want to offer.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401288">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RoninZombie" title="RoninZombie"><img alt="RoninZombie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RoninZombie">RoninZombie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401288/#Comment_401288" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-20T05:21:44+00:00" title="December 20, 2012  5:21AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, interested in hearing about your game!<br/><br/>Dan, Storied Age sounds really cool.

The design goal I had was to make a simple base, but that became complex in it's combinations, and most of all: I wanted to design a game that made the players discuss. It works really well and my players thought it was fun, but it needs more playtesting.<br/><br/>What you need is:<br/>- 2-5 friends<br/>- a pen to every participant, including the GM<br/>- two copies of a token for each player (initiative- and combat board)<br/>- a paper clip to each player (condition)<br/>- 2d10 per participant. (skill roll)<br/>- Around 15d6. (advantage)<br/>- 10 dimes or tokens of a similar size (tricks)<br/>- 10 red tokens (bleed)<br/>- Around 6 numbered tokens - I use dice for this (enemies)<br/>- Printed character sheets (2 per A4), enemy sheet (1 A4) and initiative- and combat board (1 A4).<br/><br/>The rulebook is now two pages long. A combat takes about 2-3 rounds (10-20 minutes - half of that time is spent on discussing).

It's about the crew of assistants hired by the kind of so-called heroes you\u2019d find in a game of high fantasy adventure, an examination of the abusive relationship between employers and employees when life and treasure are on the line.<br/><br/>In order to play Hirelings, you\u2019ll need the following:\n<ul><li>One or more players to play as one or more Hirelings<br/></li><li>One player to play as all of the mighty Heroes: a Fighter, a Cleric, a Thief, and a Wizard<br/></li><li>One player to play as the GM, controller of the explored world, its inhabitants, and even its gods<br/></li><li>Index cards (or scraps of paper) and pencils<br/></li><li>A large twenty-sided die [d20] <br/></li><li>One or more smaller six-sided dice [d6] <br/></li><li> A sense of gravitas<br/></li></ul>\nThe game is a somber affair, or it is in my head at least. I'm not even sure if it's fun, hence the need for playtesting. It also helps to have some experience with D&amp;D or OSR fantasy games, but I don't think it's required, necessarily. It's also designed to fit in a PocketMod (8 page booklet folded from one sheet of paper), so there might be some missing pieces to the rules that I've overlooked having assumed them in my head when writing.<br/><br/>So, looking to know whether it's enjoyable, whether it's approachable by those without D&amp;D experience, any rules confusion or missing pieces.
