I played with Remi, Joe and Joel last night and it was probably the best session yet, and a memorably good time in general.  This bodes well.  All of us had played the game before so things moved very quickly; I think we played the whole thing in two hours.  Here's the set-up:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/games/fiasco/cornish_creek_map.jpg"/><br/>I played Adelle, Joel played Butch, Remi played Bruce, and Joe played Timothy.  The people in italics were created in play, and the two items in green are the tilt elements that appear halfway through the game.  Everything else is situation, established at the start.  We had a pretty fun set-up:  It's 1876, a western mining town.  Butch and Bruce are working claims on Timothy's land and discover a huge hoard of Spanish silver.  They vow to keep it for themselves and not split it with Timothy.  Adelle gets wind of this (Butch isn't the sharpest tool in the shed), as does her working girl, Trixie, who Butch is sweet on and who also has a regular customer in Butch's uncle, Timothy.  To complicate matters Timothy and Adelle are old flames, and she's sworn to get even with him for ruining her.  Obviously this is all primed for disaster, which dutifully shows up, Trixie ends up dead, Butch goes bananas, Bruce tries to haul off the silver in a handcart, Timothy hires a gunfighter to come kill him, and everything goes very, very badly.  Joel played Butch as a genuine simpleton, and we were all rooting for him - and in the end, he alone emerged with a positive outcome.  Adelle - dead.  Timothy - dead.  Bruce - broken and back where he started, with a pair of smashed legs.  It was note perfect, and really fun to play.  <br/><br/>Some interesting points - it was, by and large, serious as a heart attack.  There was not much humor, which is atypical for Fiasco.  There were some fucking great scenes - after Timothy casually murdered Trixie to silence her, Adelle confronted him, and he delivered a towering ultimatum, threatening to burn down her brothel/hotel.  She responded by shooting him in the knee, and in that moment they fell back in love.  It was perfect and illustrative of both these evil, amoral characters, totally unexpected.  Later she dies, gutted like a trout by the greedy and semi-insane miner Bruce, who she had betrayed, and as she dies she begs Timothy to forgive her killer, which he does.  It was pretty cool.  <br/><br/>Playing a dead character, as it turns out, is no problem at all.  This is reassuring!  This session hit all the relationships and details squarely, also a bit unusual, but probably a result of having players who were comfortable with the system.  <br/><br/>Fiasco is ready for some external playtesting, so if you are interested, let me know.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_182301">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182301/#Comment_182301" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-09T06:10:53+00:00" title="December  9, 2008  6:10AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also worth noting - if you look at the diagram, you can see that this story was about the relationship of the Johnston family - Butch and Timothy, Nephew and Uncle.  We pegged this early and it made a lot of sense, and made the game flow better.  In the rules I talk about how the plot may not center on your guy, and identifying this early on really helps a lot.  Remi and I got to push hard on the two central guys, one of whom ended up beating the other to death with a pry-bar.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/joe%20stanton" title="joe stanton"><img alt="joe stanton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/joe%20stanton">joe stanton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182411/#Comment_182411" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-09T11:46:24+00:00" title="December  9, 2008 11:46AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hoooray! But seriously, this was a great session. It didn't feel rushed, we pushed conflict (a lot of that was built in to the relationships up top). It felt great to spend two hours trying to crush Joel's character to finally forgive him and die by his hand at the end.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_182414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182414/#Comment_182414" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-09T11:50:29+00:00" title="December  9, 2008 11:50AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's interesting how everything pointed at your guy, and that sort of made Joel the reluctant hero.  Your end was bittersweet rather than vengeful, you just sort of gave up to be with your lady-love.  Of course Joel reinforced his heroism through a little tactical play, grabbing white dice in color scenes and sort of banking them for a happy ending.  I've never seen anybody play the "I'm going to fuck over everybody by redistributing their dice for a bad outcome" game, but it'd probably be really fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tomg" title="tomg"><img alt="tomg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://tomgurg.googlepages.com/tinyrobot1.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tomg">tomg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182490/#Comment_182490" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-09T16:42:26+00:00" title="December  9, 2008  4:42PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This sounds so cool.
