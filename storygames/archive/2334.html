                    Hi, <br/><br/>I have posted <a href="http://www.headsofstate.net/?page_id=6" rel="nofollow"><b>playtest files</b></a>  of the games from my series <b>Heads of State: nine short games about tyrants</b>. The game files, plus an intro to the series, sampling of dictator facts, and tyrant/character sheet, will be available for approximately the next two months. I'm looking for any and all playtest or other feedback. <br/><br/>The nine games explore the strange, sinister world of dictators. Each game provides a different angle on tyrants and tyranny: <br/><br/>â€¢   In As I Lay Dying, the stricken Tyrant flashes back to episodes from his long, eventful life.<br/>â€¢   In Coup dâ€™ Ã‰tat, a junta of colonels vie to seize power. <br/>â€¢   In Crimes against Humanity, the international community prosecutes the defeated Tyrant. <br/>â€¢   In Disappeared, friends and family unravel the fate of a missing person.<br/>â€¢   In New Edition, party officials revise the biography of the late Tyrant.<br/>â€¢   In Palace Gates, curious citizens explore the Tyrantâ€™s residence soon after his death. <br/>â€¢   In Rest &amp; Relaxation, exiled Tyrants comment on news from home.<br/>â€¢   In Sic Semper Tyrannus, a secret conspiracy tries to assassinate the Tyrant.<br/>â€¢   In Subversive Words, a dissident writer struggles to complete a work about the Tyrant â€“ while characters from the writerâ€™s imagination act out the story.<br/><br/>The games are seperate and complete in themselves so you can play one without ever seeing any of the others. But they are also designed as a series and I encourage folks to try a couple using the same dictator so you build upon and reinterpret your tyrant.<br/><br/>All playtests to date have taken between 1 hour and 2 1/2 hours.<br/> <br/><br/>thanks<br/><br/>mark<br/><br/>www.headsofstate.net                </div>
