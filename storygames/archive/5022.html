They've had this agreement, which to my rememberance was something like, "Pay us a few hundred dollars each year, and you can put a "Compatible with the d6 system" logo on your product, and generally get mention in the places where hardcore d6 folks gathered. Now, though Eric from WEG announced that the d6 license will be free from this point on, but there are still some fine details being worked out.<br/><br/>So Jerry here's back and forth in that world, and since I've been a big fan of the system from way back in the day (I even went as far as designed a Fist of the North Star variant of the d6 system for a Japanese comic convention), and a fan of Jerry's works, I wanted to see what he thought of this move, and what it means for the future of his small press operation.<br/><br/>So Jerry, here's some directed questions I had, that I wanted to throw out there. Feel free to respond, bring up your own thoughts, etc.<br/><br/>1) What does this license mean for you and your works in particular, aside from the simple fact that you don't have to pay WEG any licensing fees. Anything that jumps out at you?<br/><br/>2) It looks like currently there is a debate over what this free d6 SRD will look like: That is, are they going to standardize the d6 license to one central attribute list and general skillset to give weight behind the modularity of the rules system, or do they leave it more freeform, up the the individual designer for attribute and skill lists, to keep the free-form-ness of the system so that it could be used for pretty much anything.  Where do you stand on that issue?<br/><br/>3) What do you think about the timeliness of the announcement? I see that in the WEG boards there seems to be a majority of people posting one of two kinds of replies: "Awesome, I've been sitting on this idea for a long time, now I'll publish it!" and "Man, if only this happened 3-6 years earlier, but I decided to go with my own system and I'm not turning back". What do you think of these responses?  Any kind of "fan response" that you particularly empathize with?<br/><br/>4) What do you think the future of The Godsend Agenda and Khepera looks like with the d6 system going "free"?<br/><br/>5) What do you think about the future of "the scene" with this move? Anything bubbling up to keep our eyes on?<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_113175">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez" title="Daniel_M_Perez"><img alt="Daniel_M_Perez" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.dmperez.com/offline/avatars/danny_avatar_03_32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez">Daniel_M_Perez</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113175/#Comment_113175" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-09T17:33:12+00:00" title="December  9, 2007  5:33PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andy, could you link this news about the d6 license going free?

My name has been invoked!<br/><br/>When I first heard that the system was going free I was really upset. I was out of the country on a working vacation and hadn\u2019t looked at my emails or the WEG site for a week. <br/><br/>Late one night I finally check the net and see the news and I felt blindsided. I wish that Eric would have sent me a heads up about what he was doing but I learned 2nd hand from a friend what was planned.  I was upset that my little special piece of the RPG market would not be mine alone for very much longer and my head steamed. I could have eaten a baby I was so upset. <br/><br/>Afterwards I thought about it and realized that this wouldn\u2019t affect me in a bad way but could actually help me out. I calmed down and looked at it again saw the possibilities it presented me. <br/><br/>1)\tIf this worked out there could be more visibility for the system, therefore more visibility for me.<br/>2)\tNew blood means new innovative ideas.<br/>3)\tNew D6 groupie chicks\u2026.You guys didn\u2019t know about the groupie chicks?<br/>4)\tMore people raising the bar means I have to step up my game and become a better designer<br/><br/><b>About the License</b><br/>The license was very easy and not a deterrent to anyone who wanted to use it. In fact the money you spend on the license is paid back to you almost immediately, or at least it was in my case.<br/><br/>The license cost $500. I looked at the fee as something that separated the casual fan from the serious publisher and not an unreasonable amount compared to some other systems I looked at. That $500 dollars would be reimbursed as long as I did at least $500 worth of advertising and promotion. Once GODSEND Agenda was ready to go I took out a few ads in Game Trade magazine, and Games Quarterly to promote the initial push. A few weeks later I got the check for $500 back from Eric.<br/><br/>I also agreed to pay a small percentage for each D6 book I sold. The amount is ridiculously small, something like .05 per book or something (I\u2019d have to go look at the contract). I\u2019ve offered to pay that fee but Eric told me not to worry about it.<br/><br/>So far I\u2019ve paid nothing for the license and received a built in market for my books.<br/><br/>A lot of people wanted Eric to do this in the past and he\u2019s resisted. I understand why he did because I\u2019m of the same mind. D20 publishers produced a lot of cool stuff from a lot of cool companies but there was also a huge glut of stuff that hurt the good D20 publishers as a whole. The $500 was meant to show that you were serious about using the license and that you had some sort of publishing plan. <br/><br/>For all intent and purposes the License is free if you plan on publishing and marketing something. Eric even implemented a license for $100 for PDF business but people balked at that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_113426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jerry%20D.%20Grayson" title="Jerry D.

Anything that jumps out at you?</b></i><br/>I\u2019m not sure yet since I haven\u2019t contacted or been contacted by Eric. Eric is fairly easy going and give the licensees a lot of freedom and leeway when it comes to what we can do with the D6 system, name, and license. My current project deviates from the standard D6 system in a lot of ways, so much so that I don\u2019t think it will be compatible with anything WEG does or anyone else.<br/><br/><i><b>2) It looks like currently there is a debate over what this free d6 SRD will look like: That is, are they going to standardize the d6 license to one central attribute list and general skillset to give weight behind the modularity of the rules system, or do they leave it more freeform, up the the individual designer for attribute and skill lists, to keep the free-form-ness of the system so that it could be used for pretty much anything. Where do you stand on that issue?</b></i><br/>I think the skill and attribute set should be codified for eas of use. Saying that, I have completely rewritten the system to fit my current project so what do I know.  <br/>I think with the free D6 license everything should have a uniformed attribute and skill set so that its recognizable from product to product Otherwise why not just create your own system and call it something else. It would only help them to have the system codified and standardized  so that different products can be used together which I assume is the lure for most of the new guys who want to use the system.<br/><br/><br/><i><b>3) What do you think about the timeliness of the announcement? I see that in the WEG boards there seems to be a majority of people posting one of two kinds of replies: "Awesome, I've been sitting on this idea for a long time, now I'll publish it!" and "Man, if only this happened 3-6 years earlier, but I decided to go with my own system and I'm not turning back". What do you think of these responses? Any kind of "fan response" that you particularly empathize with?</b></i><br/>The only thing that really pushed my button was all the guys who all of a sudden had a D6 project they were doing. When there was a fee no one seemed to want to pony up but now all of a sudden everyone has this cool thing they\u2019ve been working on. Maybe it just me being sour because I was one of the guys who broke Eric off and tried to make an honest go at it. Most of the things that people have announced look like repurposed D&amp;D campaign using the D6 system. Maybe it\u2019s the Haterade I\u2019ve been drinking\u2026.<br/><br/>There are two licensees that are working on some really cool things using the system. Final Sword production is working on a cool media licensed project that I can\u2019t mention and the other is Raven City studio who are doing a dystopian future RPG called Dreamshade. People should check these guys out, they have some cool ideas and neat plans on executing them.<br/><br/>I still think the best hope for the D6 system is WEG actually putting out product. In the last two years they have been just kinda hanging out. One good product could turn it all around for WEG making D6 the place to be.<br/><br/><i><b>4) What do you think the future of The Godsend Agenda and Khepera looks like with the d6 system going "free"?</b></i><br/>As far as the RPG publishing community goes I sit at the kids table. I\u2019m at the fringes of a lot of communities. GODSEND Agenda is more about the IP content than the cool D6 system. I don\u2019t think the system being free will diminish GODSEND. I can only hope that if there is an influx of new things published with the system that someone will take notice of what I\u2019m doing in my little corner of the sandbox. As for the future; we have another game plan for \u201908 that I hope will be as cool as I think GODSEND Agenda is. It uses a variant of the D6 system but with story game elements. I plan on calling for an open playtest at the end of the year. The idea is to learn from all the mistakes I made with GA and do this one right. I plan on putting the tens of dollars I\u2019ve made on GA into this game to make it the coolest things I\u2019ve ever produced.<br/> <br/><i><b>5)What do you think about the future of "the scene" with this move? Anything bubbling up to keep our eyes on?</b></i> <br/>At the moment I\u2019m the only active D6 publisher. I try and support the system at cons, and by publishing products. WEG has 11 D6 products in print and I have 6. If you liken WEG to WOTC, then I\u2019m Green Ronin at the moment (only because I\u2019m the only other publisher). If everyone who stated they were going to use the system now follows through I may fall from that position. But that\u2019s cool, cream rises to the top and the proof is in the pudding. I don\u2019t look at the other guys who want to use the system as competition but more like community of like minded fans who could potentially help one another out. There are a lot of creative people out there with a lot of neat ideas on how to tweak the system and make the system shine. <br/><br/>The D6 system has seen better days. I hope that this will get people looking at the system in a whole new light, maybe remembering all the fun they had with Ghost Busters and Star Wars. I hope the next D6 publisher has a SOTC to make people notice the rest of us.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_113479">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113479/#Comment_113479" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-11T06:53:21+00:00" title="December 11, 2007  6:53AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jerry D.
