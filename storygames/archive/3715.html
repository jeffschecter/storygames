When the time came for me to run it for regular group, however, and I read through the rulebook, I discovered that the game I had played in had had the rules modded fairly extensively, presumably to increase the ease 1-session convention play.  Since I wanted to run my game in one night too, I used the con rules as I remembered them.  Things went fairly well, and the book went on my shelf.  I got it out again yesterday on a whim (I had noticed how excellent TMW might be to simulate another setting which I'm enamored of in which a ragtag band of heroes and antiheroes journey to a fortress in a dormant caldera to meet their fates and slay a lord of dark magic and illusion), and reading through the text I had a number of questions:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) When a bunch of enemies attack the party, the GM is encouraged to subdivide them into individual conflicts - oni A, B &amp; C attack characters X Y  &amp; Z becomes A vs X &amp; Y alongside B &amp; C vs. Z.  Who decides how this split occurs?  The players, the GM, or both? <br/>\n<br/>\n2) can particularly strong enemies wield multiple dice?  The text doesn't seem to allow for this, but that seems a little counter-intuitive.  What's the reasoning behind restricting enemies to one die (as opposed to taking the highest of several)?<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Can Fate narration be used to win conflicts?  When I ran The Mountain Witch, the party got past the fortress gates when one player fate-narrated a l33t yakuza ninja onto the ramparts and had him kill the guard operating the gate.  I was so happy to see someone, anyone, using fate narration that I ran with it without any consideration, but how should I have handled it?  Do I veto it because its using fate to auto-win a conflict?  Do I throw in an extra conflict about getting past the gate into the scene that I might not have done otherwise?  Or was that an appropriate thing to fate-narrate?  <br/>\n<br/>\n4) Is the GM supposed to know the characters' fates before they're revealed?<br/>\n<br/>\n5) In the bestiary at the back of TMW, an option is given for the Giant to have strength "unkillable" - what does that mean?<br/>\n<br/>\n6) The book seems to imply that characters can be forced to choose between aiding a comrade and defending themselves.  How does this work, and in what situations does it occur?  If a wolf is attacking me and a tengu is attacking you, if I aid you, does the wolf automatically succeed in harming me?  What happens?<br/>\n<br/>\n7) How do players avoid conflicts to the death?  The book says that the GM needs to declare his intent to kill a PC, and that the PC can turn down the conflict, but what does this look like in play?  "The chief oni holds up his bloody cleaver and charges you.  His intent is to kill you!"  "Nah, I don't want to be in this conflict."  What do we do instead?  Is the GM required to change stakes so the conflict can continue?  Or is there some way conflict can be avoided?  If the latter, what happens?<br/>\n<br/>\n8) This is less of a rules question, but are their any good tricks for encouraging fate narration among players unused to this sort of thing?  I'd also be interested to hear examples of fate narration for some of the trickier fates, like revenge (what do you narrate for that, exactly?  The whole "witch's minion offering you what you want" can't be done for EVERY character in the party...<br/>\n<br/>\n9) What do good bangs in TMW look like, especially in the early game?  The rulebook seems to encourage"landscape bangs" like "you come to a rushing river, blocking your path" or whatever - how does one make these interesting?  There also doesn't seem to be a lot of room for friendly life on the Mountain, so beyond "witch minion sowing discord" and "something weird and cool attacks you," I've had trouble coming up with interesting encounters.  Bangs seem to translate well from game to game of TMW - is there a master list somewhere?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83515/#Comment_83515" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-26T14:04:20+00:00" title="July 26, 2007  2:04PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lots of questions!<br/>_________________<br/><br/>1) It depends on the situation. Sometimes the GM will want to purposely seperate characters to create tension to to simply make the conflict more difficult. Sometimes, players just want to do their own thing. Alot of times, I (as GM) will propose an initial situation, then see what the players want to do. After that, we finalize who's attacking who's and doing what... So I guess, it often works out as "we all decide together". <br/><br/>Do you get it, or would you like some examples?<br/><br/><br/>2) Yes and no. Generally, the rule is one enemy one die. Most people who ask about this are asking because they think monsters aren't "tough enough". But that's kinda a misperception. In practice, it's actually pretty hard to win a conflict without using Trust. And that's the point. If players are using Trust, conflicts *should* be easy. <br/><br/>Now, *occasionally* if I have a "big" enemy, I'll grant a die for different aspects of the enemy... Like, if the conflict is a snow storm, I might grant one die for the wind, one for the blinding snow, and one for the cold. But here's the deal---if you're going to do this, each die has to be treated as a seperate enemy. So if the "wind" die rolls high, the characters get blown off a cliff. If the characters "kill" the blinding snow, then the snow lightens up (though the wind and cold don't).<br/><br/>You do NOT grant an oni, for example, two generic dice and say you must defeat both to win.<br/><br/><br/>3) I don't allow a player to use Fate narration to win a conflict already in progress. But I allow them to preemptively "solve" conflicts.<br/><br/>Like, if I say, "As you approach the gate, you notice a guard." It's OK for a player to go, "suddenly a black figure jumps out of the shadows and cuts the guard's throat, before disappearing again into the shadows." However, if we're already rolling dice, and the player loses, I don't allow the player to say, "just as the guard is about to stab me, a dark figure jumps out of the shadows and stabs the guard in the back."<br/><br/>Get it?<br/><br/><br/>4) Not usually, though that's not a hard rule. <br/><br/><br/>5) It just means killing the giant isn't an option. I would still allow the giant to be "taken out", but not physically killed...<br/><br/>You know, I wrote that, but then I don't think I've ever played like that. I think I've only used the Giant once, in playtest. <br/><br/><br/>6) Technically, it doesn't quite work that way. If you aid another character, you two are "merged" rules-wise, so if you win the conflict, you won't get hurt.<br/><br/>What you should say, rather, is that players are forced to choose between helping a friend and pursuing their own interest.<br/><br/>If a tengu is about to steal the sacred mirror, at the same time your friend is being attacked by a giant spider, the players has to choose between aiding his friend and stopping the tengu.<br/><br/>Some people have complained about that (that aiding means you're more likely not to get hurt), but I think it's neccessary to acheive the other effects I want. If players *want* to help others at their own cost, they can choose an Ai-Uchi (Mutual Strike).<br/><br/><br/>7) Let's say the oni is guarding a gate that the players want to get through. It's OK for the GM to say, "If you want to get into the gate, you have to face oni, and he wants to kill you." If the players don't want to risk death, that's fine, they simply don't through the gate.<br/><br/>I've never had a player refuse a conflict, but I also try and set up situations where there's more at stake than simple injury. So if they did refuse, they would have to pay some sort of price. If you do find yourself in a situation where the only risk is injury, and they refuse... I'm not sure. I guess you could still run the conflict with just the risk of incapacitation, but I don't like doing that, it feels like the players are cheating.<br/><br/><br/>8) You can try the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/codex/index.php?title=Fishing" rel="nofollow">fishing technique (aka "<i>The Mountain Witch</i> Trick")</a> that I discuss in the book. That way, players have something to spring-off of. But this sort of thing tends to only be an issue early in the game. I've found players only have trouble when they're unsure what they want their Fate to be. Usually, even with new players, once the player figures out what they want, they immediately start jumping into narrating.<br/><br/><br/>9) "[W]itch minion sowing discord" and "something weird and cool attacks you" actually covers alot of what I do early in the game. I also just try and create situations that make the characters seem suspicious. Combined with the fishing technique, alot of drama tends to unfold organically from play.<br/><br/>Something to remember is that the GM isn't responsible for making the game interesting. The players do that. The GM just presents interesting situations. Later in the game, after players start doing Fate stuff, the GM still just builds on what they provide. This is an important shift in perspective. But once you stop trying to cling onto control of the game, you'll find it actually becomes way more interesting and easier to GM.<br/>_________________<br/><br/>How's all that? ...
