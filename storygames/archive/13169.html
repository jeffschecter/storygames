King James VI of England is dead; his son Charles has gained the Crown. Pirates from Barbary prowl the high seas. The British Empire continues to expand. You are explorers and sailors aboard the HBMS[1] Visage, one of three ships (the others being the HBMS Valiant and the HBMS Victory) sent to establish a colony in Barbados.<br/><br/>That was then. Years ago. Your ship wrecked on an unknown island after a colossal storm sent you way off course.<br/><br/>There were hundreds of you. Slaves, sailors, soldiers, explorers, and volunteers. Many tons of cargo went with you--food, clothing, equipment, weapons (including gunpowder weapons), maps, books, and building materials. All of that is spread out around this God-forsaken island, fought over by the various factions that have arisen.<br/><br/>What's the state of the failed colony now? What is the nature of the island you're on? How much of the original population has survived? Has it been long enough for a second generation? Are there natives, and if so, what is their nature?<br/><br/>Inspired by <a href="http://mightyatom.blogspot.com/2010/09/apocalypse-world-planet-athena.html" rel="nofollow">this post</a> by John Harper on The Mighty Atom. Historical fact checking very welcome.

It's a big island; big enough that the colonists have settled the shoreline but the interior remains dangerous mystery.  Seems like the slaves might have had a huge advantage, being either trained agrarians or accustomed to primitive life.  It would be neat to see them dominant in some ways.  Also, It seems more like AW if it's been quite some time -- long enough for a second generation, but the ship was probably short on women.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_296743">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296743/#Comment_296743" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-13T13:57:44+00:00" title="October 13, 2010  1:57PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Principles:<br/>-Barf forth Catholicism<br/>-Respond with buggery<br/>-Look through telescopes<br/>-Maketh your move, but never speaketh its name                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_296768">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296768/#Comment_296768" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-13T19:50:52+00:00" title="October 13, 2010  7:50PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When they open their mind to the maelstrom, will be guided to a giant statue, or a mysterious metal hatch?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
