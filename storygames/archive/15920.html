Paging Mr. Harper.<br/><br/>Personally, it seems like Act Under Fire with the 7-9 result is what running AW [and it's offspring] boil down to. The PCs do something, you complicate it, then ask 'What do you do?' ad infinitium. That's the core procedure. Everything else in the game just constrains, codifies, complicates or elaborates this basic script between the Players and the MC. <br/><br/>John is a wizard when it comes to running AW and similar; I hope he can share with us how to make this style of gaming "totally easy and not stressful."                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_361832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361832/#Comment_361832" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T14:42:48+00:00" title="February 23, 2012  2:42PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 23, 2012 2:44PM by skinnyghost.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's not that it's inherently hard as a concept.

Trying to come up with an <i>additional</i> cost is stressful! I know, because I totally tried it that way and it stressed me out and I didn't like it. So I stopped.<br/><br/>Instead, do this: When someone is doing something under fire, there's fire. Duh, right. What is it? By the time anyone is rolling this move, the concrete fictional details of the character's action and the "fire" they're acting under (or enduring) should be <i>crystal clear to everyone</i>. MC, think of it this way: <b>The fire is something bad that may come to pass.</b><br/><br/>Now, when they hit the 7-9 result, that bad thing, the fire that you have formed concretely in you mind, it doesn't come to pass the way we feared it might. A 7-9 is a hit! The PC succeeded. So, hooray!<br/><br/>But, it's not a 10+ result. The PC succeeded, but there's a cost. This doesn't have to be a brand new cost! If you're stumped and stressed for heaven's sake don't try to think of something new and exciting.<br/><br/>Just choose this cost instead: <b>The fire takes effect in a lesser way (for the PC).</b><br/>How does the lesser effect manifest? Choose one:<ul>\n<li>The thing you said was the fire happens just like you said, but its effects are weak.</li>\n<li>Look at your list of MC moves and say one.</li>\n</ul>\n"The cannibal splits you open with a swipe of his machete!"<br/>"Shit, no I get out of the way!" 7-9:<ul>\n<li>They get out of the way of the cannibal's machete! Instead of taking 3-harm they take 1-harm or 0-harm and make the harm move.<br/></li><li>They get out of the way of the cannibal's machete! But it catches their gun and rips it from their hands.<br/></li><li>They get out of the way of the cannibal's machete! But they fall backwards through a window into the river.<br/></li></ul>\nHow's that? Any stress relief?

He has a bit of a transitional moment, in a safe place, with the Angel, Grip.  Grip is out of supplies, but wants to help.  He's had some very bad luck with his Healing Touch (so far, people keep dying).  He and the Battlebabe talk a little bit and Problems decides to let Grip lay on hands.<br/><br/>Grip rolls, gets a 7-9 result.  Acts under fire from Problems' brain.  The narrative part is easy - Problems' brain is a mess of labyrnthine corridors and Grip feels more and more lost in his mind as he tries to find the place that'll let him heal his friend.  Obviously, as a 7-9, this means that the healing happens; Problem gets his segment healed.  It's just ... what's the cost?  What's the bad choice?<br/><br/>My first thought is fatigue.  That Grip emerges from the maze of Problems' mind reeling and damaged.  He'd take the harm (either Psi-harm or s-harm or something) he healed.  This was the first thing I thought and, honestly, harm-for-healing is sort of lame, right?<br/><br/>We eventually decided they'd imprint on each other, like the Hocus sex move, but this is how 7-9 on the Act Under Fire roll always goes for me - I think of something mechanically and narratively simple and either I think it's lame or my group tells me flat out "that is lame".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_361844">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361844/#Comment_361844" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T15:06:18+00:00" title="February 23, 2012  3:06PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 23, 2012 3:11PM by skinnyghost.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>This is how NOT to handle 7-9 results</blockquote>\nMy natural inclination for a 7-9 is always "yes, but" and I attach a cost, often it's Harm or Barter or social currency like "you can do it, but he will hate you forever" which in straightforward stuff like seduction and combat, isn't difficult to do and sometimes simple works.

It could almost say "something doesn't quite work out, or gets more complicated, or has funny results" -- compared to most of the other moves where the MC or player must make a choice, there is relatively little concrete guidance.<br/><br/>Also as Adam points out he games with a bunch of judgmental jerks who say snarky things from the kitchen instead of being constructive.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Though I will say that in the example Adam gives, I think part of the problem was that the fire wasn't really that straightforward -- acting under fire from somebody's labyrinthine brain is kind of a nebulous deal, at least compared to acting under fire from a withering hail of bullets or a burning building or whatever. So while I think the Harper approach of 'just like the fire, but a lesser version' is a very good fallback in general, in this case that didn't really have an obvious application (mechanically or even fictionally), because what is the lesser version of stumbling through a schizophrenic psyche?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_361851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361851/#Comment_361851" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T15:12:16+00:00" title="February 23, 2012  3:12PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 23, 2012 3:22PM by skinnyghost.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ice Cream Emperor</cite>Also as Adam points out he games with a bunch of judgmental jerks who say snarky things from the kitchen instead of being constructive.</blockquote>\nHah, I didn't quite say that - just that my players tend to hold each other to a fairly stringent standard of creative output, is all.

For NPCs: on a hit, they ask you to promise something first, and do it if you promise. On a 10+, whether you keep your promise is up to you, later. On a 7\u20139, they need some concrete assurance right now. For PCs: on a 10+, both.

It's when we get all metaphysical and weird that it starts being problematic.  I think that you can definitely roll Healing Touch without knowing what the Fire is because it doesn't always happen (this was the first time it'd come up) and you're encouraged not to know everything in advance.  I mean, all the details of the madness-maze in Problems' head came from me asking Daniel "what's it like in there" and I don't think there's anywhere that indicates where the inherent danger in being exposed to someone's open brain comes from.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_361866">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361866/#Comment_361866" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T15:27:45+00:00" title="February 23, 2012  3:27PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>You're rolling too soon.

And that's part of what we did in the aftermath.

If Grip ever tries to Healing Touch Burroughs, I already know EXACTLY what the fire is because we've seen it before.

You ask questions ("What does the inside of his mind feel like?") or disclaim authority ("How does the Fire manifest?"). You take what the fiction and mechanics have already given you and head down that road, using those methods to figure out what the Fire from some other dude's brain looks like, and then say what's happening: You're lost within his mind! OR You start crying blood! OR The other dude's brain is exposing you to the Maelstrom! And you keep saying stuff until it's clear to all the players what the Fire is.<br/><br/>I agree that it's not always easy to do in the moment, especially with demanding players who look to you for all the answers and don't assist in supplying them.  When I play, some players often say like: "The Fire is clearly X, right?" without me even having to ask questions.  But in convention games and what not, unfamiliar players often expect me to be a dancing monkey. Even then, though, if you focus on what the MC's job is and reach for tools like asking questions and disclaiming decisionmaking, it makes it much easier and helps rebalance the relationship between players and GM (which is meant to be collaborative as well as performative). Sometimes GM exhaustion makes Act Under Fire much harder than it needs to be.  In my personal experience, I have a much harder time running AW when I'm tired, since it takes some work to remember that I don't have to do everything myself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_361890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB" title="PeterBB"><img alt="PeterBB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB">PeterBB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361890/#Comment_361890" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T15:57:12+00:00" title="February 23, 2012  3:57PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 23, 2012 4:00PM by PeterBB.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ice Cream Emperor</cite><cite>Posted By: PeterBB</cite>An easy way to spice things up is to turn a boring result into a choice: say, "You're getting more and more panicked as you feel yourself being drawn deeper and deeper into the labyrinth.

Keeler might find herself hunted through the camp instead of surrounded and tied up in Dremmer's tent.<br/><br/>And the young kid sentry is invented right there in the moment --after the roll-- by the MC, which I'm saying not to do. But I'm saying not to do that because it's easier and less pressure not to, not because you can't. (An ugly choice with a kid sentry presumably makes total sense to everyone. Either it was established before when Keeler was scouting the camp, or they know Dremmer puts kids to dangerous work, or they just found out that he does. All of those are kosher.)<br/><br/>What I consider "cheating" on 7-9 outcomes or choices is when the fiction gets modified outside the scope of the events at hand in order to shoe-horn in some kind of awful failure disguised as a partial success. I've heard of MCs doing that.<br/><br/>I'm trying to pull this move out of troublesome nuances for people having trouble with it. Don't understand me to be saying how the move must work.

He wasn't a psychopath, he just drove a car with machine guns like his daddy taught him.  He'd say shit like, "Wouldn't it be nice if people would just chill out for a fucking second and allow some commerce to fucking happen?"  No one understood what he was talking about.<br/><br/>Toyota was also a driver but Toyota was an asshole.  He had a pack of children.  He drove an old rusty Toyota truck and the kids were armed with stones and bricks to throw at the other drivers on the road.  His kids were near-feral.  The first time Bullit met them he turned his back and one of them threw a rock at him and called him a fuckwad.<br/><br/>When Toyota challenged Bullit to a race, he accepted.  They were on the last stretch, the final turn before the bridge and the finish line.  <br/><br/>The roll came up 7-9.<br/><br/>"You can win but to do so you'll have to nudge the truck and over-turn it, killing damn near everyone in it."<br/><br/>"What is my other choice?"<br/><br/>"You let up on the gas and Toyota wins the race."<br/><br/>"The kids all die, huh?"<br/><br/>"Damn near all of them will die when the truck flips."<br/><br/>"I'm winning this fucking race."<br/><br/>The truck flipped and rolled into a ball on the side of the road.  Bullit went back to salvage what he could from the truck.  Toyota's youngest, a daughter, was still alive.  Bullit took her out of the wreckage and rasied her as his own.  She patrols the highways of the Hudson River Valley and sees that folks don't act like jack-asses so that commerce can go up and own the river.<br/><br/>So, yeah, anyway.  7-9.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_361902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361902/#Comment_361902" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T16:15:20+00:00" title="February 23, 2012  4:15PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dude makes a roll.

Ugly choice, hard bargain, worse outcome, they all still result in "you do it." I make the bargains and choices about something else. Like for Bullit, I might make him choose between crazy reckless driving (his own car flipping and rolling over the finish line first), or wrecking Toyota's car (killing the kids) instead. Either way, he wins the race and gets his success, which is how I fundamentally read a 7-9.<br/><br/>Also, I don't love "take backs" where a player can choose to rewind and not do it after the roll says they do.<br/><br/>These are personal preferences! AW lets us express our own MC styles and bloody fingerprints as we please.<br/><br/><i>(The gnarlier technical breakdown, just to reiterate what I said before about not rolling until you're ready:<br/>The act under fire roll here would not be "I try to win a race with Toyota." It would be all deeply involved in the moment when Toyota is trying to muscle Bullit off the road, and the finish line is looming large, and the two cars are neck and neck and the kids are about to pelt Bullit's car with bricks and I go, what do you do? And then Bullit says he mashes the gas pedal and goes for broke. So there we are, and we can make the roll and there's stuff on the line that we can all see coming -- cross your fingers holy shit.)</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_361904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361904/#Comment_361904" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T16:17:17+00:00" title="February 23, 2012  4:17PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting, I read Ugly Choice very differently.<br/><br/>Neat!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_361936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361936/#Comment_361936" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T17:21:26+00:00" title="February 23, 2012  5:21PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whoah there, people!

Hard bargains.  That's what I try for.

More detail about what the characters are doing, how they feel about it, have they done this before and if so what happened, how exactly this thing they are doing works (especially if it's supernatural/weird), etc. Y'know, if you're hesitant to say something concrete, ask a question. This gives you a minute of space, as well as ideas for what could happen, based on the fiction itself. Maybe something another player says gives you an idea you can use, or maybe not, and the detail just adds to the verisimilitude.<br/><br/>Another thing, which is a bit more pre-emptive is to cultivate apocalyptica. Don't just think up threats and disaster areas, but keep considering at various points during the game how things could go wrong for characters, what sorts of moral dilemmas they would have problems with (which is stuff you can ask them questions about), what would various NPCs think about what they are doing and how could they mess things up, etc. And then when a miss or a 7-9 comes up, you have already been thinking about this stuff and you can call on it for situations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362068/#Comment_362068" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T21:07:27+00:00" title="February 23, 2012  9:07PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">@Johnstone</a> - yeah, for sure.  When the MC has a good handle on the situation and knows to slow it down, usually it'll come before the dice hit the table.  I guess I'd forgotten, in the Grip-fixes-Problems instance, that Fire was a possibility, until after we'd hit 7-9, then I asked Daniel about what Problems' brain was like and how Grip navigated it and all that, but when it came down to the effect, I felt the need to pick something so we could all go home.  *laugh*  In the end, my attempt-and-revision actually worked out pretty well, I like the way we chose to do it.  You're absolutely right about the "let's take a second and expound on stuff / ask questions, etc" that always leads to really good stuff.<br/><br/>It's funny, because as an MC, I often over-cultivate.  I've been actively trying to leave room for other people's input into the weird so sometimes I'll leave blanks.  If you ask me what "under Fire" from the brain of any NPC might be like, I'd be able to answer right away, and often I'll have crazy custom moves for it.  It's just when there are voids (like where PCs are involved or their pasts or brains or junk), the pressure to "perform" and have a cool, thought-provoking, snowballing answer is a little more tricky.  Also really good advice in general, though.  Know the world, know the NPCs in it and then just ask a ton of questions and poke around.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_362088">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362088/#Comment_362088" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T21:40:42+00:00" title="February 23, 2012  9:40PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That example in the text sets a high bar...

I love that you are sharing your thoughts (especially John and Adam). I've been writing a 'walk-through' beginning adventure for DW, that guides the players and GM as they select moves and results based on the fiction generated, and I've found from our play that the best advice is definitely to dig a little deeper before you roll. 'Nail down the fire' indeed. This has been a great thread for seeing how y'all view / play this principle.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo much so that we've made it a house rule, almost a ritual (like gathering your dice pool in Burning Wheel) that our dice remain in their respective receptacles until we all agree on what the fire is, what a successful intent entails and what the likely result of failure might be (describe the consequences and ask). The 7-9 will through necessity lie somewhere in between and more often than not involve a hard, obvious character choice.

I wouldn't do that as the first time someone opened their brain, but if it had been established that the psychic maelstrom was particularly bloodthirsty and malevolent, then it seems totally fair game. I'd probably say, "We said those drugs would make it acting under fire to open your brain, yeah? Which means the maelstrom has a double chance to screw you over.

Heh. Okay, so it's one or the other: do you make it back into your room to ride out the trip alone or do you not freak the fuck out?"<br/><br/>Those are both fun. Either:<br/>- They're back in their room and they trip their balls off in a drug stupor for the next couple hours. Opportunities abound.<br/>- They don't freak out, and they wander the compound, tripping their balls off, but in control. Oh, the bloody fingerprints!<br/><br/>Those are both (partial) successes. In the first case, they freak out in private, presumably less vulnerable to fuckery (though being missing for a couple hours creates opportunities for others -- hey it's Apocalypse World). In the second, they're in control but out in the open while they trip out. So, what do you want? Control or privacy, pick.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362489">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362489/#Comment_362489" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-24T16:26:56+00:00" title="February 24, 2012  4:26PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Strugglers: Nobody can possibly know what you should say in that moment but you.<br/><br/>If John's excellent advice doesn't help you, here's mine: If somebody acts under fire, hits the roll with a 7-9, and there isn't a worse outcome, hard bargain, or ugly choice available - just give it to them.

The mechanics are a way of distributing outcomes generated by the fiction. You know how you get bonuses to a roll based on circumstances in a lot of games? And you don't in <em>Apocalypse World</em>? That's because the way you get bonuses is actually about what the range of outcomes it, so if you really can get yourself into a circumstance where there's no worse outcome/hard bargain/whatever?

Continuing John's example, you could also drive a hard bargain, giving them their room and no freak-out despite the trip, but now you are sorely in desperate, unthinking need to Dog Head's magic pills. You want their ability to access the mealstrom BAD. Until you sort that addiction out, you will be acting under fire as the need takes hold yeah? Also, maybe your next playbook should be a brainer?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat about flinching? They can't make it back to the safety of their room, but instead to the 'safety' of an already introduced NPC. Cybele gives her room up but at what cost? Her love and affection? Her protection. Whatever. As john suggests, the moves will snowball from here.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think part of this 'conversation' bewteen the MC and players is developing the player's skill at providing narrative descriptions that are not so binary. This allows for the story to evolve in all sorts of ways and gives a far greater creative outlet as the player can co-author far more than HIT or MISS.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15920/powered-by-apocalypse-world-act-under-fire-7-9-result" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15920/powered-by-apocalypse-world-act-under-fire-7-9-result" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15920/powered-by-apocalypse-world-act-under-fire-7-9-result/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F15920%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F15920%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
