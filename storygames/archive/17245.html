I haven't actually checked it for race among the classes though.

Junior Moppet and I played the game with one of the principals (forgetting name, sorry) and a woman and her daughter.  A two-hour game that included plenty of explanation since none of us knew jack about it going in.<br/><br/>Verdict?  It was really fun, and fun for me to play as a player alongside my daughter.  The game felt a lot like a fairy tale version of <i>Danger Patrol</i> aimed at more at kids, but adults could (and did) enjoy it as well.  It involves choosing a character type/role and a style (curious, flashy, tricky, helpful, etc.), accumulation of dice based on creative declaration of actions, danger/progress/enemy progress meters, and so on.  The components and map were clearly prototypes, but still quite beautiful and functional.  Every character has a couple of set powers and gets a special magical artifact at the start of play.  These provide unique exception-based powers keyed to the theme of your character type.<br/><br/>The roles were fun and evocative, if a little on the cute side: Lightbringer, Whizbanger, Talespinner, Sparkcaller, Riftwalker, Storm-something or other (sorry, can't remember at the moment).  They each fill a particular kind of niche, with two strong stats, two medium stats, and two weak stats.<br/><br/>The coolest component in my opinion, and the one that saw the most use by everyone, was the <i>pack</i>.  You also choose a card that represents your adventuring kit, and these are thematically organized and a bit keyed toward Styles.  I had the Mischief Kit, which included smoke bombs, cards and dice, disguise paints, and so on.  Junior Moppet chose the Daredevil Kit, so she had easy access to a glider, a landing pad, fireworks, and more.  In play, you automatically succeed in grabbing something that's pictured in the kit, but have to roll to try to pull out anything else you can imagine.  Now, you only have two pockets, so you can only pull something out twice per scene.  If you fail a roll for something not already there, you get something unexpected.  At one point, for instance, I ended up pulling out a pineapple instead of a Tesla coil.  I still managed to blow it up using Fire Magic, raining flaming pineapple doom upon the shadow creatures we were battling.<br/><br/>The character sheets have set stats or aptitudes that represent the number of dice you roll when engaging in particular actions.  Anyone can attempt anything.  I was a <i>Whizbanger</i>, a weird inventor type, so I had good Might and Think, but weak Move and Magic.  The dice reminded me of Fate dice with just + and blank sides.  You get a style die for your unique style, to be added as a bonus if you act in an appropriate way or engage in thematically matching magic.  I was <i>Flashy</i>, for example, so I got a bonus when I showed off or used Fire Magic.  Finally, there are a number of story cards that sort of reminded me of <i>Everway</i> Vision cards.<br/><br/>The setting, embodied mainly in the map--but with plenty more in the supporting material--looks really evocative and geared toward kids.  There's nothing that would stop a more adult group from giving it all a Neil Gaiman twist if desired.<br/><br/>In terms of play, we were able to get started quickly, and Junior Moppet and I grasped the operational concepts without a hitch.  The other two players weren't far behind.  It's not a steep learning curve.  In play, it's essentially about engaging in creative narration to set your tone and deploy your resources in fiction, then deciding what approach you take with your action, which  determines the stat you use as the basis of your roll.<br/><br/>As I said above, it really, really reminds me of what you'd get if <i>Danger Patrol</i> had a baby with <i>Everway,</i> which is unabashedly a Good Thing in my book.  Junior Moppet described her experience as "Awesome!  But World of Dungeons is more awesome.  But can we have the Story Realms classes in our Dungeon game?"  <i>Story Realms </i>aims at engaging kids, but I enjoyed it too.<br/><br/>Recommended if you like games like <i>Danger Patrol, Everway,</i> or <i>Seven Leagues,</i> or if you enjoy gaming with kids.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391516">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/dbrown" title="dbrown"><img alt="dbrown" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/133/nMWVBVRKLGUBK.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/dbrown">dbrown</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391516/#Comment_391516" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-26T20:20:13+00:00" title="September 26, 2012  8:20PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds amazing.

Pretty entertaining, though of course I portray a giant dork.  The other little girl is really super cute, except that her laugh was like a steel mill lunch whistle.  Endearing, but painful to be right next to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
