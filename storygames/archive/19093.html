I just picked up the game and think it's swell, but I appreciate that there is always room to build and improve. So that got me thinking: how hard would it be draw up new playbooks? I mean, between Graham's <i>Stealing Cthulhu</i>, the occupation descriptions in <i>Trail of Cthulhu</i> and the bazillion great <i>Apocalypse World</i> hacks out there that really push the limit and show what is possible, it seems to me that there is a lot of resources for figuring this out. Does anyone want to give it a shot? Or to just comment and proof what we come up with?<br/><br/>I am thinking the overall theme a <i>tremulus</i> playbook should embody is both "narrative control" and "the investigation." As <a href="http://jankcast.com/archives/2086" rel="nofollow">the Jank Cast crew has mentioned</a> (55 minutes, 47 seconds into the podcast), <i>tremulus</i> departs from <i>Apocalypse World</i> in that characters are not explicitly "in control" or powerful in that sense. Rather, as Graham suggests in <i>Stealing Cthulhu</i>, Lovecraftian protagonists are basically the vehicle that takes us on the sight-seeing tour of terrible and unspeakable realities (under the chapter "Creating Investigations"). Graham adds that to make these protagonists viable in a game, we have to make them <i>do</i> something\u2014actively work to uncover the mystery. Therefore, it is interesting to focus not on how the <i>characters</i> can control events of the game (by beating up people, overtly browbeating NPC's into doing what you want), but how <i>their players</i> can feed into the story with their paranoid speculations. It's more about narrative influence than active character empowerment (kind of like, for instance, Polaris).<br/><br/>So here is an example playbook for the Alienist. What do you think? Does it get at these two goals? Imagine that it also has the Therapy automatic move from the <i>tremulus</i> playbook and one of <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/404498#Comment_404498" rel="nofollow">Johnstone's one-liner Lore moves</a> as well. Note, I am using Bonds instead of Trust (I just find that a better game mechanic).<br/><br/>Alienist<br/>Psychoanalyst: When you have a bond with someone, tell them what you think, whether they ask you or not, and roll +passion. On a hit, they either follow your advice or <b>act under pressure</b> by ignoring your uncomfortably accurate reading. On a 10+ you also gain a bond with them. On a miss, they shut you down.<br/><br/>Let's Be Reasonable!: You can defuse any tense situation. When you interfere in threats or violence between men, roll +reason. On a 10+, choose 3. On a 7-9, choose two.<br/>\u2022 they back off and put their weapons away<br/>\u2022 they don't harm others<br/>\u2022 they don't make other demands<br/>\u2022 you don't suffer any harm in the process<br/><br/>Dream-reader: When you hypnotize a willing subject, ask them a line of questioning and roll <b>read a person</b>. In addition to the results, you get bonus hold equal to the number of bonds you have with the subject. You may also spend hold to ask the hypnotized subject up to one question from the <b>puzzle things out</b> move, accessing their suppressed knowledge or suspicions. On a 10+, you uncover a truly shocking insight\u2014announce what hypnotized subject says and gain 1 Lore (the Keeper may ask you to make a Sanity Check).<br/><br/>Licensed Practitioner: When you flash your practitioner's license, you may gain access to any mental records and sanitarium wards normally off limits to the public.<br/><br/>Criminal Profiler: When you survey the scene of a crime, apply your forensic psychology training and announce the psychological profile of the criminal, including detailing the perpetrator's likely personal history, age, habits and attitudes. Additionally, when you spend any amount of time interacting with someone with whom you do not already have a bond, you may gain a bond with them as you assemble their psychological profile.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426282">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/arscott" title="arscott"><img alt="arscott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/arscott">arscott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426282/#Comment_426282" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-26T16:24:20+00:00" title="December 26, 2013  4:24PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I remember one of the *World designers (though I don't remember which one) saying that the last place you should start an Apocalypse World hack is with the playbooks.<br/><br/>I think that's equally true when it comes to fixing Apocalypse World hacks.  Tremulus playbooks are pretty weak, but that weakness reflects more fundamental flaws in tremulus.  The Alienist is terrible because the sanity rules are terrible.  The Heir is bad because the wealth system is bad, etc.<br/><br/>The game has major problems right down to its basic moves.\xb9  Before you try to fix the playbooks, consider how to best fix the structures those playbooks are build on.<br/><br/>\xb9General Rule:  "Go Aggro" and "Seize by Force" are moves about how violence works in the apocalypse.  When a hack uses those moves unchanged, as tremulus does, that's a big red flag.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426286">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426286/#Comment_426286" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-26T18:20:00+00:00" title="December 26, 2013  6:20PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, arscott's right but that aside,<br/><br/>Psychoanalyst is okay, as long as passion isn't the manipulate stat (I don't recall, senator). Doesn't work on NPCs right?<br/><br/>With Let's Be Reasonable, does it really matter if they back down and put their weapons away if you already prevent them from causing harm? One seems like a lesser version of the other.<br/><br/>For dream-reader is it really a good idea for the player to decide what they shocking truth is? tremulus seems like the kind of game where the Keeper is supposed to decide that stuff, right? Same thing with criminal profiler. Does your game involve the players making a lot of stuff up?<br/><br/>Licensed practitioner seems like the kind of thing that would be covered by the fiction. Like, if yo say you have a license and whatnot, you have one. In theory though, being able to look up medical records anytime seems like a cooler ability than a lot of moves in the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426287">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Galadrin" title="Galadrin"><img alt="Galadrin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Galadrin">Galadrin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426287/#Comment_426287" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-26T19:49:27+00:00" title="December 26, 2013  7:49PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 26, 2013 8:29PM by Galadrin.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/arscott">@arscott</a> and Johnstone, thanks, it's awesome to have you guys on board.<br/><br/>Re: Basic structure, I definitely don't have any sacred cows, so let's do it. I thought wealth and sanity rules were OK (not mind-blowing, but decent), but if you think they could speak to a core theme more strongly, please share your vision!<br/><br/>As far as the Basic Moves\u2014definitely. Let's see\u2026 can we blow up Seize By Force (Resort to Violence) entirely? I don't think a Lovecraftian game needs a straight combat move at all. What would happen if we just chuck it entirely? If the players want to throw dynamite at a Shuggoth, they can Act Under Pressure. That way we can reduce monsters entirely to just their instincts. Lovecraft monsters should be "driven away" at best anyway, not killed outright.<br/><br/>As for Go Aggro (Threaten), who do we imagine Mythos investigators threatening? They might interrogate or try to intimidate a (human) enemy from attacking them. It kinda works for that, but might need some tweaking?<br/><br/>Re: Psychoanalyst, yep I had imagined that to be a PC thing. I like the idea of the Alienist always "shrinking heads" on the other players\u2014a Freudian psychologist and total pacifist who is nevertheless always subtly pulling strings in his relationships and secretly loves the detachment that control brings. That's my idea behind Psychoanalyst: "You know, my good Henry, that going after the pastor will not bring your dear Sarah back\u2026"<br/><br/>Re: Dream-reader, I'm actually thinking of going a different direction with that. I want the players to start contributing some of the horrible story (is that a bad idea? Is it unMythos-like?). The Keeper is the one that ultimately escalates the story of course, topping even the worst imaginations of the players (after all, players can only be expected to go so hard with their paranoid conjecture, because of their inherent self-interest).<br/><br/>And some new stuff... I'm thinking playbooks will be broadly categorized as investigators that interact best with things (objects, clues etc) and investigators that interact best with people (manipulating, influencing etc). I see the Alienist as belonging to the latter. The Author is kind of a mixed bag\u2014a jack of all trades that does a little of everything.<br/><br/><b>The Author</b><br/>Work In Progress\u2014For you, writing is both a cathartic relief from the strange investigation you have become wrapped up in as well as a method of figuring things out through your subconscious insights and intuitions. When the investigation inspires the next chapter of your work in progress, roll +passion. On 10+, hold 3. On 7-9, hold 1. On a miss, hold 1, but someone somehow finds out you are writing about them and aims to fix that (the Keeper gets a hold). For each hold you gain, explain the latest plot twist in your novel which actually relates to one of the NPC's or unsolved mysteries in the current investigation. You gain +1 forward when pursuing that line of inquiry.<br/><br/>Star Power\u2014When you explain that you are an author to someone, roll +luck. On a hit, they have heard of you and are excited to meet someone of your stature, cheerfully volunteering what information they can (or doing some other small favor) with the hope of being in your next novel. On a 7-9, they later gossip about you, making your stay in the area (and everything they know about it) a well known secret. On a miss, they don't know you and they don't like the idea that you are writing a book about them and their close-knit community\u2014you enter the rumor mill, but the gossip is less than flattering.<br/><br/>Odd Jobs\u2014You've had to work countless jobs between droughts of publishing. No matter, it has been a great source of research and first hand experience for your novels. You may choose one move from any other playbook.<br/><br/>Bookhound\u2014As a writer, you have spent more time in dusty libraries than you care to admit. When you encounter something puzzling and strange, you could have sworn that you read about it before. The next time you are in a library, roll +reason. On a miss, you spend hours poring over dusty manuals to no avail. On a hit, you find the book you had in mind. The Keeper will give the book's account of a very similar occurrence in another place and time. On a 10+, in addition to whatever clues this book reveals, you gain +1 Forward for pursuing the mysterious encounter further.<br/><br/>Author-in-Residence\u2014As per tremulous playbook.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426289">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426289/#Comment_426289" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-26T20:42:02+00:00" title="December 26, 2013  8:42PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it is fine to have the players create stuff, as long as everybody knows they are playing that kind of game.

It depends on what kind of game you want. Have you seen <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B8_Fz4m5hcoiODhVdGpOTzIxOG8/edit?pli=1" rel="nofollow">Black Stars Rise</a>? It's the Dungeon World boys writing something more like Twin Peaks and the X-Files (but without the FBI). It might give you some ideas. Or you might not like it! But it's a short read.<br/><br/>Personally, I like some noir in my Cthulhu, like Brubaker's Fatale comic. So I might like a violence move, but I don't think go aggro has any place in a horror game. So I might go with: say, act under fire, manipulate, take by force, consult the occult, assess your situation (so you have to do a noir detective monologue in order to read a sitch), and maybe read a person and maybe a search for clues move, which could be similar to open your brain or similar to the tremulus search move. And probably a sanity move of some kind, unless I decide act under fire covers that. I could also maybe add a recover move, instead of a harm move. Or, if I wanted to go really, really simple, I'd just have: do something dangerous, keep it together, manipulate, and assess your sitch. I could run an occult noir game with either setup.<br/><br/>If you ditch the violence moves, you probably want to ditch one of the stats, too, which probably means you should ditch the stat lines in the playbooks and just let players assign like a +2, +1, 0, and -1.

I thought wealth and sanity rules were OK (not mind-blowing, but decent), but if you think they could speak to a core theme more strongly, please share your vision!</blockquote>Apocalypse World is about scarcity.  It's about what you have and what you need.  The Harm &amp; Healing rules in AW really follow from that--your harm clock is a depleting resource, damage is heavily influenced by who has managed to get what equipment, and the healing rules are about how much medicine the angel is willing to spend on you when other people need it too.  Likewise, the wealth rules are a near-direct port of the scarcity-focused Barter.  I think maybe leaving a character's financial resources to the fiction and the conversation rather than codifying it in the playbooks is a solution that works well for an Ebon Eaves type environment.  Maybe an optional "Credit Rating" stat for settings where wealth is going to be more important, but I think it works better as a fixed stat than a pool of currency.<br/><br/>Sanity is, of course, the one place were the scarcity of a resource matters.  But even then, It's poorly served with a re-named version of the AW harm rules.  I have some further thoughts on that that I'll write up and post in a bit.<blockquote>As far as the Basic Moves\u2014definitely. Let's see\u2026 can we blow up Seize By Force (Resort to Violence) entirely? I don't think a Lovecraftian game needs a straight combat move at all. What would happen if we just chuck it entirely? If the players want to throw dynamite at a Shuggoth, they can Act Under Pressure. That way we can reduce monsters entirely to just their instincts. Lovecraft monsters should be "driven away" at best anyway, not killed outright.<br/><br/>As for Go Aggro (Threaten), who do we imagine Mythos investigators threatening? They might interrogate or try to intimidate a (human) enemy from attacking them. It kinda works for that, but might need some tweaking?</blockquote>I hadn't considered it before, but I like the idea of not having a core violence move at all.  The only time protagonists in Lovecraft's fiction are violent is when it's something that seems like a "playbook move"--A police inspector apprehending criminals, A farmer defending his farm with a shotgun, etc.  I think acts of desperate, possibly futile violence can be completely covered under "Act Under Pressure", while soldiers and criminals can have customized violence moves for the kind of violence they do.  I'd even get rid of "threaten" as a core move--"Go Aggro" is about how violent threats work <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/425822#Comment_425822" rel="nofollow">in a world of casual violence</a>, not how they work in a sleepy new England town.  I think "convince" can work for general threats, while a criminal playbook might have something along the lines of "an offer you can't refuse".<blockquote>Re: Psychoanalyst, yep I had imagined that to be a PC thing.

That's my idea behind Psychoanalyst: "You know, my good Henry, that going after the pastor will not bring your dear Sarah back\u2026"</blockquote>I love your conception of the alienist.  Nearly all of my Cthulhu gaming has had the characters pretty much just interact with the environment, rather than with each other.  Having a conception of how these characters might interact with each other is great.  Something to try out: what if, on a 10+, the character regains sanity if they do what you say?<blockquote>Re: Dream-reader, I'm actually thinking of going a different direction with that. I want the players to start contributing some of the horrible story (is that a bad idea? Is it unMythos-like?). The Keeper is the one that ultimately escalates the story of course, topping even the worst imaginations of the players (after all, players can only be expected to go so hard with their paranoid conjecture, because of their inherent self-interest).</blockquote>Whether the players or the Keeper is in control of the mystery is an important distinction, but the real groundbreaking aspect of these moves is that is changes the mystery from something that's planned in advance to something that's created spontaneously on the fly.  That's not necessarily a bad idea or unMythos-like.  If done correctly, I think it could be amazing.  But it does require a lot more work on the part of the players and the GM.  So if that's the route you choose, own it!  (although I will say this:  mystery generation is the one thing that tremulus does really well.  Ebon Eaves creates a planned-in-advance mystery that still incorporates significant player input.  Moves that pivot the game toward planned-on-the-fly mystery will dilute this strength somewhat)<blockquote>Re: Licensed Practitioner, fun fact\u2014the American Psychological Association had only incorporated in 1925. By the 1930's, it was definitely a new but increasingly well established institution.</blockquote>I like this move.  I like the general design of Alienist as primarily a mystery-solver rather than a healer, and this move really highlights that.  You might add some mechanical heft, like "when you search these records, poke around and take +1 forward to the roll (though, of course, "Poke around" needs some work.<blockquote>And some new stuff...

In particular, I like "Work in Progress", since there's something vaguely mystical or fated about it.  Author and Artist characters in Lovecraft's fiction were often drawn to the Mythos because of their artistic sensitivity--Edward Derby, from "The thing on the Doorstep" is a great example.  I think another move that captures the psychic connection between art &amp; the mythos would be a great addition to the Author.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426316">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426316/#Comment_426316" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-27T12:20:14+00:00" title="December 27, 2013 12:20PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the Author and Psychoanalyst's custom moves.<br/><br/>I'm generally excited about the idea of a Lovecraftian Apocalypse World hack with moves like that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426321">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426321/#Comment_426321" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-27T14:55:05+00:00" title="December 27, 2013  2:55PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah those moves have some cool flavor to it.<br/><br/>Having violence moves relate to the playbook might be a nice idea.

For now, here is a little more new stuff: the Heir. I see the Heir as another kind of funny jack of all trades type, but one solidly based in her own storyline as well as the investigation. The Heir is a risk-taker of sorts, with moves that bring her a lot of trouble as well as make her a powerful resource for the investigation.<br/><br/>In the Blood\u2014When you take a perilous path and pursue something otherworldly, gain +1 Forward.<br/><br/>Strange Nature\u2014When you receive Shock, roll +Shock. On a 10+, you receive a clue from the referee (in the form of an unspeakable insight that only you would be privy to). On a 7-9, the sight is oddly familiar and\u2026 welcoming. Reduce the Stress by one point. On a miss, someone or something takes note of you or your reaction. Average folk witnessing your shameful curiosity will be instinctively disgusted, animals will be afraid of you and otherworldly things will take special attention of you.<br/><br/>Family Unknown\u2014In each investigation, you will meet or learn about a family member distantly related or someone close to your family\u2014someone who holds another small piece of the puzzle behind your unspoken ancestry. Talk it over with the Keeper. If you make contact with them, they can be a resource for you and your work in that investigation, but they will also be eager to impart what they know of your lost lineage. When they unburden themselves of this tortuous knowledge, you might find this information more than a little unnerving (the Keeper may call for a Sanity Check, or other worrisome developments).<br/><br/>Brooding Soul\u2014Secretly, you know the answers are there, inside of you. When you push and search your unconscious mind, roll +Luck. On a 10+, the Keeper will give you an answer. On a 7-9, a creature beyond the world gains a bond with you.<br/><br/>Ancestral Home\u2014As per the <i>tremulus</i> playbook.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426347">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426347/#Comment_426347" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-28T20:42:19+00:00" title="December 28, 2013  8:42PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Those are pretty good and flavourful, although I think it's a bit weird that in Strange Nature and Brooding Soul the 7-9 results are completely different than the 10+ results. I would expect Strange Nature to be on a 7+ you get a clue, and on a 10+ you additionally reduce stress by 1. For Brooding Soul I would expect one of those two results to happen on both 7-9 and 10+ results, and the other is either a complication from the 7-9 or an extra bonus from a 10+.<br/><br/>Oh, also, in that other thread I made a joke about how the devout playbook can drive away supernatural beings, but it's the fatbeard playbook who can drive away (exorcise) mundane humans.

Aristotle called it the anagnorisis; with a nod to Raymond Chandler, we call it the \u201cbig reveal.\u201d<br/><br/>In the Pulp idiom, the big reveal is nothing more than the solution to the mystery, or finally getting to see the monster in a good light (or through a rifle scope). But in the Purist idiom, it is the moment that the main character pieces together the nature of the Mythos and goes to pieces \u2013 when Wilmarth sees the face and hands on the desk, when Thurston realizes the Cthulhu cult is still active and goes to his fate, when Olmstead realizes he has the Deep One taint, when young Danforth looks back and discerns that Poe and Alhazred were not writing fiction or mysticism.</blockquote>\nSo as far as the game goes, I think the best sanity system<br/>a) follows the narrative of something being worn away<br/>b) brings the character closer to truth, making them more powerful as it destroys them<br/>c) hits at a narratively appropriate point, not just when the character happens to see their fifth dead body<br/><br/>The Heat system used in "Hood: Big Fish in a Small Pond" is close to what I want:  Characters gain heat by doing things that attract notice of the authorities, and lose it by lying low.  Characters advance when Heat+XP reaches five, so the more heat the more quickly a character advances.  A character with 5 heat is immediately burned (out of the game), and as a move, the MC can have the character roll + heat with the potential of getting burned.<br/><br/>This satisfies b and c from my list above, but doesn't really satisfy a:  sanity isn't really something you can manage in the same way that characters in Hood manage heat.<br/><br/>The other system I was looking at was fallout from Dogs in the Vineyard.  In DitV, during a conflict, characters receive "fallout dice" depending on the type of conflict, ranging from d4s for exchanging words to d10s for exchanging bullets.  At the end of the conflict, the characters roll all the dice they've accumulated during the conflict, add the two highest, and suffer the consequences accordingly. (while rolling 1 on a conflict die gives XP)<br/><br/>When you're subjected to a shock, add a die to your shock pool based on the source:<br/><br/>Mundane: d4 (war, murder, crime)<br/>Supernatural: d6 (omens, visions, witches, cultists)<br/>Gods &amp; Monsters: d8 (ghosts, ghouls, deep ones, the Black Man)<br/>Truly Alien: d10 (shoggoths, yithians, cthulhu, Azathoth)<br/><br/>When the narrators instructs you to, roll all of the dice in your shock pool.  If any of the dice roll 1, gain an advance.  Then take the two highest dice and add them together:<br/><br/>1-7: choose one<br/> \u2022 take -1 ongoing<br/> \u2022 act under pressure to avoid freezing or fumbling<br/> \u2022 lose a point of trust with another character present<br/>8-11: choose one<br/> \u2022 faint<br/> \u2022 fight, heedless of further danger<br/> \u2022 flee, heedless of further danger<br/>12-15:gain a minor insanity, plus choose from the 1-7 list<br/>16-19:gain a major insanity, plus choose from the 8-11 list<br/>20: You go irrevocably, permanently Insane                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426397">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426397/#Comment_426397" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-31T04:24:12+00:00" title="December 31, 2013  4:24AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            IIntroducing new types of dice that will be used only ther into the system does not seem very elegant to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426399">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Coalhada" title="Coalhada"><img alt="Coalhada" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Coalhada">Coalhada</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426399/#Comment_426399" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-31T09:40:34+00:00" title="December 31, 2013  9:40AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>IIntroducing new types of dice that will be used only ther into the system does not seem very elegant to me.</blockquote>\nI tend to agree.

Thinking about the basic sanity rules, how about we divide between mundane shock (mangled bodies etc.) and supernatural/mythos realizations. So basic shock would look a lot like the regular Harm rules, maybe:<br/><br/><b>When you encounter something terrible and traumatic</b>, roll +reason to shake it off. On a hit, take -1 Forward to your next roll. On a miss, take -1 Ongoing until you find some solace (either confiding in another or in the bottom of the bottle). On any roll lower than a 10, choose one of the following:<br/><br/>~ You cry out, drawing attention to yourself.<br/>~ You lose your footing.<br/>~ You lose your grip on whatever you're holding.<br/>~ You lose track of someone or something you're attending to.<br/>~ You miss noticing something important.<br/>~ It's too much\u2014you leave the space and refuse to return there.<br/><br/>Mythos shock would use new moves entirely:<br/><br/><b>When a clue of the true nature of the universe is revealed to you</b>, gain +1 Mythos point.<br/><br/>These are sort of a blessing and a curse. Scenario-specific moves will require you to roll against +Mythos at the end of the investigation to ward off the monstrous doom that threatens to enter the world and overcome all decency and truth. Maybe you need them to understand a blasphemous tome, or to understand a riddle in the Dreamlands, or to perform a hideous rite and seal an evil from this dimension forever. Each investigation should have a unique end-move (or moves) to match its theme and feel. Since Mythos points are largely subconscious until the big reveal, they cannon be shared between investigators, and each investigator has their own pool of points.<br/><br/>+Mythos is also used to cast spells and to go insane. You can try to bleed it off earlier with coping techniques, but that is risky and in any case reduces the Mythos points that you will need to ultimately succeed.<br/><br/><b>When you try to subdue the lying madness that lurks in your subconscious</b> and you have some downtime, roll +reason to rationally reject it, +passion to accept it, +might to trust in own self-confidence, +luck to distract yourself from it or +affinity to confide in another. Subtract your Mythos points from your roll. On a miss, your condition worsens\u2014choose three from below. On a hit, choose one from below and take -1 Forward on your next roll. On a 7-9, lose 1 Mythos point as you banish the thoughts from your mind. On a 10+, you are able to delude yourself for now\u2014Lose 3 points of Mythos.<br/><br/>~ You begin to demonstrate the signs of a mental illness (or your previous illness worsens).<br/>~ Your denial opens up new subconscious vistas. Gain +1 Mythos.<br/>~ You have nagging doubts, take -1 Ongoing until you roll +Mythos again.<br/>~ Your distant and delusional manner pushes others away from you. The Keeper will choose one bond for you to forfeit.<br/><br/><b>When you are confronted directly with the lying madness and can no longer deny it</b>, roll +Mythos. On a 10+, you are devoured. The investigator is removed from play (and possibly from the world). On a 7-9, choose three from the following list. On a miss, choose two from the following list.<br/><br/>~ -1 Ongoing until you receive professional psychiatric treatment.<br/>~ You go numb with cosmic dread and any roll is treated as acting under pressure in addition to the intended move until the investigation is over.<br/>~ You black out. What you do next and what happens to you is at the Keeper's discretion.<br/>~ Otherworldly beings take note of you and enter the world.<br/>~ The truth withers you. Reduce one of your attributes to -1 permanently and gain a permanent +1 to any roll of +Mythos as you walk down the sorcerer's path.<br/>~ You go mad. Work out a relevant mental illness to the psychological damage that you have been dealt.<br/><br/>Happy New Years, everyone!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426448">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/arscott" title="arscott"><img alt="arscott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/arscott">arscott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426448/#Comment_426448" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-01T23:59:15+00:00" title="January  1, 2014 11:59PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's great.<br/><br/>But I'm still uneasy about the "subdue the madness" bit.  Not as the primary way to get rid of Mythos, anyway.  I think it works in a sort of down-time between adventures place, but I don't want to see people stop chasing the cultists and lie down for a bit because the madness is getting a bit much.<br/><br/>Thinking about it, I realize that this is what the lore moves should be.  A way to spend Mythos for effect--pushing you deeper into the conflict and the chaos instead of pulling you away from it.  Some example lore moves:<br/><br/>When you pour through a collection of ancient books, spend a point of Mythos to learn a spell, but choose one:<br/>-Blood must be spilled<br/>-A pact must be struck<br/>-The missing words must be found<br/><br/>When you kick down the door with gun drawn and interrupt sinister or otherworldly individuals, spend a point of Mythos to gain +1 ongoing for the scene<br/><br/>When you seek answers in drug-fueled visions, spend a point of Mythos to learn something important, but choose one:<br/>-You must have more of the drug<br/>-Something in the vision looked back at you<br/>-The visions show someone you care about endangered or corrupted                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426468/#Comment_426468" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-02T08:28:54+00:00" title="January  2, 2014  8:28AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><b>When you encounter something terrible and traumatic</b>, roll +reason to shake it off.

If I know there is a body in the conservatory, why would I go in and look at it? I KNOW I'm getting a -1 for it, and my next roll is probably the one to investigate the crime scene, so that will go badly too. Basically, it means actually investigating the horror stuff is gonna suck, and so discourages it. Usually, you get something when you go risking harm, here you get nothing. It doesn't matter if I'm supposed to be playing a wussy Lovecraftian victim who faints at a bad smell, if I'm supposed to be advocating for my character, then I'm going to avoid stuff if I know it's going to screw with my chances to actually do things properly. Instead, I'll go do other things so I can actually manage to do <i>something</i> properly. Except they won't be the mystery, and so they won't be fun.<br/><br/>It's a lot simpler to remove the -1s and make it just like act under fire. Everybody knows it's horror, so a roll where the benefit is you act normally when confronted by gruesome things won't go amiss.<br/><br/>Something that would actually encourage investigation might look something like this, though: On a 10+, take +1 forward as the adrenaline kicks in. On a 7-9, the GM chooses your immediate reaction (reel back, flinch, cry out, drop something, etc) but after that you're back in control. On a miss, GM's call and you don't handle it well, of course.<br/><br/>Then if I already know there's a body, of course I will go in, why wouldn't I? If I roll good enough, I'll get a bonus to the investigate roll. Sweet! And then I go in and it's a mythos crime scene and then I <i>really</i> lose my shit (because <i>that's</i> the move that really messes characters up). Whoops, got tricked by that one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Crunch" title="Crunch"><img alt="Crunch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Crunch">Crunch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426469/#Comment_426469" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-02T09:02:02+00:00" title="January  2, 2014  9:02AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The only thing I'd say is that in Lovecraftian stories having high reasoning ability isn't much of a shield against insanity.
