Eric's been a regular attender of SGBoston events for over a year now and we've had opportunities to socialize outside of gaming a fair bit.  While I now find Eric's expertise and relatively unique views on competitive play to be refreshing and challenging as a player and designer, they were initially rather surprising and didn't see to interact very positively with my own background.  But, since Eric's perspective brings up many issues for competitive / Gamist game design, I asked him if we could have a public discussion of these issues.  I'm going to start by laying some things out and hopefully Eric will step in and help clarify.<br/><br/>One of the folks who most clearly explains Eric's general approach to competitive play is David Sirlin, who summarizes the overall outlook in this article on <a href="http://www.sirlin.net/Features/feature_PlayToWinPart1.htm" rel="nofollow">Playing To Win</a>.<br/><br/>Sirlin has found that many would-be competitive players are restricted by "an intricate construct of fictitious rules that prevent him from ever truly competing."  For example, certain effective combinations of moves are often labeled "cheap," when, in reality, they are integral to the way the game is balanced / designed, such as being able to throw an opponent who is blocking in Street Fighter.  Or players might feel that it is somehow "wrong" or "unfair" to use the same effective tactic over and over again when their opponent seems unable to find a way to counter it.  Sirlin finds this ridiculous:\n<blockquote>A common call of the scrub is to cry that the kind of play in which ones tries to win at all costs is \u201cboring\u201d or \u201cnot fun.\u201d Let\u2019s consider two groups of players: a group of good players and a group of scrubs. The scrubs will play \u201cfor fun\u201d and not explore the extremities of the game. They won\u2019t find the most effective tactics and abuse them mercilessly. The good players will. The good players will find incredibly overpowering tactics and patterns. As they play the game more, they\u2019ll be forced to find counters to those tactics. The vast majority of tactics that at first appear unbeatable end up having counters, though they are often quite esoteric and difficult to discover. The counter tactic prevents the first player from doing the tactic, but the first player can then use a counter to the counter. The second player is now afraid to use his counter and he\u2019s again vulnerable to the original overpowering tactic.<br/><br/>Notice that the good players are reaching higher and higher levels of play. They found the \u201ccheap stuff\u201d and abused it. They know how to stop the cheap stuff. They know how to stop the other guy from stopping it so they can keep doing it. And as is quite common in competitive games, many new tactics will later be discovered that make the original cheap tactic look wholesome and fair. Often in fighting games, one character will have something so good it\u2019s unfair. Fine, let him have that. As time goes on, it will be discovered that other characters have even more powerful and unfair tactics. Each player will attempt to steer the game in the direction of his own advantages, much how grandmaster chess players attempt to steer opponents into situations in which their opponents are weak.</blockquote>\nSirlin discusses what high-level competitive play is like by invoking <a href="http://www.sirlin.net/Features/feature_Yomi.htm" rel="nofollow">Yomi layers</a>, where, as you go further and further up, have more and more complex interactions.<br/><br/>Yomi 1: A knew what B would do.<br/>Yomi 2: B knew that A knew what B would do.<br/>Yomi 3: A knew that B knew that A knew what B would do.<br/>Yomi 4: etc.<br/><br/>These high-level guessing games don't happen, though, if players are restricted by "imaginary" ideas about what kinds of tactics are fair game.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150052/#Comment_150052" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T09:46:25+00:00" title="June 12, 2008  9:46AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, how does this translate into roleplaying?  As Eric said yesterday:\n<blockquote>I use "gamist" as a term, but I always thought it was completely incoherent as a description of a monolithic group. Specifically, I think it was created by people who have never applied themselves sufficiently to win a serious tournament of a popular competitive game.<br/><br/>...Sirlin's notion of hardcore competitive play as a crucible of self-improvement that allows no excuses and makes no judgments other than success and failure is basically how I would like to approach every competitive game I play. I try to actually do so, but I sometimes can't due to what I perceive as bullshit social mores - and it's precisely in so-called competitive RPGs where this most often comes up, at least compared to, say, board games and video games.</blockquote>\nThe problem is that, even in most Gamist-oriented play groups, Eric can't play as hard as he wants to without seeming like an asshole, since either the game or the social contract among the players isn't built to sustain the same kind of hardcore intensity as a chess tournament or Street Fighter championship.  He's fairly adaptable and often tries to play competitive RPGs (or even more narrative roleplaying games with competitive elements) in a less intense way, but it's really grating for him and goes against his natural instincts.<br/><br/>For example, we had this recent conversation about <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>:\n<blockquote>ME: In some ways, the pure Gamism you describe is interesting to me but I'd never really think of looking for it or expecting it from an RPG. I might find it distracting from the other roleplaying aspects, unless i was playing a character who was also tactically minded.<br/><br/>ERIC:  I have a strong tendency in tactical games to internalize basic rules precepts as the actual rules of the world. For example, a dragon "ought" to do this or that in fantasy literature, but in DnD the rules tell us what dragons actually do in this world. So, the lethality or safety of combat, the likelyhood of surviving a fall, and so on - because of my play to win background, I abandon my own preconceptions and embrace what the game says about these things very quickly. Hence my confusion over what the "point" of Dogs is. The game tells you that you are God's enforcer on earth, with divine license, right? So... I believe that and go from there.<br/><br/>ME: And there's no problem with that, mechanically, you just end up with a limited picture of Dogs' range.<br/><br/>ERIC: Exactly. Dogs becomes very confusing, because I have trained myself for years to allow no tension between what I ought to do as defined by the rules and what I ought to do as a good citizen. The game always wins, save when it might conflict with the standard code of sportsmanlike conduct. Even then, the game wins if expressly constructed to trump a rule of sportsmanship. For example, Baseball allows me to plow into the catcher when running home in hopes of him dropping the ball. So I do. Unless that particular game has a game-specific rule changing that. Dogs not only allows me to shoot anyone in the face to get my way, but tells me that I have divine license to do so. Plus, it's mechanics give me strong incentives to team up with others... So, my overwhelming first impulse is to do that. After playing indie games for some time, I can hop into another paradigm without too much trouble, but it always feels awkward if the game gives strong incentives for one thing but is "about" something contrary.<br/><br/>ME: Right, but that tension is what Dogs is about. The mechanics let you shoot people, but the game's about... "So, what's worth shooting people over?"<br/><br/>ERIC: But the game's a pretend world in which I apparently have infinite divine right to do that, so, in that context, "anything." I'm a bit too good at paradigm switching for the tension to be natural.<br/><br/>ME: Right, the pretend world overrules normal paradigms. You don't have that "Omigod, you just shot someone for no good reason" thing.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150053">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150053/#Comment_150053" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T09:46:44+00:00" title="June 12, 2008  9:46AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ultimately, it's not that Eric needs overwhelming complexity in competitive games.  What he really needs is emergent complexity, so the rules could be as simple as chess or Go... or Agon, which he enjoys much more than some of the other stuff we've tried.  In fact, some games he find to be degeneratively complex, in that, if you play them too hard, the strategic complexity actually decreases, because the options get narrowed down to a few optimal ones until there's little point in playing.  You're choosing between one or two options.<br/><br/>Perhaps more fundamentally, he also needs a play contract that enables him to play the game in the manner of hardcore competitive way that he wants to and someone willing to provide tactically interesting opposition.  I can imagine Eric finding a degree of fun in seeing how quickly and thoroughly he can decimate inadequate opposition, but the high Yomi levels only happen if someone's actually willing to push back in a significant way, not just throwing some kobolds on a map and pushing them around.  That kind of "button mashing" play is only amusing for so long.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150059">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150059/#Comment_150059" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T09:50:02+00:00" title="June 12, 2008  9:50AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            NOTE: Can we avoid comments of the "clearly Eric shouldn't be playing Dogs" variety?

While I do not identify as someone as someone with a hardcore Gamist preference, the thing about emergent complexity seems to apply to nearly every sort of preferred play style.  Certainly, I want my narrative premises to be addressed through situations that emerge as the result of a number of factors.  Similarly, those that I've seen approach play from a simulation angle seems to want to see what happens when multiple elements interact, and they want the results to be both plausible and somewhat unpredictable.<br/><br/>It seems like there's a lot more thought that might be put into how to encourage emergent behaviors of different sorts, and also into how to achieve a delicate balance on the knife edge between too little and too much complexity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150066">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150066/#Comment_150066" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T10:21:05+00:00" title="June 12, 2008 10:21AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is "perhaps roleplaying games are wasted effort for him" a valid tack, then?<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm asking because it seems to me that Eric is not deriving much enjoyment from the fictional motifs present in roleplaying games. The overwhelming majority of rpgs, however, are all about the Exploration. (So much so that the Big Model makes that the definition of roleplaying, even.) And that includes gamism-supportive designs; something like D&amp;D; actually derives a majority of its fun, not from winning the GM who is playing the dragon, but actually having this imaginary character in whose guise <i>you</i> can win the dragon. But if you're not interested in the feel and issues of winning a dragon, but are just interested in having a level playing field for tactical play with no significance attached to the imaginary motifs, then it seems to me that you're just wasting effort in constructing those motifs in the first place.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I spent several days playing 4th edition D&amp;D; with my younger brother Jari just now. Jari is not a very active roleplayer, and he wasn't even interested in playing the D&amp;D; roleplaying game. He just wanted to play around with the tactical game, make some broken characters and see if the Irontooth encounter in Shadowfell is actually survivable with 5 1st level characters when the opposition is played optimally. (It seems that it's not, barring luck, by the way.) I myself, on the other hand, am only mildly amused by the tactical side of D&amp;D; - I have better games for tactical skirmish combat, what I want is the fictional challenge, not the rules-challenge. So I guess I can see what you have here with Eric, we have that sort of tension with Jari all the time when playing D&amp;D; - Jari is just playing the tactical game, while I'm myself mostly interested in the fictional challenge and the dynamic parts not served by boardgames.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy do rpgs have GMs and flexible rules? The original war-gaming answer is that the players want to engage with the fictional challenge, not the rules-challenge. If a player wants to reduce the fictional issues into nothing, though, it seems that some other form of game would serve them better. This is the case even when the player derives enjoyment from the aesthetics of the game, what boardgamers call "theme": something like <i>Descent</i> or <i>Arkham Horror</i> would serve up the same exciting fantasy/horror/whatever color that you get from rpgs, but with exact and impartial rules with no soft spots concerned with fictional realism or whatever. Thus I find that while we can fiddle with D&amp;D; together with Jari, I wouldn't recommend it to him as a fantasy skirmish game - Descent does that without requiring that annoying GM and his annoying limited-information non-codified challenges.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo frame that as a question: does Eric actively want to play roleplaying games? Is he interested in the genre of some particular game, perhaps? Or would you say that it's all same to him?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150072">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150072/#Comment_150072" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T10:34:05+00:00" title="June 12, 2008 10:34AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I also know and have played with Eric, though I don't think I've talked to him about this nearly as much as Jonathan. Um, I'm sure you'll end up reading this Eric, so feel free to correct my impressions below, but I have a response to Eero's post from my own perspective....<br><br>I just wanted to mention that Eric is totally fine playing games that have no strategic/tactical complexity to them, or that are completely mechanically transparent. For example, he's told me that he doesn't feel the kind of tension that Jonathan describes while playing Primetime Adventures, because the rules are dirt-simple and completely non-tactical. He seems to have a great time focusing on the fiction for those kinds of games, as far as I can tell.<br><br>I'll also mention a time that I played Contenders with Eric (and Malcom Craig). Contenders has a strategic element, both in the resolution of boxing matches and in how you arrange scenes for yourself. Eric ended up getting a really good end for his character, because he immediately figured out the optimal way to go about choosing scenes and managing his characters stats; I don't really care about the strategic implications of my character choices, and that, combined with some really poor card luck, drove my character right into the ground. I recall that we had a good time playing it together, but I bet we were playing in a parallel style, where we were able to appreciate and enjoy the decisions made by the other player without it impinging on the fun we were personally having. Eric may be able to tell me whether my impression in that game was correct!                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150073">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150073/#Comment_150073" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T10:37:06+00:00" title="June 12, 2008 10:37AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I realize that this is skirting perilously close to your request that we avoid it, but Dogs is deceptive. There's just enough game there to make you feel that you can game it. But none of it matters if you don't care about the fiction. The conflict rules only have bite in as much as you care about the fictional outcomes. Any player that doesn't care about the fiction can stomp all over everyone else and their fun.<br><br>I suspect that games that deliver the type of experience Eric wants must be designed with the same sort of clear focus that the early Forge innovators brought to their narrativist-supporting designs. I don't know that anyone has really done it yet, though games like Rune and Agon are probably the closest (and possibly 4e from everything I've read, though I haven't had a chance to play it yet). Ralph seems to be heading that way with Blood Red Sands, and Mike Holmes has also been talking about something like this.<br><br>That said, the question in my mind (and I don't have an answer as of yet) is how far can you go in this direction while it still makes sense for the game to be a role-playing game rather than some other type of game? My instinctual response is that a defining aspect of the role-playing game is caring about the fictional environment of play to some degree. If so, then it follows that at some point your choices in the game can (and probably should) be constrained by that fictional environment in some way.

I was really impressed by Mist-Robed Gate, because I "exploited" the hell out of the game's mechanics and the results were actually a feature rather than a detriment. <br/><br/>So, yeah, I find value in RPGs, but I want to be firing on all cylinders when I play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150076">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150076/#Comment_150076" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T10:44:20+00:00" title="June 12, 2008 10:44AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had almost the identical conversation with my buddy Dave just a couple weeks ago.

Much like in other CAs' "degenerate cases", the object of the Step On Up is not actually (a) in the fiction or (b) at the table. The player is competing principally against the structure of System itself. The parallel case for S-oriented play is the total world-oriented cause-and-effect player, who focuses solely on the fiction and wants to exclude system &amp; people-around-the-table considerations; for N, it's face-stabbiness taken to the extreme, where play is principally instrumental and addressed toward making an emotional impact on fellow players.<br/><br/>I would go so far as to say that happy Step On Up has to be addressed toward the shared content and the other players.

For example, I try to find a "move" or set of actions that I can perform repeatedly and trivially to "win." <br/><br/>Some games fall apart under this sort of analysis quite quickly - in RPGs, this most often occurs when the game is nominally about X but has a rules set that clearly tells me that doing Y is optimal. So I do Y over and over and over, with infinite patience, because I'm winning - and completely undermining X in the process. This is amusing for one or two plays, and then I find a new game. <br/><br/>Some games stand up to this analysis, and remain standing forever. This is glorious, and such a game can hold my attention indefinitely if it does anything else interesting at all.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: hamsterprophet</cite>I just wanted to mention that Eric is totally fine playing games that have no strategic/tactical complexity to them, or that are completely mechanically transparent. For example, he's told me that he doesn't feel the kind of tension that Jonathan describes while playing Primetime Adventures, because the rules are dirt-simple and completely non-tactical. He seems to have a great time focusing on the fiction for those kinds of games, as far as I can tell.</blockquote>\nTrue, but actually the rules are slightly tactical: the rules give me incentives for coming up with Edges and Contacts that are "fluffy" and intangible rather than concrete, since they are more easily applied to a situation - "Grandma's Memory" is a contact that always works, while "Bob the Arms Dealer" is tricky to use if I find myself locked in a closet on the space station. That's a feature, though, since those kinds of traits end to also be more tied to a character's personality or issues. The other tactic that's rewarded is "getting fanmail," which is the game's killer app and requires little more comment.<br/><br/>But overall, you're dead on the mark: PtA is dirt simple and I just can't break it - the few rules are completely in line with the play experience the game's trying to provide, and it flows beautifully from what the rules tell me to do to game play that produces a coherent TV show. And so I love it. I've run lots of one-shots and a whole season, and I'll run it and play it more. <br/><br/>You're also right that games that have literally no tactical complexity at all have often worked well for me, because I never have to labor under the delusion that these rules are going to stand up to being hammered on. I don't have to worry about whether the car's a lemon or not if we're walking.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: hamsterprophet</cite>'ll also mention a time that I played Contenders with Eric (and Malcom Craig). Contenders has a strategic element, both in the resolution of boxing matches and in how you arrange scenes for yourself. Eric ended up getting a really good end for his character, because he immediately figured out the optimal way to go about choosing scenes and managing his characters stats; I don't really care about the strategic implications of my character choices, and that, combined with some really poor card luck, drove my character right into the ground. I recall that we had a good time playing it together, but I bet we were playing in a parallel style, where we were able to appreciate and enjoy the decisions made by the other player without it impinging on the fun we were personally having. Eric may be able to tell me whether my impression in that game was correct!</blockquote>\nYup, I had a good time, and I think you're impression is spot-on. Contenders worked for me because charting an optimal path through the rules lead to a coherent story, so the game didn't break - like you mentioned before, there were tactical choices, but they're so transparent that I can just see them and move on, and the game has a sort of parallel solitaire thing going on that isolates our choices from each other.<br/><br/>I think that's a pretty neat feature, actually, since it lets us play our own ways and not drag each other down. One person can charge for the brass ring while the other wavers and flirts with disaster, and you can tell those stories at the same without a problem. That's hard to do if we're on a team or something and our choices get lumped together into an average.<br/><br/>I strongly suspect that Contenders would get old for me after a while, because I'd just be making the same choices every time - but that's more like how a repetitive sitcom gets old. I'm still going to enjoy watching it in the meantime.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150111">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150111/#Comment_150111" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T11:22:18+00:00" title="June 12, 2008 11:22AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite><b>Mark:</b>I agree that this sort of dysfunction doesn't seem to be described adequately by the Big Model, but I'm not sure your description matches the whole picture.

We were talking about it one day, and he described telling a story through the fight - how doing this move rather than that communicates different things to me, his opponent, via the game. He's having a kind of conversation with me. I was baffled, because I usually forget that there's another human in the room when I play. I usually forget that I'm in the room, as well, and that a room exists at all. I play to improve myself - but I desperately need him there if I'm going to do that. I'm never going to have another peak experience where I break past my own limits and become something more without a strong, skilled opponent pushing back at me. By playing hard against me, my friend gave me the chance to do something profoundly valuable to me, even if I forgot he was there while it was actually going on.<br/><br/>Paradoxically, I'm still aware of an opponent while this is going on, but it's an awareness abstracted from all the things I might normally associate with that particular person. I forget if I"m happy or annoyed with them, if they like chocolate or vanilla. But, at my best, I know whether or not they're going to do a tech-roll after a knockdown.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150117">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150117/#Comment_150117" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T11:27:41+00:00" title="June 12, 2008 11:27AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Saint&amp;Sinner</cite>I'm not sure the fiction investment is the thing since he's saying "Primetime Adventures is great"... wouldn't the system's design in BW/BE 'work' or at least be worth giving a shot?</blockquote>\nMaybe.

My instinctual response is that a defining aspect of the role-playing game is caring about the fictional environment of play to some degree. If so, then it follows that at some point your choices in the game can (and probably should) be constrained by that fictional environment in some way. I dunno.</blockquote>\nThere's a sort of hierarchy here: when what the rules support contradicts what the fiction supports, I side with the rules almost every time (I've occasionally been explicitly asked to go along with a fiction despite the rules, such as in playtests where the rules are known to be half-baked and still under heavy revision). I'm still interested in a good fiction, but I'm more interested in shedding my preconceptions and acting out of the consequences of the rules. <br/><br/>When there is no conflict, I happily add further constraints according to the fiction.<br/><br/>Games that are so arranged that I could potentially act in ignorance of the fiction, operating only based on rules incentives and support, and still contribute to the fiction coherently have my highest respect.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150123">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150123/#Comment_150123" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T11:30:30+00:00" title="June 12, 2008 11:30AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eric, can I float something by you?<br/><br/>So I was playing in this <i>Riddle of Steel</i> game set in Japan, where I was playing a heretical Buddhist nun who trained her peasant followers in stick-fighting.  And she was operating out in the boonies of the rural provinces.  But eventually she got the attention of the authorities, who sent some conscript soldiers after her, led by a moderately experienced mercenary thug, since they didn't see her as a huge threat.<br/><br/>I'm fighting conscripts and doing pretty well, right?  In TROS, the attacker declares how many dice from their limited pool they're using on an attack and reserves the rest for defending their opponent's counter-attack.  So the conscripts have 10 dice, say, and frequently attack with 6 while keeping 4.  I block with 8 of my 16 and keep the other 8 for beating the shit out of their crappy defense.  I can do this all day.<br/><br/>Then I come up against the mercenary captain.  He has 14 dice and plays a cautious defensive game, attacking with 6, keeping 8.  So I go, okay, I'll block with 8 and keep 8 still, waiting for the opportunity to get a slight wound on him that lowers his dice pool and tips the balance more my way.<br/><br/>The Auston, the GM goes, "Okay, he's a pretty decent swordsman, being a war veteran, and knows how to do things with a sword that you've never seen people do before, out here in the fields.  He's feinting.  That lets him spend his defending dice 2-for-1 to add additional attack dice, so he'll go all in and roll 10 dice to attack."<br/><br/>"Fuck," I said.  Luckily I survived that fight, but it only got worse once I got into urban areas and was fighting real samurai who knew their way around a sword.  Even when I knew about the kinds of things they could do and could consider those possibilities when preparing attacks, I couldn't do all those moves myself, not with a stick.  And, sure, I had some tricks with the stick that most samurai weren't used to dealing with, but they were samurai and could usually make up for it in other ways (armor, swords that cut people's limbs off).<br/><br/>Would that kind of game, where all of the tactics weren't known to players at the beginning, where you played beginning characters with relatively little combat knowledge, but gradually learned new techniques over the course of play, would that be more likely to sustain your interest, since the optimal tactics would keep shifting as you gained more information and abilities?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150131">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150131/#Comment_150131" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T11:42:44+00:00" title="June 12, 2008 11:42AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 12, 2008 11:44AM by Moreno R..">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems to me that the issue is the "breakability" of systems.  Tactical subsystems inside a rpg attract you, and you try to "break" them. Then you have (for example):<br/><br/>PTA: little tactical choices, that don't distract much from the rest of the game, are Ok.<br/>Contenders: tactical choices have a bigger piece of the pie, but they are "in line" with the premise. Until you find and optimal strategy (and are bored by it) the game work for you.<br/>DitV: much of the game is based on the tension between character effectiveness and player morality (and investment in the integrity of the game fiction). The conflict subsystem encourage violence and escalations, that contrast with the player's morality. It's a completely different interaction than the one in Contenders.  In DitV the thematic element is based on that contrast inside every character, in Contenders the contrast is BETWEEN characters: if you are very good at "playing the game" in DitV you should horrify yourself, in Contenders you should be a tough adversity to the other characters.<br/><br/>I would be curious to know if you have ever played My life with master, In a Wicked age, Sorcerer or Carry. If I did get the root of the issue right, you should have no problem (from that specific element, I don't know about others) with MLWM and Sorcerer, and be really at odd with IAWA and Carry (both of which have the tactical sub-elements at odds with the premise, and are subject to breakableness)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150143">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150143/#Comment_150143" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T12:05:41+00:00" title="June 12, 2008 12:05PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 12, 2008 12:07PM by Eric.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>Eric, can I float something by you?...<br/><br/>Would that kind of game, where all of the tactics weren't known to players at the beginning, where you played beginning characters with relatively little combat knowledge, but gradually learned new techniques over the course of play, would that be more likely to sustain your interest, since the optimal tactics would keep shifting as you gained more information and abilities?</blockquote>\nThat sort of setup has the potential to be awesome or lame, depending. Let me break it down a bit:<br/><br/>1) Fairness. One of the core ethos of competitive play is a level playing field, and it's important that escalations in the power of my opponents not feel like a simple act of revenge or retaliation against my own skill. It's completely fine if the game gets harder or my opponents get tougher, but it's best if I clearly understand how that's happening and why. In the scenario you've described, I think I can understand a basic progression of opposition from the boonies to the capital, and that works pretty well. I think we've all heard horror stories of teleporting super-ninjas that drop in to beat up the players whenever the GM gets annoyed, though.<br/><br/>2) "Fake" complexity. There's a big difference between rules that add genuine tactical or strategic depth and rules that just change one mathematical equation to another. In the scenario you describe, I can pretty quickly derive an optimal offensive or defensive dice setup when fighting that veteran. Adding feint... just changes the calculation. Just making the same option better or bigger doesn't add depth, it just makes me write multiple versions of the equations I have in my head.<br/><br/>Teleportation changes both the tactical and strategic landscape of DnD 3.X profoundly. Buffs that add +4 to a stat... don't. <br/><br/>3) "Fake" difficulty. As with fake complexity, fake difficulty doesn't add any real challenge to how I think about the game. If the Guards of the High Tower are twice as tough as regular guards, then I can just get twice as tough myself before fighting them, then proceed as before. If I've already "solved" the regular guards with a clever ploy that makes me win every time with no risk to myself, the Guards of the High Tower aren't going to fare any better just by having bigger numbers. <br/><br/>Real difficulty might force me to deal with a new complication that has a powerful impact on the tactical landscape, for example, that close new doors and open others. That's a lot harder to do than just changing numbers.<br/><br/>If you can avoid these pitfalls, then yes, that could seriously rock. It might come off a lot like, say, Magic: the Gathering, where new mechanics are regularly introduced that have a profound impact on play.<br/><br/>There are a number of considerations beyond this, but those are the ones that I regularly see derail games for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150144/#Comment_150144" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T12:12:38+00:00" title="June 12, 2008 12:12PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a cool thread.

But there are dozens of other cases in which playing the "game" of a particular RPG actually moves people further away from what the game is about, without much internal tension to pull players back, and I think this operates to the detriment of these RPGs and the play that results from them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150155/#Comment_150155" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T12:28:31+00:00" title="June 12, 2008 12:28PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Totally agreed, and some (many?)

I also won't do it willingly in Agon, since I'm trying to maximize my glory and getting into fights that I won't win is a bad way to do that. "Getting into trouble" has mechanical weight and corresponding incentives and penalties.<br/><br/>In contrast, I'll do it all the time in PtA, because character risk in PtA - mechanically speaking - is <i>completely fake</i>. I've had marvelous luck when running PtA for people new to storygames by pointing this out: you <i>can't lose PtA</i> in the way you can lose lots of other games. The risk might have narrative weight, but your character isn't going to arbitrarily die or turn to the dark side or whatever because you opened a chest without searching it first or dived headlong into a pack of stormtroopers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150265">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/T-Boy" title="T-Boy"><img alt="T-Boy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/T-Boy">T-Boy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150265/#Comment_150265" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T18:28:14+00:00" title="June 12, 2008  6:28PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 12, 2008 6:29PM by T-Boy.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jono</cite>Can I just say, this thread shows exactly why I love this forum?

So, let's assume everyone at the table knows that and does it. This is kind of like optimal build order in Real-Time Strategy games: there are just right and wrong ways to build. Sure, sometimes you're rushing and sometimes you're booming, but within that plan you do some things and not others.<br/><br/>Okay, we all know that, and now we fight. Contenders has an asymmetric-payoff paper-rock-scissors game at the core of the fighting mechanics, and that's one of the most robust competitive designs ever created. It's a pure Yomi game with actual strategic depth, and those stay interesting so long as my opponent and I continuously adapt to each other.<br/><br/>So, I'd say the "real" Contenders game, from a hardcore perspective, looks a lot like an RTS: people decide to boom or rush or whatever (one of these might be just better, so this might be a fake choice), go through their "build order," and then you get to the "actually playing" bit of asymmetric-payoff rock-paper-scissors. So long as everyone is building their characters at about the same rate, this stays interesting.<br/><br/>This might suffer from slippery slope, though - just like in most RTS games! - where an early loss basically hoses you for the next 3 hours of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150270">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150270/#Comment_150270" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T18:42:54+00:00" title="June 12, 2008  6:42PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 12, 2008 6:45PM by Eric.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: T-Boy</cite>I give credit to Johnathan for that, actually.

We had some rather awkward bits in our play at SGBoston early on, but he's always been interested in discussing with me what he's after in gaming and curious about what I'm after. We're both just generally interested in exploring other cultural perspectives, as well, be they distant or local.<br/><br/>One thing to keep in mind about Sirlin's disciples, though: this has a real religious character to it. Not religious as in a cult of personality, but in that the experiences that you can get by playing this way can been deeply transformative, even transcendental. I have had things akin to religious experiences during tournament play, where time seemed to stop and reality unfolded for me in stunning new clarity. It's hard to brush up against that and not be passionate about it, and this naturally tends to lead to shouting when you put it on the internet.<br/><br/>Of course, some people also just like saying "I'm right, and this authority guy says so!" really loudly and often.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150273/#Comment_150273" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T19:00:04+00:00" title="June 12, 2008  7:00PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The shortest path.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>Is "perhaps roleplaying games are wasted effort for him" a valid tack, then?<br/><br/>I'm asking because it seems to me that Eric is not deriving much enjoyment from the fictional motifs present in roleplaying games. The overwhelming majority of rpgs, however, are all about the Exploration. (So much so that the Big Model makes that the definition of roleplaying, even.) And that includes gamism-supportive designs; something like D&amp;D actually derives a majority of its fun, not from winning the GM who is playing the dragon, but actually having this imaginary character in whose guise<em>you</em>can win the dragon. <br/>*snip*<br/>To frame that as a question: does Eric actively want to play roleplaying games? Is he interested in the genre of some particular game, perhaps? Or would you say that it's all same to him?</blockquote>\nI think you've confused your own motives for being the only possible ones. It's not about winning in the guise of some character, it's that that guise is an obstacle itself, just like the dragon is obstacle. There is no interest in guise or genre for its own sake, there is interest only in the sort of massive obstacles they present. Just like a cliff face is obstacle to a climber, the GM's imagination - how he imagines the dragon, how he imagines your guise, is an obstacle. That's why gamist players often don't add to their characters guise - they are only interested in how the GM imagines it. And how to beat that. To add to the guise would be a stupid move.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150274/#Comment_150274" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T19:05:33+00:00" title="June 12, 2008  7:05PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 12, 2008 7:08PM by Eric.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thor Olavsrud</cite><cite>Posted By: Saint&amp;Sinner</cite>I'm not sure the fiction investment is the thing since he's saying "Primetime Adventures is great"... wouldn't the system's design in BW/BE 'work' or at least be worth giving a shot?</blockquote>\nMaybe. It's hard to say. There's a lot of tactical meat in the games, but the pumping heart--the cycle between Beliefs, Instincts, Traits and Artha--is all driven by investment in the fiction.<br/><br/>Also, many parts of the game, especially Advancement, push you to make suboptimal choices.<br/><br/>Some tactically minded players love it. Some hate it.<br/>I've played BW once, actually, just an introductory adventure - "The Sword." Before talking a bit about it, though, I need to introduce someone else: my wife, April.<br/><br/>April shares my hardcore "play to win" mindset. She's a bit more entrenched in the mindset, to the point that she has a hard time understanding why certain creative agenda sub-schools are even vaguely fun, but she also knows she's entrenched, so she freely grants that this might be fun to somebody else even if it baffles her.<br/><br/>If I break games on my own, April and I are a wrecking ball together. Many games, for example, rely on all-versus-all PvP elements in their theme or premise while giving strong mechanical incentive for cooperation. For example, the Order of the Stick board game assumes that players want to stab each other, but has a completely unbalancing reward for teaming up.<br/><br/>So, you're playing this with a table of four. If you go lone-wolf, you can expect to have about a one in four chance of winning. If you team up, you can <i>utterly crush</i> not only every other player, but all the game-generated opposition. There's still only one winner, but this simultaneously increases your individual odds of winning from 25% to 50% - Richard's strategy in season one of Survivor is based on this same insight.<br/><br/>So guess what we do?<br/><br/>Back to Burning Wheel. So, there's this Sword. My dude's sheet says that I'm supposed to get it, and this is, in fact, a defining life goal and my society totally supports getting it by any means. April's sheet defines her as basically in it for money - she wants to sell the thing or something, I dunno. So, we're in the cave or whatever, time to argue. I ask the other players, with Elf characters if I remember right (I was a dwarf, or maybe it was the reverse) if there's anything in the world that we can possibly negotiate that will end up with me taking the sword back home with me.<br/><br/>They say "no."<br/><br/>This is now super-easy from my perspective, and April's. We have non-conflicting agendas, so I immediately offer to pay her in compensation for the sword, she accepts, and the stabbing starts.<br/><br/>45 minutes after "game on!" we had basically finished the adventure, and were genuinely puzzled to find another group was still in the cave arguing over the sword. April and I were also kind of curious as to what the whole point of the affair was supposed to be.<br/> <br/>That's my entire experience with Burning Wheel. The game told me I was apparently supposed to do X, I promptly did so,  April did the same, and it kind of fell flat.<br/><br/>I caution that this is a single short experience, and the fellow running it was rather unfamiliar with the system himself, so I can only comment on the game in a very narrow context.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150279/#Comment_150279" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T19:26:48+00:00" title="June 12, 2008  7:26PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>Definitely, and the competitive bits of<i>Geiger Counter</i>, which are based on cooperative board games like<i>Betrayal at House on the Hill</i>and<i>Lord of the Rings</i>, have definitely benefited from Eric playtesting.</blockquote>\nLike, for example, I did a rigorous analysis of the game's old Dog's-inspired dice system that proved that, in that incarnation, Jason finds it basically impossible to kill the cheerleader.

The player is competing principally against the structure of System itself. The parallel case for S-oriented play is the total world-oriented cause-and-effect player, who focuses solely on the fiction and wants to exclude system &amp; people-around-the-table considerations; for N, it's face-stabbiness taken to the extreme, where play is principally instrumental and addressed toward making an emotional impact on fellow players.<br/><br/>I would go so far as to say that happy Step On Up has to be addressed toward the shared content and the other players.

Hey, don't look at me that way, I didn't take offense at the hardcore adjective, and the term 'scrub' is pretty clinically defined by the article.<br/><br/>I think Ron Edwards may have simply been wrong. What his article calls hardcore gamism is just plain, vanilla gamism. While what he defined as gamism is scrub-gamism. Probably the damning evidence of that is that gentleman 'hardcore' gamers can agree on adhering to a certain condition. I'm sure if you challenged Sirlin to a SF match with no throws, he would consider the challenge gracefully. While scrub gamers don't feel they need to ask for an agreement - they just say throwing is cheap, for example. Such rules are fictitious in that they are not actually agreed on.

She just got done running the "Whispers of the Vampire's Blade" Eberron adventure for me, and the genre agreement was "James Bond." Specifically, Roger Moore-era goofy Bond, like <i>Moonraker</i>. <br/><br/>She limits herself to providing opposition that makes sense in that sort of Bond movie, with the additional limiter of using only the oppositional resources provided explicitly by the adventure (this allows fairness by strictly defining what "pieces" she has on her side), while I limit myself to using Bond-appropriate solutions.<br/><br/>Of course, it's not immediately obvious what's in-genre when you port Bond to a world governed by DnD rules, so we allow the option of discussing what might or might not be in-color. Also note that we're playing to win as hard as we can within these confines.<br/><br/>It works wonderfully. As usual, I did all kinds of stuff that the module writer neither expected nor planned for. I won when I used clever methods to find the eponymous Vampire's coffin while on a train - I wasn't "supposed" to be able to, but the game's bullshit cockblocking failed to account for a few attack vectors, and author's intent is irrelevant once the game starts. I then... tied it shut and sealed it, and brought it back to Sharn for the reward. <br/><br/>I'm not sure if that's actually Bond-ish, but Bond's solution to a lot of stuff is pretty out-there. <br/><br/>Anyway, April and I both had a grand time. Note that my victory occurred with zero risk to myself - it was impossible for the Vampire to get to me while I was sealing the coffin before I could make it into the sunlight. That makes the victory more awesome to us, not less. Winning with a sheathed blade is superior to overpowering the enemy in a heated fight. <br/><br/>So, yeah, April and I and every serious tournament player I've known are totally willing to make agreements up-front and official-like before the game. But the rules are a sacred thing to us once the game starts, and they must be inviolate for us to really have this sort of fun.<br/><br/>**Extra note regarding staying in-genre: we can't use genre to force shitty tactical options onto each other. If April wants to do X, and X isn't Bond-esque, I can talk about modifying color, but under no circumstances can I change the substantial tactical nature of what she was going to do. This goes both ways. So, we both do our best to stay in-genre as a gentleman's-and-gentlewoman's agreement, and we largely do it well, but there's no veto on either side for what's properly in-genre.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150287">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150287/#Comment_150287" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T19:50:22+00:00" title="June 12, 2008  7:50PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 12, 2008 7:52PM by Callan_S.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Eric,<br/><br/>One surprise thing I found about Dogs in the vineyard is that there is no god. The divine right to kill is simply superstition.<br/><br/>You might want to consider narrativism as super extended yomi. Eg<br/><br/>"Okay, I kill you cause I can and want your stuff. But then someone else is stronger than me and decides they can use the same principle to kill me. But I don't want to die...so, perhaps I enslave them and take their stuff. Wait, then someone stronger does that to me. Okay, I become their king and tax them. Wait, someone might topple me. Okay, perhaps I start a democratic government, where I can use shady backroom deals to get their resources...'<br/><br/>You can see I just raced through several million years of human cultural development. All of it bouncing between what the opponent, other men, will do. I've skipped alot of the complexity. Narrativism might be simulating being trapped in this very thought process - of never being able to escape the yomi. There is no end to the game, where one strategy proves supreme. The game goes on forever, and so too does the yomi's dance.<br/><br/>Why play a game to enter into a madness that never ends? Because it is our mortal lot in real life - to play nar is a method of stepping back from the madness and trying to make sense. Narrativism is a layer of yomi in real life. That it imagines the moves of imaginary men means little when those imaginary men are drawn from real life experience.<br/><br/>Eh, that's my glib description. Whether dogs in the vineyard meets the requirements of such an activity, I have no actual play experience to test it by. Also I use alot of moving, emotional words.

It's a reference to Sun Tzu, who was extremely antagonistic towards the notion of "actually fighting." From a strategic standpoint, if you're in a position where you're opponent can do something to you that you actually care about - forcing you to draw your blade - you've already messed up.<br/><br/>In this sense, the whole notion of "Step On Up" is completely crazy. The whole point of playing to win is to try to win perfectly, without any chance of defeat. If you need someone to hit a home-run in the bottom of the ninth, simply being in that situation in the first place constitutes a failure on the part of the team as a whole. The scouts didn't deliver good information, the statisticians didn't make accurate predictions, the coaches didn't mold the team properly, the offense didn't produce, and the defense wasn't tight enough.<br/><br/>Of course, as you're trying to do this, the other team's trying the same thing. But at no point does a competent head coach of any professional team ever actually want to be in a situation where they desperately need a cluch play to save the game. It'll make headlines, sure, and the press will laud you - but a 10-run blowout would have been vastly safer.<br/><br/>There's a specific baseball example that I really like to illustrate this. During game 2 of the 2007 World Series (this is baseball, for those of you who aren't required by law or local custom to follow such things), in the eighth inning, the Red Sox relief pitcher Jon Papelbon caught the Rockies Matt Holliday leading off of first, intending to steal, and managed to throw him out. That sounds impressive - a dramatic race between pitcher and runner - except it totally wasn't.<br/><br/>The Red Sox knew days before the game that Holliday would try to steal, because a scout or statistician on the Red Sox had made a point of including it in his report: Holliday is very likely to steal late in the game under certain conditions. The situation met those conditions.<br/><br/>The drama here is completely fake. Holliday was out the moment his team fell behind in the intelligence and counter-intelligence arms race - they were destroyed in the yomi game before the "real" game even started, since they didn't know that the Red Sox knew. <br/><br/>This is winning with your sword still sheathed: Papelbon is fast and skilled, but you don't need to be that fast or skilled if you know beforehand what the runner is going to do. It was a no-risk, huge-reward move, and it's <i>that</i> level of skill that I admire the most.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150298">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150298/#Comment_150298" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T21:08:14+00:00" title="June 12, 2008  9:08PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 12, 2008 9:13PM by Eric.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd like to toss a question out here, actually, for anyone who wants to weigh in: is Monopoly a functional game? Jonathan and I have discussed this briefly, and I'll post a bit of relevant chatlog on the topic: \n<blockquote>JONATHAN: ...because games don't have to be perfect systems to be functional, especially if you consider them more like literature and less like computer \tprograms. There's definitely a focus on creating complex mechanical systems in some forms of design, but because they are manipulated by people who can make choices, rather than machines that execute them, you also have \tsocial mechanisms that can be relied on.<br/><br/>ME: \tHmm... do you consider Monopoly to be a functional game? I don't. I think many people do, though, so this might be a point of differentiation.<br/><br/>JONATHAN: Yeah, I do. I think it depends on how you view games. I view games as a way of structuring enjoyable social interaction.</blockquote>\nSo, I don't think Monopoly is functional because there's only one viable strategy. Playing it is thus just a distraction from my perspective, a meaningless exercise in dice rolling and non-choices. It is functional from Jonathan's perspective, since it structures social interaction in a fun way for him. As Jonathan mentioned above, I'm also very interested in social interactions as part of gaming, but this interest doesn't cover what Monopoly provides.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150303">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150303/#Comment_150303" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T21:38:21+00:00" title="June 12, 2008  9:38PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would say its functional, even if there is only one viable strategy (i'm not sure I agree with you on this, besides in the sense of buying property and building things but that's the point of the game not the strategy in it) because there is always the possibility of you not being able to impliment the one true way better/faster/stronger than others. Monopoly might be dysfunctional if you did A, then B, then C = profit=win but i've never been able to do that. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the comment about exploration above, does exploration of the rules not count. God knows I've done more than a little stuff in rpg's for the fact that somebody put these rules in here, so I thought i would try them out.

terms only make sense in the context of serious competition. If the activity is non-competitive, it's meaningless, and if the activity is deliberately and openly non-serious (like most drinking games), it's meaningless. There's a lot of value judgment tied in with "scrub," judgment which Sirlin himself tries to avoid by repeatedly pointing out that the whole notion of hardcore competitive play is a pretty niche thing.<br/><br/>So, yeah, I've been really happy about being able to address these issues despite the minority status of my playstyle around SGBoston and, I would assume, on these forums. I want to keep that up, and thus I want to really make sure that I'm not conveying any sense of value judgment about people who don't approach games the way I do. I appreciate greatly the lack of the corollary judgment towards me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150312">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150312/#Comment_150312" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T23:25:17+00:00" title="June 12, 2008 11:25PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've always said there's a huge continuum of competitive play, and this thread is pointing out a lot of different directions that continuum extends.<br/><br/>If I shoot hoops with my dad at the park, we are competitive.<br/><br/>If I sign up for a city league, that is competitive.<br/><br/>But the word means very different things in the same game in very different situations.

I love being right! :-)<br/><br/>I am not so hardcore playing rpgs, but I played chess in tournament, I know what Eric is talking about, about being passionate about winning, excluding any distraction from that single, pure objective. And I always had some problems with rpgs that worked only if you did some sub-optimal choices only to make the game work (it was the principal point of my old critique of Carry, for example). (Interestingly, DitV doesn't have this effect on me because in that case you do sub-optimal choices because you care for the people of the city, it's not "only to make the game work". ).  <br/><br/>But, at the end, If I want to play thematic games, there will be a point of tension, a place and a moment where I will have to choose between engaging the premise or doing the optimal strategic choice, even in the ones that avoid that problem in the rules. These two objectives can't co-exist at the same time.<br/><br/>interestingly, I have seen that, not these two objectives, but two (or more) people with these different objectives, can co-exist in the same game. I have seen this more often in LARPS, and from the actual play I have read it can happen in Contenders. What happen in these cases is that, "playing to win" without caring too much for the premise (for morality, for love, for friendship, for what the game is talking about) the "gamist" players become opposition, "the bad guys", and push the intensity and drama of "the story" up a notch. And, at the end, usually the "hardcore gamist" win the game, and the people who played for the story get a very dramatic story (that usually end with the gamists' characters killing them and destroying everything they hold dear...  ;-) <br/><br/>(I think Vincent wanted a similar effect in IAWA, but it's not exactly the same one: in IAWA you can't really play hardcore gamist with that conflict system, you would break the group consensus in five seconds, top. Even I have to reign my gamistic tendencies when I play it...)<br/><br/>Jonathan, this can describe what happened the times Eric enjoyed playing a narrativist game (as Contenders), or I am going in a wrong direction?.<br/><br/>To get this effect, I think that what it's needed it' a rock-solid game system underneath that can be played hardcore gamist without breaking, and a game that allow playing these kind of characters. But I have too little personal experience in these kind of situations to go too far in describing them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150327">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150327/#Comment_150327" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T00:59:39+00:00" title="June 13, 2008 12:59AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 13, 2008 1:03AM by Callan_S.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eric: Yeah, I see what you mean by the red sox winning before the moment occured. Kind of not my fave, because it's almost 'play before play'. It's kind of why I hate making characters and especially equiping them before play. I'd rather go in and lose cause I didn't buy 20 feet of rope than spend an hour browsing gear lists and trying to buy my way out of every challenge I can guess. Sure, next time I'll buy 20 feet of rope during char gen, but I prefer to suffer my lessons at the moment of play. I wonder if that's scrubby of me, to not want to optimise before the game starts? (edit: No - I prefer not to draw my sword, so to speak, until play begins - and even then, not at all if possible). Anyway, the red sox example is still good since I imagine the rest of the game would still involve 'at that moment' tests of skill. I mean, that's what you turn up to see. Those moments! The scouting in the background is interesting, but by its nature is hidden. That's good for the team, but not much use for me as an observer until the facts come to light.\n<blockquote>In this sense, the whole notion of "Step On Up" is completely crazy. The whole point of playing to win is to try to win perfectly, without any chance of defeat.</blockquote>\nAre you refering to the forge essays? I thought 'step on up' did refer to trying to win perfectly, with no chance of failing (specifically, having the guts to try and win perfectly, even though in situations like the first try of a game, for example, that's often impossible). Then again, I may have missunderstood it (see my post to Moreno)<br/><br/>On monopoly, yeah, I don't see it as much of a game either. I see it as a high handling time version of snakes and ladders. Not that I don't like an occasional game of snakes and ladders, even though it's pure gamble. But the extra handling time monopoly adds is just a waste of time. I like my pure gamble hard and fast!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Moreno:\n<blockquote>And I always had some problems with rpgs that worked only if you did some sub-optimal choices only to make the game work</blockquote>\nThe worst thing? I think for a long time I've thought people I played with had, through a series of non verbal cues, asked me if I wanted to keep to certain sub optimal choices. Ala the gentlemans gamist agreement (Like Erics "Bond" example). But I think I was just deluded - they weren't asking me to take on a difficult challenge, it was just doing it that way for the sake of doing it in just that particular way. Shesh. I thought I had had an understanding with them.<br/><br/>Eric might be interested in this too: In terms of gamist mechanics, I always thought capped resource choices were a fairly strong, basic way of taking an imagined space and making it tangible. For example, say an encounter has from 1, up to 3 goblins. A GM decides how many. Now this could take into account all sorts of imagined action - the players might describe their sneaking and sniping, or how they would try to intimidate the gobo's, or poison their food. In the end, at worst, three goblins might turn up. If your description hits the nail on the head, two or perhaps even just one.<br/><br/>But most RPG's seem to have to leave it completely open either way - either as many goblins as the GM sees fit, or worse, no opportunity of risk at all. That last one is how simulationists often sucker gamist players, I think. Gamists do aim to win with no risk of defeat. So when they get through without a scratch, wow, a win!

I've been mulling a lot of <cite>IAWA</cite> tactics in my head, and I can already see that the game has a fantastic tactical depth. The risks are always high, and the values are always shifting. The only places where you can run into problems are letting the dice drift away from the story ("I stab you in the face! I'll be rolling Covertly and With Love.") and letting the Best Interests become boring. If I can resolve both of my character's Best Interests and the other Best Interests directed against me exclusively by exhausting and injuring others, there could be a problem. Otherwise, I'll still have to engage the story in tandem with my system-level tactics.<br/><br/>(I'm not sure if Vincent has clarified who narrates a character's exit from the game from injury of exhaustion. If it's the injured, then this isn't as much of a problem. If my best interest is to kill you, I will still have to negotiate your death, otherwise you can live on--very badly injured, but still mocking me.)<br/><br/>And because there's so much negotiation, violations of social understanding of the group (I'm not saying "social contract" because I don't entirely think it's appropriate in this case) is to an extent wrapped into the tactics. The stick only goes so far; if I piss someone off too much, I can damage negotiations. Pushing too hard too early can get players to value certain aspects of the story more highly, to the point where I say, "No, you know what, I'd rather die than marry you. So if you're going to stab me through the heart, get on with it and face up to the fact that you'll never be able to meet your Best Interest of our wedding." Layers upon layers.<br/><br/>What's more, <cite>IAWA</cite>'s "win conditions" (such as they are) are very malleable. Entering a game with tragic or self-destructive goals has been loads of fun for me. If a player is still going at the game too hard Vincent's advice about <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=26103.0" rel="nofollow">not creating driven characters</a> should provide some new interest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tablesaw" title="Tablesaw"><img alt="Tablesaw" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tablesaw">Tablesaw</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150386/#Comment_150386" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T06:26:34+00:00" title="June 13, 2008  6:26AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eric</cite>So, I don't think Monopoly is functional because there's only one viable strategy. Playing it is thus just a distraction from my perspective, a meaningless exercise in dice rolling and non-choices. It is functional from Jonathan's perspective, since it structures social interaction in a fun way for him. As Jonathan mentioned above, I'm also very interested in social interactions as part of gaming, but this interest doesn't cover what Monopoly provides.</blockquote>I don't much like <cite>Monopoly</cite> myself, but I did once do some reading on tournament play. As I understand it, the main challenge in Monopoly is to mitigate the risk of uncertainty that the game holds. The other aspect of Monopoly is correctly determining the value of everything on the board, which randomness also effects. You need this to know how to correctly negotiate between players and how to decide whether to auction properties and what price to pay. <br/><br/>The only real exciting part of Monopoly is the middle game, when players have amassed a collection of properties and they need to negotiate with each other to move forward. Before that, the options are too limited, other than auctions which develop asymmetrical values. After that, you've got a few players waiting to see who lands where and what rents and fees will decide victory. But in the middle, even when all players understand the relative values of the properties, it's pretty interesting.<br/><br/>So I'd say it's functional for what it is. It's certainly a good simulation of real-estate development, where fate is a greater enemy than rival developers. Of course, most house rules completely destroy the game. I was well into my teens before I ever knew that the auction rule even existed, which explained why the games I'd been playing went on so long. And the infusion of cash from "Free Parking" keeps the pressure off of mortgaging and negotiating.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150399">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150399/#Comment_150399" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T06:46:34+00:00" title="June 13, 2008  6:46AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I withdraw my objections.

"play nice". Even if that "nice" is narrating the beheading of their characters, you must do it in a way that they find acceptable.<br/><br/>"playing to win" REQUIRE getting the most you can get, skirting the rules, going on the edge. If nobody at the table goes "whaaaaaaat????" when I narrate what happen, it mean that I didn't go as far as I could.<br/><br/>But this is not the thread to talk about IAWA, I cited it only as an example.

Only one person can actually get it. <br/><br/>April's character (the Roden?) wants the sword for money. As far as we recall, nobody at all has the money to pay her off. So, holding out for a bag of money is pointless. That option is irrational, so April ignores it.**<br/><br/>My character offers money for the sword. There are three ways to interpret this offer:<br/><br/>1) I'm lying: I can't pay her now, and I won't pay her later.<br/>2) I'm telling the truth: I can pay her now, and her belief that nobody in the room can pay her is false (unlikely).<br/>3) I'm asking for credit: I cannot pay her now, but I'll pay her later<br/><br/>If it's 2) or 3), she's golden.

Of course, this is symmetric - I might do the same to her - but that's all moot unless she manages to get to a 2-left-standing scenario.<br/><br/>So, the simple fact that I'm willing to team up and <i>might</i> be able to align our goals makes teaming up with me a superior choice to staying a lone wolf.<br/><br/>Epilogue: I didn't survive the fight!

So, the Bond game looks Simmy to the extent that the rules (the gentleman's agreement) incentivized that, but we were hammering each other with the rules to make that happen. <br/><br/>My character could engage in cinematic horseback battles, for example, because I CharOp'ed to make them good at it. Car chases and automotive combat happen in Bond as a matter of course, and Bond's good at it, so I make sure I'm good at it to the greatest extent practicable under the rules.

See, personally, I don't think I compete differently in those two situations (mind you, this is self-diagnosis!).<br/><br/>Two weeks ago we played <i>House on Haunted Hill</i> at SGBoston - a very low-key and easy going setting. I asked April if she could recall whether I had my game face on while taking my turns, and she told me that I did - the same game face that I have on when I'm playing for money. <br/><br/>I try to apply myself to the greatest extent possible when playing competitive games - but that's a very internal thing. I'm trying to bring all my faculties to bear on the task at hand and really understand what I'm looking at and what's going on.<br/><br/>I have the sense that different levels of competition are often associated with other factors beyond how hard you try - emotional investment in winning, maybe? Emotional relationship to the competition? I've always been rather unclear as to what makes casual play casual beyond "don't use your best character" - and I still play as hard as I can with my lousy character. I only really stop when, for example, I stop competing and enter teaching mode ("...okay, I'm going to jump at you and kick. Try to hit me out of the air.

I mean, maybe I could come up with something that I could treat as a win or loss condition, but the rules certainly don't have anything like that in them.<br/><br/>If there's no winning or losing (on a macro or micro level!), then there's no true competitive aspect in the sense that I've been talking about. So, those parts of my brain just kind of never turn on. I understand that some people actually do see PtA as a kind of competition to impress the table, measured in fanmail - I'm given to understand that this is a major part of Nar play. I like it when people respond well to my input, of course, but it's very different for me than Playing to Win-type competition. <br/><br/>Playing to Win, for me, is fundamentally a competition against myself. A skilled opponent and a well-designed game provide me an objective yardstick to measure myself against and improve myself. <br/><br/>I'm completely fine with not doing that at on any given evening. I've enjoyed freeform RP with consensus-based decision making, and that's as non-competitive an arena as my worldview can imagine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150759">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150759/#Comment_150759" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-14T12:18:26+00:00" title="June 14, 2008 12:18PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eric</cite>Anyway, I've seen you comment on this before, so I'd like to hear your thoughts on it, and anyone else's.

If a victory condition exists within the game and there is an optimal method of achieving, then I will take that path.  Even though a game states that there is no winner, in most games, there is a loser.  The tactical element of the game is actually about not losing (or as I see it, winning).  Let me caveat this by saying that when I played PTA (The Line), we had a whole bunch of fun, but as was previously stated, there is no winner, there is no loser, and fanmail is the best RPG currency ever created.  <br/><br/>The conflict that occurs for me is in the interaction between my fun and the other player's fun.   \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>The problem is that, even in most Gamist-oriented play groups, Eric can't play as hard as he wants to without seeming like an asshole, since either the game or the social contract among the players isn't built to sustain the same kind of hardcore intensity as a chess tournament or Street Fighter championship. He's fairly adaptable and often tries to play competitive RPGs (or even more narrative roleplaying games with competitive elements) in a less intense way, but it's really grating for him and goes against his natural instincts.</blockquote>\nWe just started a D&amp;D 4th edition campaign.  But what I experienced here has been mirrored in one form or another by games I've played of TSoY, SotC, or basically any other game where the players are cooperating.  I should say that when the characters are antagonistic, it all bothers me a lot less.<br/><br/>Anyhow, we are all making up our characters and I realize that one of the other players is making, a "sub-optimal" character choice.  This is compounded by the fact that he is a new player and that his character choice will impact my character's effectiveness in combat.  If I speak up, then I am stepping on his fun.  If I don't speak up, then I perceive my fun as being stepped on.  This leaves me in a very uncomfortable position.  I find myself in this type of position often while gaming and it is a difficult one.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eric</cite>Playing to Win, for me, is fundamentally a competition against myself.

The characters should be created by the players all together, giving and receiving advices from each other (or even creating directly a part of the other's characters, as in Carry and Best Friends foe example)<br/><br/>I thought that this wouldn't work in gamist games, because the ability to create the best character is often part of the "step on up". But this talk of teams made me think about the players creating THE TEAM all together, using a finite amount of resources, to "fight" against the perils and adversity created by a GM and to reach a common objective. If you avoid any inter-party competitiveness and do a game where it's the team that win or lose (so, you can even sacrifice your character, it's a good move if it made the team win), should not be the team the "lean and mean fighting machine", not every single character by himself? The amount of resources would not even have to be equal to every character (in something akin to old AD&amp;D, ot would made sense potentiating the Cleric, for example)<br/><br/>Thinking how much team-based is the AD&amp;D I remember (I don't know about the newer edition), I think that method like this to create teams would be the ideal solution to the problem of the difference in player's ability.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150800/#Comment_150800" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-14T20:36:45+00:00" title="June 14, 2008  8:36PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think it's the difference in player ability that's the problem.<br/><br/>Brandon, what sort of fun was the player cutting off?

Put another way, good players pass the ball. <br/><br/>What happens when everyone else on my team just kind of stands around and stares when I pass them the ball?<br/><br/>Concrete example: DnD. I played in an Eberron 3.5 campaign for almost a year. I was playing an Artificer, a metagame class that can effectively double one of the game's basic resources - money. So, played optimally, I can be a force-multiplier for everyone in the group. <br/><br/>One member of the group was April. She played a wizard, and I dumpster-dived for hours through source-books to ensure that she could cast more than twice the spells per day that she has any right to - because I know that when I toss her the ball, metaphorically, she'll do something useful with it.<br/><br/>One member played a rogue-martial multiclass thingy. They're not quite as focused as April and I, but I can still rely on them do something useful with the ball. So I dumpster dived for hours for them, too, and they ran around with a Cloak of Invisibility and... very alarming first-round burst damage. I think they could do 50d6 in the first round at level 9 thanks to my gear optimization, plus some extremely good defenses. <br/><br/>The last player had a much more classically Simulationist style - which, in this particular case, meant that they were a total wild-card in combat. I didn't really feel I could rely on them on a tactical level to follow through when I tossed them the ball. That clearly comes off as a value judgment on my part, but I don't know how else to put it. It's completely legitimate to have that agenda, and that player made lots of good contributions to the game as a whole in other contexts, but tactical optimization wasn't one of them. <br/><br/>So, I kinda phoned in their gear. I would have liked to do more, but... I didn't really know how, and I wasn't really incentivized to try harder. They got a fair cut of the loot and useful, albeit generic, stuff, but the whole "gear maximization" game - which was collaborative process with the other players - didn't really work.<br/><br/>Playing to Win, in a team game, means maximizing the team's potential over my own. I want to do that. Moreover, most team-centric RPGs have entire archetypes that are basically force-multipliers - battlefield-controller, buffers, and so on. Sometimes I want to play those. But it's hard having a "there is no 'I' in team" mindset and approach when the rest of the team isn't even lacing up, and there's no point in playing a force-multiplier when I'm multiplying by a zero. <br/><br/>So, yeah, problematic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150802/#Comment_150802" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-14T20:49:04+00:00" title="June 14, 2008  8:49PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 14, 2008 9:17PM by Eric.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>In other words, Ryan can hear what you have to say, and 1) make his own judgment about what to do, and 2) you can accept it with grace if he decides to make a sub-optimal choice anyway.

Again with the force-multiplier example: if I want to toss a bunch of buffs around and make my teammates into Rockstars, for example, I need to know that I'm going to see the difference. I mean, I can just not play that archetype; hell, I can just run with the All-Star Game mindset where we only vaguely try to be an actual team.

I want to be able to trust the player who gets that ball. And boom, now we've potentially got dysfunction.

It's nothing near that drastic. We're talking about a very fine sliver of effectiveness that might be lost, something like a few points of damage per attack, or an extra +1 to hit or something, due to overlooking a good combo.<br/><br/>It's true that the extra damage or hit bonus will help the team, but the lack of it <b>won't hurt us</b>. D&amp;D4 is <i>extremely</i> forgiving in terms of how much buffer you have between "we're doing the best possible" and "we messed up and now we all die." If you build encounters by the book (which we are) they are all winnable, with resources left over. We're not talking about a WoW 40-man raid or a typical hard 3.x encounter where one mistake by a team member can get the whole party killed. D&amp;D4 encounters just aren't that nasty, and the power selection given to characters is rather good -- they've made it tough to make a bad choice that will actually hurt the team, in other words.<br/><br/>You can still make a sub-optimal choice, of course (arguably all choices but one are sub-optimal). But the <i>consequences</i> of that choice aren't very severe.<br/><br/>To some degree, I'm seeing Brandon wanting optimization for optimization's sake. It's there for the taking, he can see it plain as day, so why don't we all just do it his way? It is the best way, after all. But, since sub-optimal choices don't have severe consequences, we're not all that invested in always making the optimal choice. Our so-called sub-optimal character builds or combat actions still kick ass and take names just fine.<br/><br/>It's not that the other players are refusing to step up and play ball. We are! Very much so. This is <i>not</i> a failure of the other players to engage or play hard. What I see happening is someone playing hard and kicking ass, <i>but they're kicking 4 hit points less ass than they would have if they did it Brandon's way.</i> And those 4 fewer hit points are gonna stick in his craw. And this might happen on every turn, at every decision point, with every power use, as Brandon sees the One Best Move and the other player doesn't do it.<br/><br/>So, does he pipe up every single time and correct us? Does he just run the battle for us and tell us where to stand and what to do next? (this started to happen in the last session). I don't know. I think there's a balance to be found. But, since the second or third best move is <i>just as good</i> in terms of successful play as the best move, my gut feeling is, why fret so much about it?<br/><br/>I say all this in the spirit of the big G, too. We all want to step up and kick butt and be super effective and maximize our awesome. We want someone to say, "You know, if you move over here, you'll be in range of my buff when it goes off next round." That's cool! All good. But! It has to be okay to say, "Yeah, you know what? I don't care about the buff. Yeah, it's 6 extra hit points, but I have a cool thing I want to do now, so I'm gonna run over here and do it. Thanks anyway." That's not failure. That's not bad play.

We are now in a very different, and hyper-niche, section of Playing to Win: striving for perfection. <br/><br/>I have personally won at least one Magic the Gathering tournament, shaken the hand of my opponent, turned around, and began silently cursing myself. I won, but it was sloppy. I could have been better. I could have been closer to perfection.<br/><br/>I'm thinking that it wasn't one of my best moments. And it might have happened more than once...<br/><br/>It's a weird thing, treating such small things so seriously. But, it's basically obsessive. At a certain point, all that stuff about overcoming the self starts to sink in, and the wins and losses fade into the background.

So by the rules it would be 1 by default. You can't pay her now, and you can't pay her later <i>unless you can find a way to obtain the wealth necessary.</i> And that means playing the game.<br/><br/>The way it played out in your session was a great outcome, and would have been even if you both had survived and killed the other two. Situation, which builds to conflict, which creates a new situation, which builds to a new conflict, is a textbook example of how the game should play.<br/><br/>Really, the beautiful thing about that scenario is that there is no optimal strategy. Each character has the ability to tip the scales one way or another.<br/><br/>I've seen the dwarf and the roden make common cause. I've seen the elf and the thief make common cause. I've seen the dwarf and the thief make common cause against the elf and the roden. <br/><br/>The Roden's most lucrative move is probably to make common cause with the human thief, who is also only interested in the sword for its monetary value, and then watch while the elf and dwarf slaughter each other. <br/><br/>I've seen three characters gang up against one. It's also not entirely uncommon for all four characters to work together for their common good without resorting to murdering their friends. It's also not uncommon for the elf or dwarf to use the Duel of Wits to convince his friends to let him keep the sword.<br/><br/>My personal favorite is when the elf, dwarf and thief gang up to murder the roden, as the roden is the only one who knows the way out. That means the journey to the surface will be a long and perilous one, with plenty of chance for backstabbing as the group stumbles around aimlessly underground.<br/><br/>All that said, the important thing to take away is that winning the sword isn't "victory." Its only function is to shape the kind of consequences you will face as the environment adjusts to your choices and the new situation.<br/><br/>So, for instance, as the dwarf, you've convinced the murderous ratman cultist to help murder your friends and have successfully done so. You now own the Sword of Ages but owe the ratman a lot of money (for acting as a guide to and from the tomb, and now also for the value of the priceless magical artifact he helped you retrieve).<br/><br/>Maybe he tries murder you on the way to the surface and claim the Sword of Ages for himself (it would definitely be handy in the war he and his cult plan to initiate with the surface peoples). Great. Instantly we have a new situation.<br/><br/>Or maybe he actually sees you to the surface. You now has to obtain fantastic wealth in order to pay the ratman off, or he's got to ditch or kill the ratman somehow (with a special note that all this deceiving, stealing and killing for a treasure is causing the dwarf's Greed attribute to advance rapidly...a little more of this and he'll be destroyed by it).<br/><br/>Of course, the ratman isn't your only problem. The elven etharch has been keeping an eye on the young elf with her magic, and she saw his foul murder. You were able to kill a young, inexperienced elf with some difficulty. Even with the Sword of Ages, will you be able to evade the elven rangers, lancers and sword singers seeking him and keening the Ballad of Rage? Making it home safely is going to take luck and ingenuity!<br/><br/>Maybe you can rouse the dwarves to your aid, though it's a tough prospect: The dwarves are wise enough to fear the prospect of war with the elves. And yet, the dwarf prince's eyes glitter with a secret fire when they light upon the hilt of the Sword of Ages. On second thought, perhaps the prince will march the dwarves to war afterall. The Sword of Ages in <i>his</i> hand will fire his peoples' blood...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151016">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151016/#Comment_151016" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-16T09:42:10+00:00" title="June 16, 2008  9:42AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 16, 2008 9:43AM by Eric.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thor Olavsrud</cite>Ok.

I think what I was trying to get at is that we set our own victory conditions when we play these kinds of games and we also constantly reinterpret what victory means. <br/><br/>In this particular instance, you decided that victory meant being the last man standing with a claim to the sword. April decided that the promise of payment was enough. I have also seen players decide that it would only be a victory if they won the sword without killing another character. And I have seen the roden decide that it's a victory if he can extort a greater payment out of whoever is left standing by playing on the fact that he's the only one that can guide the group back to the surface.<br/><br/>All of those are perfectly valid. Every outcome can lead to a new and interesting situation.<br/><br/>Unless a game has an objective method for determining victory, like Rune, the outcomes and the determinations of victory and failure are shaped by the victory conditions you set for yourself. And the goalposts can and will change as the situation in the game evolves as long as you remain invested in what might happen next.<br/><br/>In this particular game, it sounds like you guys stopped where you should have. At least two players were no longer invested enough to desire to know what would happen next.<br/><br/>To answer your question, BW as written handles character death much like many RPGs. It's not PTA. The game gives you a degree of agency beyond your character (artha votes, trait votes, reputation votes), but otherwise you're pretty much a spectator. The GM could give you an NPC to play if one's available (though the game doesn't explicitly say that a GM should do this). Or you can make a new character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151101">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151101/#Comment_151101" name="Item_94" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-16T18:35:01+00:00" title="June 16, 2008  6:35PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 16, 2008 6:37PM by Callan_S.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm wondering what Eric's going to say?

I really am genuinely curious as to how my passing introduction to the game matches the actual game - particularly places where, due to brevity or unfamiliarity, our procedures differed substantially from those as written. <br/><br/>Anyway, my short accounting of our BW game illustrates a lot about how I set victory conditions, I think. <br/><br/>First and foremost, if the game presents me anything like a goal or a victory condition at all, even in passing, I'm going to latch onto that pretty fast - especially when first presented with a game. Likewise, I'm going to perceive pretty much anything else on my sheet as a potentially-important rule.<br/><br/>So, my sheet says something about the sword. Maybe that's just flavor text, maybe I can use it or ignore it as I see fit. Maybe it's super-important. Regardless, I'm going to assume it's important, because it looks like a rule. That automatically takes priority in my decision calculus.<br/><br/>So, any thoughts or interests I might have had in what I wanted to chase in the game got trumped by what was on the sheet. If it said I was supposed to be a pacifist, I would have been a pacifist. If it said I was supposed to be a psychopathic murderer, I would have gone with that. In lots of games, that stuff might appear on the sheet as fluff or a roleplaying aid, but again, I'm going to treat it as a rule until I discover otherwise.<br/><br/>It said I wanted the sword and was greedy. Boom, two rules. Everything I did from that point on in the game was governed by these two restrictions.<br/><br/>As Callan guessed, victory conditions and rules in general aren't something I really negotiate in play once I perceive them as being set. Coinciding with this, I suspect that a lot of game designer or adventure writers might not realize the impact that putting that sort of thing on the sheet has on someone like me.<br/><br/>And yeah, I don't like changing the rules mid-game - even in an RPG that's "just for fun," even if it would be to my benefit, enhance my enjoyment, and everyone else at the table supported it. It makes me uncomfortable on a very basic level - especially if it's to my benefit, actually, since it smacks of conflict of interest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151114">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151114/#Comment_151114" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-16T20:10:45+00:00" title="June 16, 2008  8:10PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Curious, Eric: what do you do when presented with multiple victory conditions, some of which are mutually exclusive, and none of which end the game (and thereby allow one player to claim victory over the others)?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_151116">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151116/#Comment_151116" name="Item_97" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-16T20:36:47+00:00" title="June 16, 2008  8:36PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 16, 2008 9:06PM by Eric.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Roby</cite>Curious, Eric: what do you do when presented with multiple victory conditions, some of which are mutually exclusive, and none of which end the game (and thereby allow one player to claim victory over the others)?</blockquote>\nUm... wow. Is this still a zero-sum or constant-sum finite game? Like, you're scooping up victory conditions, some of which preclude grabbing others, while a clock ticks or something else runs along to eventually end the game? In that case, I'd probably chase the ones that seem most practicable or expedient at the time (edit: like in Puerto Rico). Barring any differentiation on that point, I probably go for the one that seems the most compatible with my personal strengths. After that, um... I guess I probably go after what seems the most amusing on other fronts?<br/><br/>If it's infinite, potentially infinite, or not zero-sum/constant-sum... then I'm probably going to need more information <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151203">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151203/#Comment_151203" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-17T12:44:53+00:00" title="June 17, 2008 12:44PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In <em>Agora</em>, there are no explicit win conditions, although there is a lot of tactical back-and-forth, and may of those smaller interactions you could call victories.  But on the strategic level, you can attempt to build the biggest, strongest, bestest faction with the biggest, strongest, bestest dice on the sheet, OR you can attempt to organize all the alliances into a network of which you have controlling interest, OR you can attempt to build an alliance or two to unite the obstacles under your banner... or a lot of things.  And I realize most of that doesn't make much sense.  Put it another way: there are a lot of different resources in the game, and there are a lot of ways to gobble them all up.  And in the end, it's near-impossible to determine which player really has the most control of the most resources.  There is a distinct player-versus-player element in the tactical level, but there are many different ways of determining who "won" the entire game, and the game text does not endorse any particular one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_151244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151244/#Comment_151244" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-17T16:43:50+00:00" title="June 17, 2008  4:43PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 17, 2008 4:47PM by Eric.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Roby</cite>...And in the end, it's near-impossible to determine which player really has the most control of the most resources.

So, you've metaphorically handed us a checkered board and rules for Chess, Checkers, Go, and we figure out which we're going to play. This might be what you're getting at.<br/><br/>2) It's a constant-sum game, and each person calls a victory condition at the outset. The constant-sum clause forces there to be some way to distinguish between victory conditions on some level. I don't think this is what you're getting at.<br/><br/>If we lift the constant-sum condition, then you might get...<br/><br/>3) Non-constant-sum with players choosing victory conditions at the outset. This basically means that people can choose to team up for win-win solutions or dick each other over as they see fit. This is something like where DnD usually sits, for example.<br/><br/>4) Non-constant-sum with players choosing and changing their victory conditions as they see fit. This is drifting into calvinball territory, since each player could hypothetically act at random, then arbitrarily chose whichever victory condition best matches their actual condition at the end of the game - which is to say, everyone does whatever they feel like, followed by everyone declaring themselves the winner. At this point, I personally prefer to not have the pretense of victory conditions at all.<br/><br/>And now we go farther afield...<br/><br/>5) Constant-sum without victory conditions. This is equivalent to playing a fighting game with the timer and each player's life bar set to infinite, or playing basketball while studiously not keeping score - each individual combo or shot becomes a self-contained mini-game, and you play that over and over. This is also equivalent to playing a finite zero-sum game like chess over and over and not keeping score across the games <br/><br/>6) Non-constant-sum with scoring but without victory conditions. Now we're in sandbox-play territory of the Grand Theft Auto variety (among many others), where the game gives you a way to track how well you're doing certain things, but doesn't place any particular imperative on you to do one thing over another.<br/><br/>Does <i>Agora</i> break down cleanly along any of these lines?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151248">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151248/#Comment_151248" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-17T16:58:59+00:00" title="June 17, 2008  4:58PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eric, six stands out as the closest description, at least for <em>Agora</em>.

Roby</cite>Eric, six stands out as the closest description, at least for<em>Agora</em>.  I'm curious: how do you play GTA?</blockquote>\nI've never actually played GTA specifically; the modern-era criminal theme never really grabbed me, regardless of the grace of execution. However, I've played, for example, some of the Elder Scrolls fantasy sandbox games, as well as other games with strong sandbox components.<br/><br/>Here's how it usually goes:<br/><br/>1) The "learning" phase: I start off following the "main" game or plot, if any, while trying to master the game system as best as I can. I might stay in this mode for my entire first playthrough.<br/><br/>2) The "deep learning" phase: I start to veer away from the game's plot as I begin to find exploits or tricks. The God of War and Metal Gear Solid games become sandbox-esque to me at this point, for example, as I play around with finding newer and better exploits. This is when I might deliberately hunt for the strongest lycanthrope to get infected by in a fantasy sandbox game, to see if that's actually a net win.<br/><br/>3) The "application" phase: I use what I've learned in phase 2) to try to collect all the game's achievements. For example, getting Foxhound or collecting all the tags in a MGS game, or finishing all the subquests and optional bosses in a fantasy sandbox game. Getting control of a thieves' guild in an Elder Scrolls game might happen here.<br/><br/>4) The "making crap up" phase. Having exhausted the game's built-in achievements, I start making up my own, such as beating a powerful enemy without that enemy ever getting a move or a successful hit. Very few games last this long, since the game needs to hold up to me, for example, using any useful glitches and bugs as standard tactics while remaining challenging.<br/><br/>Interestingly enough, I've had the best luck at stage 4) with a game that isn't obviously a sandbox game at all: "Final Fantasy Tactics."<br/><br/>edit: as you might have noticed, I'm pretty goal-oriented.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151721">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151721/#Comment_151721" name="Item_102" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-19T16:26:41+00:00" title="June 19, 2008  4:26PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 19, 2008 4:44PM by Callan_S.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I may add my own account, here's an old one I posted at forge (way back in 2005, wow): <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=14560.0;prev_next=next" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=14560.0;prev_next=next</a><br/><br/>It's not GTA, but the game 'Mercenaries' which was a similar sandbox environment. Basically the relevant bit to this thread is that I had a pattern of screwing around before discovering a goal I wanted to complete, then I'd go for it. If it was too much for me, I'd admit defeat.<br/><br/>Special note: By discover, I don't mean the goal is nescersarily in the game, but that a certain set of circumstances speak to me and dare me to win. My brain is actually inventing the goal, but I don't conciously try to. The goal just springs to mind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_152094">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152094/#Comment_152094" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-21T11:34:34+00:00" title="June 21, 2008 11:34AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have not read this thread fully, but I've written a <a href="http://competitiverpgs.wordpress.com/2008/06/21/competitive-games-and-handicaps" rel="nofollow">post</a> inspired by it.<br/><br/>It's a bit longer than my usual posts, and some of its contents are already discussed here, but I hope you'll enjoy it.

I do understand where you are coming from. In RTS and similar I am a scrub player who tends to Turtle a whole lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of my HS friends is very much like you. The main difference is he does not do RPGs. But he is a massive PC and Board Gamer. <br/>\nJeff I swear thinks in statistics. When we play Titan in example, depending on which Tower he starts at is how he divides up his stacks based on the best average die rolls, etc. Always working to optimize his moves, his game play, which unit attacks when, etc. <br/>\nThis carries over into all the board games we still play, LOTR, Titan, etc.<br/>\nSame with RTS games, which buildings in which order to build the correct amount of units, etc.<br/>\nYou understand I am sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso my oldest son Jake, with FPS is just like you. Takes the shortest, perfect route to get to the end goal and then goes back over and over to get EVERYTHING possible. <br/>\n<br/>\nI on the other hand am the sub-optimal player. Once in a while I am the swing vote, meaning I see that one obscure victory condition that I could nab easy if I dont tell anyone else (Been there done that a few times to the annoyance of my better positioned in the game friends), or I am the one that ends up determining who wins by virtue of who I weaken or whack on the most. I am often just ganged up on at the beginning due to that tendency.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I would thoroughly enjoy playing a game with you sometime, I can completely understand where you are coming from, even if I am not in the same place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6755/hardcore-gamism-and-dysfunction-within-the-big-g/p2" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6755/hardcore-gamism-and-dysfunction-within-the-big-g">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6755/hardcore-gamism-and-dysfunction-within-the-big-g/p2" rel="prev">2</a><a class="Highlight p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6755/hardcore-gamism-and-dysfunction-within-the-big-g/p3">3</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F6755%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F6755%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
