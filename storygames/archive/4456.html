I don't know who invented this idea, but we were told that statistically the odds of a person purchasing a book go up significantly when they're actually holding it and looking through it.<br/><br/>The rest of my gaming group comes from what I guess you would call a traditional gaming background, meaning they played D&amp;D in college, maybe tried a session of a Vampire LARP once or twice, but weren't interested, and a couple of players have tried a few different games over the years, but for the most part we all agree on something basic, like <i>Seventh Sea</i>.<br/><br/>I would like to introduce them to the possibilities of story games, to concepts like narrative control, stakes, escalation, aspects, fallout, trust mechanics, keys, all that good stuff.  My introduction to story games came from podcasts, in particular Paul Tevis' ENnie Award-winning <a href="http://havegameswilltravel.libsyn.com/" rel="nofollow">"Have Games Will Travel"</a>, where he manages to lay down in a succinct and enthusiastic fashion what's cool about all kinds of games.<br/><br/>Most of the folks in my gaming group do not listen to podcasts, much less to story game heavy podcast review shows.<br/><br/>So, my thought was what if you could excerpt the reviews of specific games you wanted to get your players hip to?

Is there a better way, short of buying copies of the book and handing it to the players?  I actually did this with "Spirit of the Century", and my players are all looking forward to our first session.<br/><br/>To be fair, I think some of them have listened to the reviews on the CD, others haven't, but it's still better than waiting for them to discover it on their own.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100767">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100767/#Comment_100767" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-03T10:41:17+00:00" title="October  3, 2007 10:41AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a cool idea, Darren.

I mention this because CoC sort of introduced the idea that it could be fun to play in a game where player characters don't necessarily win, rather than some of the more strategic games where there's this strange sort of adversarial relationships between players and gamemaster.  When you take the GM out of the equation, I expect some players really have a hard time working things out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_100824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100824/#Comment_100824" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-03T12:24:39+00:00" title="October  3, 2007 12:24PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm pretty sure if I handed my gaming buddies that cd they'd never listen to it.  That tactic just won't fly with some people.  One of my friends is (or used to be) a HUGE classic Battletech fan, and earlier this year there was an episode of 2d6 Feet in a Random Direction where one of the hosts (if they're around here at all, I apologize for both forgetting your names, and being too lazy to look it up) talked to one of the people at Catalyst Game Labs, mostly about the new Battletech stuff.  I thought to myself, "Damn!  Seth would love to hear this!" and I promptly sent him a link.  He never did.<br/><br/>Anyway!  There's a point here, somewhere.  I my opinion, assuming your friends are open-minded at all, just grab a game and some week say, "Hey, we're gonna try this thing out.  Give it a chance.  If it's cool, we can play it, or things like it more, and if it's not cool, then we can go back to the usual stuff."  It's a nice thing about a lot of these "crazy-hippy-indie-story-games" - they're built for short runs of play.

The play will sell the games better than anything else does. Brian's verbology might not work with everyone, however, telling people that they're just going to play what you want to play. So pitch it like this:<br/>\n<br/>\n"Dude, I so want to run this game for somebody to see what it's like. Help me out, and be a player for me? It should be lots of fun." <br/>\n<br/>\nThat takes some pressure off them to decide, if they're worried that the game might not be good. Becuase they can still play, and if it's bad, they can rationalize it as having helped out a friend. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for CoC being a gateway game... well it's better than D&amp;D for this for several reasons I can think of, yes. But on a scale of one to one hundred, D&amp;D is a ten, and CoC is a 13. Now if they've played Paranioa, on the other hand, or even Ars Magica, those are way better as gateways. Ars Magica troupe play means that the player is automatically used to dissociating himself from one character, even if only to play another. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100830">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100830/#Comment_100830" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-03T12:36:57+00:00" title="October  3, 2007 12:36PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good gods, you got enough copies of SotC for everyone?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_100845">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100845/#Comment_100845" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-03T12:59:12+00:00" title="October  3, 2007 12:59PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh, yeah, with that sort of investment, I hope it turns out well!<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, it will.

The CD of reviews sounds like a great idea, and if it works for your friends great, but I like Brian know that my peeps would never really listen to it. It's astounding to me that the same folks who pore through every D20 supplement as it comes out, or dewvote hours and hours to play and discussion of MMORPGs, don't really have the gumption to look at internet posts, blogs, what-have-you, that *I* think are super-cool.

Those are both "traditional" games.  When players come to a new game, they expect new rules.  If those rules happen to put more narrative and co-gm mechanics in the players hands... so be it.  TSOY can be run fairly "traditionally", covers a lot of the same ground, but recovering pools and getting experience is a bit different and aimed at being "fun".<br/><br/>I would emphasis the fun.  Or the narrow focus of the indie game.  Dogs in the Vineyard is a very specific focus... 1850 Utah, you (the PCs) are Dogs with a ton of leeway to deal with small town's demons.  Not my favorite setting, by the way, but I enjoyed playing it quite a bit.  I don't care for heist movies, but our recent Criminal Element playtest was a blast.<br/><br/>My point being is that the person introducing the game should be passionate about the game, and how it could be fun for everyone.  Not in, "oooooh... TSOY has a neat experience mechanic.." but rather... "ooohh...  TSOY is a good, yummy sword and sorcery vibe that is just making me itch to play".<br/><br/>Unless the target audience is totally a mechanic grognard (and I know a few, and might even resemble one myself)... then launching into the mechanics of the game might go a long way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_107526">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107526/#Comment_107526" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-09T09:57:45+00:00" title="November  9, 2007  9:57AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Personally, to me, 'transitional' games feel sort of dishonest.

Some players are not used to the degree of narrative control some of these games give them, for example.<br/>In any case, I can see the value of games that arent as radical departures from the norm theyve gotten used to.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Ive successfully dived into these games with a group who has had no previous exposure to anything of the sort, and they seem to be enjoying the games! I mean, they may not yet take full advantage of all that narrative control, but I believe theyre getting the hang of it and are aquiring the taste.<br/><br/>So "gateway games" might be useful, though theyre not a neccessity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_107599">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107599/#Comment_107599" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-09T17:26:25+00:00" title="November  9, 2007  5:26PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's not rocket science but some of these games seem to assume experience with/exposure to some of the seminal games and don't provide enough examples of play.<br/>\n<br/>\nCombine that with methods of play/stance/control/focus that might be very different from what most people expect of a "role-playing game" AND that it's often only one person who owns and has read the rules and sometimes people run into trouble.  Check any number of actual play threads for evidence of this.<br/>\n<br/>\nI relate to the space I imagine this comment coming from; one of the biggest obstacles sometimes seems to be an evangelical bent or, alternately, nervousness on the part of the person introducing these kinds of games to their more traditional gaming friends.  They want so much for their friends' first exposure to be a kind of epiphany that they oversell the thing.

With D20 or GURPS or many other games you can ignore a rule here or there and usually things won't implode. You can also get away with statements like "you're a player, just do what you usually do as a player"<br/><br/>Whenever I've played a story game not very precisely, very by-the-book, it's tended to vary from mediocre to a disaster. If I've read the rules, I can't skim the rules and just get the jist. If I'm explaining to other people the rules I have to explain very precisely what a player can and can not do. It is in this sense that I've had more luck teaching these games to non-roleplayers, because they have no habits of "normal play" to slip into.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_107715">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eldir" title="Eldir"><img alt="Eldir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i182.photobucket.com/albums/x208/loki_laufeysson/goplay_dotted_32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eldir">Eldir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107715/#Comment_107715" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-10T15:03:35+00:00" title="November 10, 2007  3:03PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: gamera_spinning</cite>I just wonder what other people have done to try to share the gaming goodness with folks who aren't in a regular position to find it on their own.

He hated it, ended up playing the sick card and skipped out early. I couldn't get him to come to the next two sessions, even though we were playing stuff like T&amp;J and SotC.

The only way to find out is to try and be inclusive, because we all know that these games don't advertise themselves. Neither Jake Richmond or Gregor Hutton are pouring millions into TV ads to show someone there's other avenues than a new Xbox game if you're getting a little tired of D&amp;D. Perhaps you'll consider the route of inclusion, instead of actively trying to freak the normals, so you can feel comfortable in your tower of open-mindedness.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108941">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eldir" title="Eldir"><img alt="Eldir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i182.photobucket.com/albums/x208/loki_laufeysson/goplay_dotted_32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eldir">Eldir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108941/#Comment_108941" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-20T05:38:13+00:00" title="November 20, 2007  5:38AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 20, 2007 5:41AM by Eldir.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alvin Frewer</cite>Well, that certainly does sound like a great way to shut doors.

Kinda like the difference between how it would sound if someone said why would they eat raw fish like the Japanese, as opposed to that they hated sushi because it's really spicy and covered in tentacles. The latter is purely a matter of personal taste. The former is what the guy's reaction to playing a teenaged girl sounded like to me. Obviously I don't know him and he may well be a swell guy, he just voiced his objection in a manner that I find strange. <br/><br/>To clarify, what I said about weeding people out was an exasperated joke. Not the most productive thing and probably a moot point anyway, since I doubt someone who finds playing teenaged girls so objectionable would be that crazy about a woman gamemaster.\n<blockquote>If you're really interested in opening other people's minds to new possibilities, it's best to bring them over slowly instead of throwing them into the deep end.</blockquote>\nOr maybe ask them what they would like to play. Some things just won't be some people's cup of tea and that's perfectly all right, but I don't think the common ground you speak of lies in outward similarities with D&amp;D. Rather I think it's in commonalities in taste and the kind of play experience people want. If I'm not that into pulp I probably won't get into SotC, and if I don't enjoy the pressures and rivalries in a closed group I probably won't like Panty Explosion or Best Friends no matter how much Burning Wheel I play beforehand.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_108946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108946/#Comment_108946" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-20T06:08:16+00:00" title="November 20, 2007  6:08AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And to clarify, I was a little shocked that he bowed out like he did, but we worked things out.

But yeah, when playing with anyone the first time, it's best to find out what they want to play (and what they absolutely won't want to play) before you dive into it. That's good sense even if you both are into the same style of games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
