Ten days late, but still plenty early for Halloween.\n<blockquote><i>When I was a kid, I was infatuated with ghost stories. I read everything and anything I could find about ghosts. I didn\u2019t discriminate between fiction and dubious nonfiction and folklore. I don\u2019t remember all, or even most, of the stories now. Mostly I\u2019ve retained fragments without context. I remember a Victorian child who fell down a flight of stairs, leaving a blood stain at the bottom that would return, undeterred after every cleaning day. I remember the witch\u2019s jawbone, and how her spirit would leave fruit and toys for poor sick Mrs. Bell, even while it consumed her husband\u2019s life. I remember the hitchhiker\u2019s abandoned jacket, and her tombstone.<br/><br/>I only remember those fragments now, because I grew old enough to stop thinking about ghost stories and to start thinking about work and codependent relationship and role-playing games about post-Reconstruction racism. I also grew old enough to realize I had lost something, or many things.</i><br/><br/><i>Shade</i> is a ghost story game. It\u2019s also a game about how life diminishes us, and how death (or our ideas about it) empowers us. It\u2019s a simple narrative role-playing game that can be played in a single sitting.<br/><br/><i>Shade</i> uses a custom deck of personality cards to guide each character\u2019s journey through life, and their transformation after death.</blockquote>\n<a href="http://www.miserytourism.com/shade/" rel="nofollow">miserytourism.com/shade/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
