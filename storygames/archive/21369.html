We do this thing here because of those reasons there!<br/><br/>Then when time came to pick a plan template it felt awkward to just pick one at random, so we too came up with an actual plan.<br/>This was a discussion that took maybe 2 minutes, again with one person throwing an idea on the table that everyone likes, and then mapping it to one of the available templates.<br/><br/>Specifically.<br/>We need to "kidnap" a ghost being held in the basement of a house near the docks and being guarded by some powerful gang people.<br/>We decide to get into the target basement digging a hole in the wall of an adjacent basement. Someone adds that it would be good to get in this other basement from the wall facing one of the many city canals.<br/>And we all agree and roll with it.<br/><br/>So... what IS in practical terms this dreaded "planning" that the game helps avoid?<br/>Can anyone offer specific actual play examples?<br/><br/>Or is "bad planning" only that thing when Players disagree on something and start endlessly bickering over it?<br/>Because that's what I call plain and simple "Player disagreement" and BitD doesn't seem (as far as I understand it) to handle it at all.<br/>So, what gives?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467697">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467697/#Comment_467697" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-15T17:43:43+00:00" title="November 15, 2017  5:43PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let me talk about my experience with bad planning.<br/><br/>I once played in a <i>Shadowrun</i> game at a convention. There were 6-7 players of all different types. Pre-generated characters. I took the "Face" type. <br/><br/>Our mission was some kind of heist but we had reason to be paranoid about our patron. I was to meet with the patron at a coffee shop to get some information about the job, if I remember correctly. <br/><br/>But first we had to PLAN.<br/><br/>The group all kicked into gear, doing what each one did best. There was recon, drone surveillance, hacking, infiltration, and so on. First we came up with a course of action -- that took 15-20 minutes.<br/><br/>Then each player took 10-15 minutes to play out their part, with exposition, dice rolls, and narration of results. Failures produced new avenues to try. Successes sometimes offered new things to worry about, new obstacles for the plan. More things for preparation.<br/><br/>After about an hour of this, we were SET UP. It was my turn to go in and negotiate a deal, gather what information I could, figure out what was Really Going On. I was going to go in alone, but our bodyguard thug type insisted on accompanying me for backup. Fine.<br/><br/>We go in, my character sits down with the contact. The bodyguard goes Leroy Jenkins on the situation (I think he was reacting to a heavily armed dude there) and violence breaks out. All planning was now invalid and I never got say more than "hello" in character. <br/><br/>Now everyone else went back into planning mode. What's the NEW PLAN?<br/><br/>The hotel fire alarm went off and we all had to go outside for five minutes. I used that opportunity to gather my stuff and leave and just not come back. I had not had any fun in about 90 minutes.<br/><br/>----------<br/><br/><i>Blades in the Dark</i> makes most of that detailed planning activity unnecessary. If you're going to do a heist, come up with a general plan (5-10 minutes of discussion) and get into the thick of it. You can skip all the SETUP activities, though, because the resolution system lets you take the least interesting steps and turn them into Assist actions after the GM tosses an obstacle in your way. Take a Stress, explain how you're assisting, give the other player an extra die. Granted, only one player can Assist any given roll, but it works out nicely in play.<br/><br/>I've only played Blades once (this past weekend), but it obviated all the issues I've had with traditional heist games.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467698/#Comment_467698" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-15T17:44:44+00:00" title="November 15, 2017  5:44PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I forgot about the Plan Templates.

The players can at any time say \u201cI planned for that!\u201d, play a short flashback showing how they prepared something in advance for what\u2019s going on right now, and have a useful thing in place when they snap back to \u201cnow\u201d.<br/><br/>Of course players should establish some sort of plan, at least enough to decide on a basic approach (the plan templates), but not engage in what Adam_Dray describes. And of course, if your group genuinely enjoys long, drawn out planning, trying to account for every eventuality, you can do that too. But considering the basic \u201ccut to the chase\u201d idea of Blades, you probably don\u2019t need that system for your game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467716/#Comment_467716" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-15T22:05:15+00:00" title="November 15, 2017 10:05PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Double-cross is a pattern in Noir crime novels.

It sure didn't feel like action. <br/><br/>The issue wasn't the crunchiness of the system or the 6-7 players at the table. I have played games with crunch and large numbers of players and had fun.<br/><br/>The issue was that Shadowrun's deep niche protection is focused on activities that characters often do alone.

Ok, awesome.<br/><br/>BUT......<br/><br/>....then there's this stuff in the Downtime section that talks about +1d for Gathering Information regarding the score, and a weird break in the time space continuum regarding the Acquire Assets Downtime Activity. According to the rules, Acquire Assets happens before Free Play, which is when opportunities for a score appear. But how am I supposed to know what kind of Asset to acquire if the Score hasn't been decided yet AND I'm supposed to jump right into the Engagement roll.<br/><br/>I mean, it's easy just to fudge Downtime and FreePlay together ( "Here's you Payoff and Heat. Do what you guys want, but here's a select list of 6 things that you can only pick twice from during that time while I secretly roll for Entanglements to see what you run into during that time" ), which is how I plan on running it in our next session.<br/><br/>As an aside...<br/>Our first session was all character creation, followed by running a short Score which awarded the Lair and Crew sheet...which we ALMOST completed. One of the tricky things about the game is that while the character/crew creation is fairly quick and easy by itself in theory, EVERYTHING is to tied into the world and how it operates, that you spend a lot of time discussing that world, because it's so esoteric. <br/><br/>For example: It's really hard to gloss over the "choose your heritage" part, given that you are awarded XP at the end of every session for "expressing that heritage". So, now you are spending 15 minutes deciding how close country X is to stereotypical Egypt or Africa just to get into the meat of the game itself.<br/><br/>Another example: It's also really hard to gloss over how ghosts wind up working in the world ( "just say it's Industrial Revolution era with ghosts" ) when a specific playbook deals with all the wackiness of the ghost field ( along with all the other special abilities on other playbooks). Because, then that leads into what is a spirit mask and the Spirit Warden and the job that they do in the world.<br/><br/>It's all awesome that soooooo much of the world and it's uniqueness has been fleshed out in that detail. But it's not really a "quick-start and play" game either because of it.<br/><br/>I wound up putting a google doc putting together of a lot of the important highlight of the world for my players to read beforehand ( along with the playbooks ) to try and bypass a lot of the first session "here's the world" bog down. And it helped, but there were still a lot of questions.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467743">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467743/#Comment_467743" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-16T20:13:49+00:00" title="November 16, 2017  8:13PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">@Adam_Dray</a> let's be clear on one thing.

Because this has totally happened to me.  I put "willing" in quotes above, because it's not really something the players WANT to do, but they feel like they need to find the best/safest way to do the thing.   This is the problem Blades is trying to address, and, in my experience, does.   The group needs a basic plan -  "We'll go in through the skylight, take out the guards, grab the loot, and get the hell out of there." but is discouraged from "Well, what if Drayven the Fist is guarding the place? We need a way to take him out." and then spending two hours of play time coming up with an elaborate method to neutralize a character who turns out not even to be there at all.  <br/><br/>The objective of the design is to avoid planning for stuff that isn't relevant. Because you can flashback and deal with it once you know it is relevant.<br/><br/>So no, Hasimir, it's not some secret code word.  It's "planning" - as in "trying to come up with answers to all the contingencies" and if you've never had a group that's done it, it's not because you have a different definition or that it's some "pet peeve" of John Harper's.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467774">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467774/#Comment_467774" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-17T16:36:51+00:00" title="November 17, 2017  4:36PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That makes sense to me, Arik.<br/><br/>I've even seen groups which commend someone for being a "good role player" because that person is willing to play a daredevil or impulsive character who will get things moving.

Or, also a factor, spending lots of time to perform an individual task due to exceedingly slow mechanics.<br/><br/>So... in my gaming universe... <b>the planning problem</b> got solved many many years ago, in many different ways, through many different systems.<br/><br/>I'm sure, as I'm now playing it and seeing with my own eyes, that Blades has its unique take on this, and offers a specific and unique (and appreciable) take on the matter.<br/><b>That's majorly cool!</b><br/><br/>I just got a bit baffled when the MAIN selling point (one that Harper explicitly mentions in the very first vlog of his youtube demo campaign, and that gets repeated anywhere I read something about Blades) of this game seems to be advertised as "<i>the solution to the planning problem</i>".<br/>Which feels doubly strange as it even eclipses other awesome stuff this game has going on, like the very deep and unique setting (which I love) or the focus on building and growing and managing the crew almost in a boardgamey way (which I love).<br/><br/>This in turn created a small problem for me and <a href="/forums/profile/MattB">@MattB</a> at the table after two session in which he kept talking about "planning" as this horrible hole of fun-killing dread, and how this Blades game finally solved such a terrible problem, allowing us to jump to the fun part.<br/><br/>This immediately rubbed me the wrong way as, in my experience of the past 15 years, "planning" was never a problem, and even a fun and engaging part of the game. So after two sessions worth of this kind of talk I mentioned MY problem to him, we talked about it and promptly smoothed it out. <br/>Love wins again <img alt="&lt;3" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/heart.png" title="&lt;3"/><br/><br/>But still, this thing grabbed my attention.<br/>And then we actually played the game, and we "planned".<br/>So then I watched Harper's youtube demo, and they "planned" too.<br/>So I came here to ask and discuss: hey, am I missing something??? <img alt=":confused:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/confused.png" title=":confused:"/> <br/><br/>That's all.<br/><br/>So if by "planning" you mean &lt;i&gt;the Players endlessly ruminating on what to do, whine never actually doing anything substantial, which eventually culminates in some sort of fuck-up requiring the group to restart the endless cycle of empty ruminations on what to do ... then ok... this is no fun.<br/>But this is also <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b><i>not</i></b></span> what "planning" looks like in my gaming experience of the past 15 years.

So by design the framing is more aggressive and the mechanics tend to flow with a faster and more expedient pace.<br/>Fast spotlight handling is also an important factor.<br/><br/>Some games allow Players whose PC is not in the current scene to still participate in it to some extent, and in general encourage the idea of being an engaged audience to the story of other characters... instead of considering "dead idle time" any moment where your own PC is not under the spotlight.<br/><br/>There are mechanics helping the GM to get the Players moving. Translating ideas into scene starts.

I think it's an apt parallel because that, too, was largely a game about rogues in the big city trying to better their station in life through a number of crazy heists.<br/>However, it was also a game about who these rogues really were as people, and also about how crazy and weird and fantastic and mundane the world they inhabited, and was mostly successful on both accounts - the "we're rogues trying to strike it big" situation seed serving at times just as a backdrop (including PCs embracing it and PCs trying to break the mold). The general flow of the game was reminiscent of AW, despite a number of meaningful differences.<br/><br/>What happened in those few not-so-good sessions was that two or more players started an in-character conversation about what do to next, including choosing amongst a number of possible heists to set up and agreeing on the details of execution. Such situations were common - not just limited to those few sub-par sessions - but were at their best, and fully successful, when two or more PCs disagreed on principle: then they would break the meeting and each strike out on their own, or perhaps in twos, resulting in parallel storylines - both interesting to play and to listen to. Problems perhaps arose when a PC insisted they all acted together as a party, and was willing to compromise toward that end, like a very reasonable person would (some flavors of RPGs, including most games by Vincent Baker, really benefit from sanguine, hot-headed and less-than-reasonable PCs -- they depend on them, even): then, they in-character meeting would drag just as long as a real-life meeting, eating up all of the remainder of the session.<br/><br/>When that happens, it can be exhausting after a while. Plus, I noticed these things happening:<br/><br/>- after a while, you're not sure how much you're in-character anymore. Perhaps, a player who's character was not supposed to be physically there chimed in, and I had to remark, as the GM: "Wait a moment! Where were you having this conversation, again, and when?" Not as a way to shut down the intervening player, you know (they should be excused, as it's boring as hell to watch people making plans and not even being able to chime in!) - but because I, the GM, actually got confused!<br/><br/>- after a while more, confusion starts arising between what we've said and was actually a done, accomplished fact and what we'd said as a possible course of action, still subject to confirmation or revision. Like, someone mentioned buying rope, and someone else is now assuming they have rope, while I as the GM thought they were merely inquiring about the price of rope but this conversation was supposedly taking place in the dead of night when markets are closed, so of course one could go for rope, but tomorrow morning, on the way to Aktebeth's mansion... "Oh, and have we all agreed we're going to murder the wizard, then?" "What, wait, I thought I'd said no, I'm not gonna murder anybody at all!"<br/><br/>That's the Shared Imagined Space breaking down, at the fundamental level of not being quite fully and clearly shared anymore. Like, not a big, dramatic breakdown - more of a dull, unexciting erosion, but it's entropy nonetheless!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467819/#Comment_467819" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-18T21:55:48+00:00" title="November 18, 2017  9:55PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with that reading, Rafu.

Most games make your decisions simpler in some way.  When it comes to planning, RPGs don't (not unless they're very rules-first, fiction-second).<br/><br/>So, if you have a table full of players who agonize over decisions and make themselves miserable trying to make sure they get everything just right, then that'll be your planning experience.  Or if you have a table full of players who avoid tricky decisions and just do something else until fate intervenes, then <i>that</i> will be your planning experience.  This means that mileage varies immensely.  A table full of inspired and efficient decision-makers will have a <i>great</i> time planning.<br/><br/>So, if your table has some hitches in its decision-making, what to do?  Well, some RPGs have said, "Don't plan.  Retcon anything you need."  I'm thinking of the Cortex-based Leverage game, but I know I've seen several others.  I think this is the right approach for a story-making game, because watching characters plan isn't usually that dramatic or interesting, and when it is, it's just as good or better as a flashback.<br/><br/>For a challenge game, though, "Retcon whatever you need," is terrible.  It takes the single most important type of player decision the game could potentially feature and just removes it.  I'm not saying that every challenge game results in players stealing victory from the jaws of defeat via clever planning.  But the potential is there.  I've done it.  A lot.  And it feels <i>awesome</i>.<br/><br/>I think Blades attempts an interesting middle ground.  If you're not gonna play through every planning decision, at least settle on an approach well enough to pick a Template, and then allow that Template to factor into what happens.  Or, if you <i>do</i> want to play through every planning decision (I know that's not by the book, but stuff happens), the set of Templates provides useful inspiration and guidance!<br/><br/>Perhaps even more interesting is The Sprawl, where there's a little resource management around what you've done as prep before the caper itself.  It can't be an infinite amount of just anything, so ration accordingly!  (Disclaimer: for all I know, Leverage is like this too; I haven't played it.)<br/><br/>I've done some tinkering of my own with strategic planning mechanics, both a risk-reward deal for prep (the more ambitious the thing you wish to have done, the more risk that your attempt to achieve it had fallout which will now catch up to you), and a decision-making guide for inefficient planners.  I consider this problem -- optimizing planning in RPGs -- as yet unsolved, but ultimately solvable (probably!).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467933">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467933/#Comment_467933" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-23T02:52:53+00:00" title="November 23, 2017  2:52AM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, it's only solvable to the extent that you can get people not to be hideously risk-averse.

If the players recognize the need to go get more info before planning, there's no problem.<br/><br/>When I played Blades, I think we made a short countdown clock for casing the place we were about to hit.  The GM made up a few risks for us to roll for to tick off segments.  By the end, we knew enough to ground our approach.

And that's not just on the PC side; it's also on the GM's side, who has (presumably) some prep, and can make up some other details, but is basically working off a vague mental image of the obstacles in the way of the PCs' path. Sometimes that's not enough, either.<br/><br/>For instance, in my last D&amp;D game, we were given a vague map of the area we were going into, and we had to choose a path. Do we go along the mountains? Or stick to the forest? Where will we cross the road?<br/><br/>However, we didn't really know the implications of any of those choices, or the possible consequences. We knew there might be bad guys, but not what their means of surveillance were. So we spent a long time making a plan, but, in the end, I'm not sure it mattered. (I suspect there's a bit of Illusionism going on in that game, as well, which complicates things further.) Picking an approach at random might have served us just as well, when traveling into totally unknown territory. (And without knowing necessarily how the GM would adjudicate things. At one point we deliberated for ages about how to run across a 2km stretch of open landscape, only to discover that there was no surveillance there at all, but in the forest where we ended up, there was an encounter - not sure if it was random or planned, however. Effectively, this meant that we spent a good chunk of time deliberating about movement rates, and one guy even came up with a clever Illusion plan, but finally ended up fighting an encounter with no real preparation or consistent tactical approach. In the end, planning time was a waste, and the actual encounter - which turned out to be really easily overcome because of our mechanical character abilities, but that's possibly irrelevant - made us look like we were totally unprepared.)<br/><br/>In comparison, I had a relatively good planning experience in a "counter-terrorist op" GURPS game, because the GM laid out a ton of info for us, including a very detailed map of the place we were going to case. A brief of military-grade intelligence, in other words.<br/><br/>Of course, we still didn't have the *player expertise* to make a brilliant plan, but it least we were working on solid intelligence, so our planning had a chance to matter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467954">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467954/#Comment_467954" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-23T17:13:09+00:00" title="November 23, 2017  5:13PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 23, 2017 5:21PM by David_Berg.">edited November 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Picking an approach at random might have served us just as well, when traveling into totally unknown territory.</p></div></blockquote>Yup.  Failing to realize that and get on with it is what I'm talking about as bad process.

(is it analyze ?)<br/><br/>If you allow the GM to concentrate on a single approach from the gang, he will have multiple representations ready. But if the gang wants a 4D picture of the target or the place, the GM needs mechanical help. Having to come up with many details,  without being a security professional, the GM will make consistency errors. In a RPG this somehow turns into plain playing the GM. <br/><br/>Don't blame me for stating the obvious.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467964/#Comment_467964" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-23T19:07:06+00:00" title="November 23, 2017  7:07PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 23, 2017 7:13PM by Airk.">edited November 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Yeah, I think that's exactly the dilemma we're dealing with in this thread, right?<br/><br/>How would you feel about this hypothetical:<br/><br/>You're playing "Blades", but your group takes extra time to make a plan anyway.</p></div></blockquote>\nThis is GM failure to me;  In Blades, The GM is supposed to cut this stuff short.  I would be annoyed if they did not.<br/><br/>Anyway, yes: There is nothing stopping you from zooming in more if you want - but this is all still within the format you are supposed to be playing in;  You are trying to find the detail of your plan.  Finding that detail could be one "gather info" roll, it could be a series of actions, or it could be an entire separate score.   That has zero to do with planning.  Planning is when you're all sitting around a table in your lair trying to reason your way through a situation it's literally impossible for you to have perfect information about, even if the GM has a perfect idea of the situation which they don't.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467965">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467965/#Comment_467965" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-23T19:07:22+00:00" title="November 23, 2017  7:07PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I'm not actually an especially incautious player in challenge-based scenarios.

Instead of the shy or the individualist player making his decision on the fly, he's pressured by the controlling players to proceed by the plan. The ideas that make it to the plan are the ones that the controlling players approve. Any power relationships in the group tend to be emphasized in the planning phase. What is being proposed is not nearly as important as who's saying it.<br/><br/>2) It's about making "smart" decisions. Emotional decisions are framed as irrational decisions, even if they make total sense in the game's supposed genre. Everyone starts to play their smartest self, to look as smart as possible to the other players. Playing an emotional character just makes you an outsider and a troublemaker.<br/><br/>3) It's intensely speculative. The whole point of planning is to prepare for everything, and imagining a parallel, "smart" world becomes almost like a contest. <br/><br/>I end up feeling like a free jazz player who's forced to play a swing tune composed by control freaks, or becoming one myself.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
