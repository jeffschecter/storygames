                    I was thinking about fantasy races this morning, specifically about what makes them compelling. <br/><br/>There are some ideas in evolutionary psychology that suggest religious concepts are particularly engaging because they often contain a contradiction or nonintuitive aspect. E.g., How can you have a trinity of beings who are also <em>one</em> being? That's non-intuitive, and so our brains hold onto it. Another part of the theory is that more than one contradiction is too much to handle: just one is best.<br/><br/>Perhaps this is part of why Elves, say, are compelling: they're basically humans, with human emotions and culture, but they live forever (Or a very long time, whatever.) So they're humans except for breaking one rule, which is both counter-intuitive (how can their biology do that if they're otherwise like us?) and also offers up a lot of interesting possibilites.<br/><br/>You could have "Humans...but who live forever, <em>and</em> eat rocks." But that's just dumb. It's too complicated. How does eating rocks interface with living forever. I don't know. But If you just have a race that's "humans but eats rocks," that seems more approachable, yet still compelling.<br/><br/>(As an aside, calling them "races," while biologically pretty dubious, actually makes some sense, because they really are all just humans with one change. Like the Star Trek aliens: humans with a funny nose.)<br/><br/>Thoughts?                </div>

                            There are going to be lots of different answers to this question, I think. Elves are a particular bugaboo, especially in the exact moment we're living in, so I'll talk about them for a moment. <br/><br/>There are folks who like elves because of the transhuman elements you mentioned. <br/><br/>There are folks who like elves because they are close to the creatures of mythologies and religions that have informed our society for thousands of years. <br/><br/>There are those who like elves because they were in Tolkien and Tolkien gave them something magical that touched their hearts, and they want to constantly relive that moment. <br/><br/>There are those who like elves because they played D&amp;D in their teen years and elves got bound up with issues of coolness, attractiveness, and sexuality (bondage Drow!) that have come to be part of their self-identity. Playing elves for them is like playing the Slayer (or Cordellia) in a Buffy game -- you are the pretty, the cool, the awesome, fey thing that your clumping, awkward highschool self couldn't pull off.  (Ditto those who watched to much "Record of the Lodos War" Ã¢â‚¬â€œ where everyone who is anyone bangs a hot elven babe.) <br/><br/>There are those who like elves because they touch on race/class/genetic ideals of power, of rightful inheritance of racial wisdom, of essentialism and its difficulties, of the "high folk" and the "pure tongue" that have a (not always positive) association in our culture. This also gets into things John Kim has said about the Midwestern ideology of race as it showed up in early D&amp;D -- classes work together to form teams and communities, but mixed race groups cause divisiveness. I'm always amused by gamers reading "Visions of the Daughters of Albion" and such works by Blake who go, "Holy shit, the villain in this story is fucking Elrond!" <br/><br/>There are those who like elves because they can auto-detect secret doors, get a bonus to bows and DEX, and have pointy ears. This makes them wicked cool in a dudgeon environment. <br/><br/>There are those who like elves because they allow for folks to take a single, easily expressed issue of human identity and pull it away from the morass of the foul rag and bone shop of the human heart to examine/play with/revel in that aspect in isolation. (Klingons warrior culture, Vulcan's over-logic, elven longevity and ties to nature, etc.) <br/><br/>And then there are those who have mixes, morasses, and half-formed opinions about various combinations of all of the above. Plus, I'm sure there are more that I haven't even thought about.<br/><br/>Edit: Such as this right here: <a href="http://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&amp;c=Article&amp;cid=1142775309827&amp;call_pageid=991479973472&amp;col=991929131147" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&amp;c=Article&amp;cid=1142775309827&amp;call_pageid=991479973472&amp;col=991929131147</a> -- fantasy races for when real isn't good enough anymore. Can't push your game to the limit? Add an elf!                        </div>

                            Hi, Jasper!<br/>
<br/>
In my group, we never think about elfs as "normal humans with a change". This idea is completely unattractive to us. As much as most science-fiction races which are basically human.<br/>
<br/>
For us, fantasy races are interesting as far as they are part of a mythical world. They represent powers, ideals, or opposite forces.<br/>
<br/>
Of course they have human feelings, but in general they have extreme or simplified patterns, as they are highly symbolic. We never thought about them as natural-beings, and we never consider they could be inserted in a working ecology.<br/>
<br/>
This is the reason we feel that some of the magic is lost when we use them as player characters.<br/>
<br/>

                            Brand, I hate elves for many of the reasons you mention above.  Even in my obsessive Tolkein-fan days, I never liked them.  They seem like such the darlings -- beautiful and immortal and essential to the plot and all that.  <br/>
<br/>
Now orcs, on the other hand... orcs are ugly and dirty and replaceable.  Orcs get pushed around and manipulated by everybody, even their masters.  Even orcs don't like orcs that much.  But orcs keep on doing what they do best.  <br/>
<br/>
I can identify with orcs.                        </div>

                            Sidhe were broken in Changeling, from the bottom up, from system to setting to play.  It wasn't intentional, but they were made to be hated for as many reasons as possible.<br/><br/>On the subject, however, if you want to see one of the purest expressions of why people find fantasy races compelling, take a look at the Changeling book and specifically the nine spreads that present the nine kiths.  There's actually a pretty good representation of "stuff that you might like" each applied to one kith.  You dig on terrible beauty, play a sidhe.  You like tinkerers, play a nocker.  You like barbarism, play a redcap.  Later attempts to "add more kiths" usually ran into the problem that most of the "stuff that you might like" was already represented, so nobody wasn interested in your new addition.                        </div>

                            Josh, <br/><br/>The other problem Changeling got into was that (especially on MUSHes) everyone would want to play the new hot kith because it was the new hottness. <br/><br/>Then after a month all the new hot kith would get dropped, and everyone would be back to Trolls, Satyrs, Sidhe, and some Eshu.                        </div>

                            Well for me I love the folkloric aspects of Elves (Liosalfar, Dockalfar, Sidhe*) <br/>
I also like the semi mythic aspects Tolkien created. Immortal, enduring, but  also delicate in presentation. (Shadow falls upon their souls and they sail to the West, weary by emotional distress.)<br/>
<br/>

*sidhe=hill, shortened from Aes Sidhe--People of the Hills, the name given to the Tuatha De Dannan in folklore/myth as an evolution of their "history"--its notable that Sidhe/Tuatha are sometimes gods or godlike, and sometimes reduced to "near mortals".                        </div>

                            There was something I said on the now-defunct RPG Theory forum at the Forge that I think still applies to my attraction to non-human entities (elves, angels, demons, spirits, Exalted, etc.).<br/>
<br/>
What I like about portraying non-human creatures is that they allow me to refocus aspects of the human condition.  For mey, they are not just humans in funny suits, but human beings explored from a different lens: adding, removing, or altering traits that we tend to identify as human.  Things like mortality, empathy, reason, instinct, and sensory perception (with a strong preference for vision).  In other words, non-human races can bring into focus a lot of the things we take for granted about our humanity, thus allowing us to see what we would be like were we different in particular ways.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, there are questions and ideas I'd like to be able to explore in a roleplaying context that would otherwise be more difficult without the creation of non-human races.  For instance, exactly what does it mean to say that "all men are created equal?"  Does this equality rest upon equal physical and mental abilities, or having advantages and disadvantages balance out?  Or is there something deeper to the meaning of that phrase?  Theoretically, I could simply use various human races to explore that question, but I'd rather not since it would more than likely distract from the question than focus on it.<br/>
<br/>
Heck, it would even make for a great non-standard Exalted game.                        </div>
