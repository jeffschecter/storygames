As I discussed in the introduction thread: \n<blockquote>I have a friend who is an activist who is struggling with finding effective ways of communicating issues regarding race and poverty to a subset of the group she works with. <br/><br/>I suggested an rpg. After she got done looking at me like I was growing a horn out of my forehead, I explained that games like these start with player characters who have strengths and weakness, and those are defined by the game. Those players have to play those characters within the constraints defined by their character using a narrative that's provided by the gamemaster. And that sociologists have been successful in using directed gameplay with some of the topics she wants to address. </blockquote>\nSo now I think I have been volunteered to find or help build a game.   But that's almost okay, because if this game gets built, she's gonna be co-gamemaster. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> <br/><br/>So my idea was to create a game in which the characters are constrained by their poverty and/or race. I want this be a fairly short game that can be played in a couple of hours at the most.  And most importantly, there will be no mechanism in place for anyone to win.  <br/><br/>I've had a few idea of about using character traits as spectrums regarding physical health, mental health, poverty level, and thinking about whether to create further hindrances in the game if the character's skin color is very dark (because of the very real and very proven impact this has in the real world).  Also, with people of color, assertiveness can and is often seen as aggression by law enforcement.  So I've thought about including a mechanism when a player becomes assertive or challenges the game master, the police harassment will increase in the game.  I think scenarios will be very easy to obtain, either from the news or from the extensive network my friend has with other activists and people of color.  But I need a framework. <br/><br/>Eeek!!!<br/><br/>I'm willing to do the work but not even sure where to start as this all totally new to me.   I'm willing to consider GM-less games even, if it takes me to the finished product I want to make. Any guidance thrown my way will be greatly appreciated, no matter how small. Thanks in advance for the help!                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449765">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449765/#Comment_449765" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-26T02:19:06+00:00" title="November 26, 2015  2:19AM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A friend of mine has a similar project lying around from a few years back, we worked on it a fair bit before he set it aside in favor of something less depressing. The specific context in our thing was/is specifically Finnish: the game focused on the phenomenon of "social alienation" (no idea if that's the correct sociological term in English) suffered particularly by the lonesome, the unemployed, the alcoholics, the immigrants, the elderly and those otherwise thrust outside the ordinary life of the community around them. Being as how our social circles largely consist of various peoples of precariat class (that is, a wide range of people without stable incomes and life goals, for reasons varying from studying to chronic unemployment to laziness), the subject matter is close at heart - social alienation is a real possibility for quite many people around here in my everyday life.<br/><br/>I should mention that James Brown's <a href="https://rpggeek.com/rpgitem/43885/deaths-door" rel="nofollow">Death's Door</a> was a major inspiration on this; you might wish to look at it as well, I suspect it would be highly relevant to what you're planning here.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most amusing part of the game was that we used real social services forms as character sheets and character creation aids: basically, the players would select the appropriate sorts of forms for the sort of character they wanted to play, and start filling them with the character's information - student loan applications, work agency registrations, whatever (there's quite a range of this stuff out there, you could come to the game table with a fat folder of possibilities). Two or three forms per character would round them out quite well, and give the player a sense for the manner in which their character was socially alienated; the possibilities are huge, after all, and if I learned one thing from this game, it's that anybody and everybody can become alienated pretty easily in the right conditions.<br/><br/>Aside from the forms, we would construct a bit of a social map of the setting the characters live in; this would include various people against whom each individual player character brushes in their daily life, with the assumption that the created PCs were acquaintances of acquaintances to each other - not familiar, but with people shared between them. Of course, this being about alienation, there were some limitations to the business of social networking; the PCs could only have superficial relationships to begin with, with the player determining whether each individual relationship was an old one gone stale in the process of alienation, or a tenuous one with no chance to become anything real so far. Basically, the player characters were all alone in a world with a cast of a dozen or two dozen NPCs.<br/><br/>The actual play of the game was GMless, with the players taking turns framing scenes for each other's characters. I forget how the dicing worked, but the focus of play was to learn to understand the underlying reasons for your PCs alienation (you started with the external facts in the character generation, remember, so you'd know that your character is an unemployed single mother without any friends and a daytime tv addiction, but you would probably have no firm idea of the why and how she came to that point in her life), and to see if they might improve, or remain in this static half-life that the game painted alienation as. The PCs might occasionally cross paths, but often it's only the shared NPCs that would interact. As a single-session game we'd find out whether each given PC had any hope of surviving their alienation after about half a dozen scenes for each. I think there was maybe some mechanical way of figuring out when the game ends, but I forget what it was.<br/><br/>Anyway, maybe you're trying to make something like that. It's an interesting game, but pretty serious and depressing to play, so it becomes difficult to maintain enthusiasm for playing it more than a few times. I imagine that gamifying it a bit more would help, perhaps by making it more of a challenge to see if you can fix your character's life in some sort of a more complex mechanical framework, instead of just learning about it and making some initiatives in a relatively rules-light context. On the other hand, the fundamental slice-of-life nature of the game I'm very happy with - slice-of-life gaming has potential, even if the games tend to suffer from difficulties in motivating you to actually play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449766">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Starblazie" title="Starblazie"><img alt="Starblazie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Starblazie">Starblazie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449766/#Comment_449766" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-26T02:57:32+00:00" title="November 26, 2015  2:57AM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 26, 2015 2:59AM by Starblazie.">edited November 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for your response.  You offer up some really fabulous ideas and I will be referring to your response often. I'm especially taken with using the actual forms as character sheets. Brilliance!  In the States, these would be things like applications for food stamp, housing assistance, and other various and sundry DHS offerings(Department of Human Services) forms.  <br/><br/>I will also be checking out Death's Door. <br/><br/>You make a very valid point about game play, and I'm already struggling with it. I can only see myself being a GM for about 10 of these games before I'd start losing my enthusiam.  A GMless system might make more sense for the game setting that I want to create. <br/><br/>But for the setting and the audience this really does need to be a no-win scenario. The way I think I want it to work is have the participants play the game once.  Then we take a break and have a group discussion on obstacles facing the disadvantaged in this country. This game is really meant to foster awareness and create a framework for discussion.  Here in the States, the plight of the poor and people of color is much more grim.  There are no safety nets here and government aid is inadequate and only available on the short term.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449767">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449767/#Comment_449767" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-26T03:08:11+00:00" title="November 26, 2015  3:08AM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>we used real social services forms as character sheets</blockquote>Total awesomeness, right there.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449768">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449768/#Comment_449768" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-26T03:48:12+00:00" title="November 26, 2015  3:48AM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>we used real social services forms as character sheets</blockquote>Total awesomeness, right there.<br/></blockquote>\nBrilliant!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449769">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449769/#Comment_449769" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-26T03:54:07+00:00" title="November 26, 2015  3:54AM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You should check out how games like Cthulhu Dark and Ghost Lines handle no-win situations.

As many others have mentioned, the form-filling process of character creation in Eero's post is absolutely brilliant in setting the mood and creating an insight into a particular character's plight.<br/><br/>Some other comments:<br/><br/>* There have been quite a few games written in this general genre (sometimes jokingly referred to as "misery tourism" - and, although here the aim is quite different, presumably the game design itself would be fairly similar). So it seems there is an audience for people who enjoy the process of playing the games, despite comments in this thread about such games having limited replay appeal. (Then again, maybe the people loving those games only played them once, who knows!)<br/><br/>* I think making the game entirely hopeless and terrible might be an error. While it's good to present the difficulty of these people's lives and the hopelessness of their situations, the games might be a lot more attractive and gripping if there is an occasional chance of success or escape from horrible circumstances. (I think the game can still portray its themes quite effectively, and it's possible to create a design where even "positive" outcomes are fairly grim and/or costly.) This can result in more replayability and more fun playing, which means more people playing the game and more engagement.<br/><br/>I'll point to a few other things in this vein:<br/><br/>* One game that comes to mind in this genre is <a href="http://www.halfmeme.com/nicotinegirls.html" rel="nofollow">Nicotine Girls</a>, which is free and you might wish to check out.<br/><br/>* Another two games which play with hopeless themes and disempowerment are Grey Ranks and Kagematsu, not free but definitely worth taking a look.<br/><br/>* I wonder if My Life with Master could be hacked to suit your purposes, as well?<br/><br/>* A few years ago, a group of designers involved with "this" community (whatever that may be) were hired by Nike Foundation to design and play games with young women in Ethiopia: "[worked] for the Nike Foundation to help hundreds of adolescent girls learn teamwork, financial literacy, and to speak out against gender based violence."<br/><br/>The project was, as far as I heard, extremely well-met and effective.

I wonder if perhaps way to handle the grimness of the game is to institute better social safety nets halfway through the game ala the U.K. and the Scandanavian countries.   I think it could be implemented using the narrative of the game (i.e., the President and Congress have decided to accomplish real welfare reform...).   It might be nice to contrast the differences, and yet still maintain some realism. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449774">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449774/#Comment_449774" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-26T22:49:09+00:00" title="November 26, 2015 10:49PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 26, 2015 10:49PM by Paul_T.">edited November 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That seems rather heavy-handed to me (and limits the scope of your game). <br/><br/>I could see something like a mechanism which kicks in at some point during that game which asks the players (perhaps as a group) to explore a change in circumstances (of which welfare reform could be an example, but could be other things as well, like a war breaking out, or the characters suddenly awakening to newfound self-esteem, or a heavy-handed political party coming into power with a specific agenda, like an opposition to legalizing sex work, or whatever seems interesting to the group).<br/><br/>Then, the further play of the game would allow the players to determine whether this change impacts the characters positively, and whether it allows them to change their lives for the better.

I would hope to never be that presumptuous and please smack me with a stick if you think I'm out of line. Please! And thank you!<br/><br/>If it helps, before I even posted here,  I did tell my friend that I would like to reach out to an activist she knows.  I should mention that he is a former Black Panther and has been very supportive of her work.  <br/><br/>And please no suggestions regarding a game involving the Black Panthers. I don't want to navigate that cultural appropriation minefield. Ever. <br/><br/>And perhaps I should have clarified earlier that the target audience for the game is white and many fall firmly within the middle class.  <br/><br/>But it sounds like I have a few options.  I apologize if it sounds like I missed some points or glossed over some others.  I'm still digesting and mulling over.  I think I would also like a couple of different frameworks in mind before I start reaching out. <br/><br/>Even if I choose to make the game a mostly no-win scenario (or misery tourism as Paul_T put it) it should be one that the players can "win."  Even if the mechanics of the game make the win costly and/or still grim. <br/><br/>Regardless of which framework I come up with, it sounds like many people here see player directed play as always better.<br/><br/><br/>Or I could make the game more freeform like a simulation ala Star Power.   There is a facilitator who decides whether the group has to act collectively or separately in groups, but the players themselves direct the gameplay and develop the rules. <br/><br/>I've also run across some sociological papers in regards to building a social awareness through game play and simulation.  I found one using a simple monopoly hack, but the facilitator still defines the rules.  If anyone is interested, I'll be happy to post the links as some of them are made available for free to the public. <br/><br/>It looks like my friend and I have many options and we will just need to sit down and start reading and working to clarify what our intent really is with this game. <br/><br/>edited to note: I also find myself liking the idea of creating social stratification without explicity calling in race and/or economic levels.  And it may be that my friend and I first utilize some existing games out there first to gain some experience and then go from there. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449779">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Starblazie" title="Starblazie"><img alt="Starblazie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Starblazie">Starblazie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449779/#Comment_449779" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-27T19:24:13+00:00" title="November 27, 2015  7:24PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 27, 2015 7:26PM by Starblazie.">edited November 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hit the wrong button and thought I was editing my former post instead of creating a whole new one.

If you make <i>great</i> success achievable, then you break authenticity, but if you make <i>only paltry</i> success achievable, you make it pointless and unplayable.  So if I were you, I'd put my energy into creating those sweet spot situations where the best we can achieve may not sound great by the player's standards but is still <i>way</i> better than failure.  <br/><br/><i>Steal Away Jordan</i> is quite strong in this regard, a game that's about striving to better one's lot as a slave (as opposed to wallowing in how awful slavery is, or heroically ending slavery).  You have assets and resources and cool things you're good at, just as in any other RPG, but then on top of that you have an in-setting structure around you that allows and restricts your behavior based on your dollar value.<br/><br/>I'll also note that having a GM apply the screws to the characters isn't the only way to go.  You can mechanize the various influences the characters face, from internal things like hope and faith to needs like money.  These can all be tracked game quantities if you like.

But then, that's my taste in <i>every</i> RPG.  <br/><br/>If you were extremely decisive with all your pre-game and in-game character choices and you kept your scenes short and to the point, I imagine you might be able to conclude a Dog Eat Dog game in 2 hours or so.<br/><br/>As far as one-shot RPGs go, it certainly isn't a particularly long game by default.
