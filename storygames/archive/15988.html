There's a Turtle Module for That Guy, which includes cards that say things like "Search for a trap" and "Hit the closest enemy creature". We'd create an AI that covers his character's actions whenever the player doesn't/can't respond to a prompt from the GM or another player, and it would be charitably written so the character would still get saving throws and take reasonable defensive actions.<br/><br/>The beauty of Turtle Mod is that it doesn't even require the player's physical presence. You can send him to do errands and make himself useful to the group in other ways when he begins to disengage with the story, as he no longer has to arrive or leave on time.<br/><br/>``Abel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_363934">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363934/#Comment_363934" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-29T13:02:22+00:00" title="February 29, 2012  1:02PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some further thoughts:<br/><br/>a) Functional game design based on lessened participation. This could be interesting!<br/><br/>I've heard of some cool games, for instance, where people contribute only small details or make occasional decisions by not being present at the table 100% of the time. For instance, you're playing a game in room A. I'm playing a different game in room B (or doing the dishes, or whatever). I make decisions for a certain character (maybe a major NPC?) in your game. When you need to know something about what they're doing, you send someone to room B to ask me what that is, or what I think about it.<br/><br/>Could be an interesting way to include a "distant boss" character or similar, like Charlie in Charlie's Angels. For a player who wants to mainly watch, they could be at the table with us and participating occasionally in this limited way.<br/><br/>b) A method for introducing beginners or shy people to certain games.<br/><br/>I'm skeptical of this one: RPGs aren't such amazingly complex things that you benefit from sitting and watching for a long time before you start playing "for real", but maybe some people would like it. The idea is that you get to play the game, but with limited input. You slowly learn the game and increase your creative input as you go, maybe session by session, or as you learn sub-components of the rules ("You've now learned how spellcasting works. From now on you can speak up at any time to cast a spell..."), or whatever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_363936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB" title="PeterBB"><img alt="PeterBB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB">PeterBB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363936/#Comment_363936" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-29T13:04:07+00:00" title="February 29, 2012  1:04PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 29, 2012 1:05PM by PeterBB.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've totally played that game, it was awesome.<br/><br/>It was a World of Darkness game using an (extensive) hack of the Shadowrun rules. The GM had a pretty fun adventure planned out (we fought the ghost of Michael Jackson, and had to deal with Hell-Nazis), and he explained where we were and what we were doing. Then we just had combats, where I got to use my cool powers like "bend darkness" and "supernaturally intimidating" to do stuff like walk down a staircase of shadows with my cape billowing behind me, as everyone in the combat froze and stared. I never made an important decision that game (our bosses told us where to go, and what to do), and the combats were designed so that we would win them, but I got to make my guy do cool things, and it was cool.<br/><br/>EDIT: I don't think I'm a "that guy" most of the time. I really dig more participatory games, and actually end up GMing more than I play. But I've definitely turtled before, and I've definitely played fun games where I didn't do much.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364061">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King" title="Double King"><img alt="Double King" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King">Double King</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364061/#Comment_364061" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-29T19:20:56+00:00" title="February 29, 2012  7:20PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>And they sit behind screen doors, so you don't have to see them.<a id="Item_4" name="Item_4"></a></blockquote>\nlike a peep show?  lol.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364097">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364097/#Comment_364097" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-01T03:24:08+00:00" title="March  1, 2012  3:24AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David: I like your basic idea, but I need to mention that this is not exactly everybody in Ron's "That Guy" group you're addressing here. Doesn't matter for the purposes of this thread, but it might get confusing with the other one if we decided that Ron's talking only about passive introverts with little ability for participating. Those are some of the people in the unsatisfied-gamers group, but many others are simply bound by unfunctional play habits and mismatched games and/or play groups. I'd even say that Ron's writing primarily about/for the latter type, as they are people who'll be most benefited by "system matters" and other such discipline. The passive introverts, on the other hand, will be happy as long as they get to participate and the play is entertaining.<br/><br/>But as said, that's not functionally important for this design case. The basic idea is solid, and I believe that it would work well with players who want low-performance gaming. I meet these people now and then, and have learned to play eg. Shadow of Yesterday with them by assigning them into clear dramatic support roles where they get to immerse in their characters and do what the actual protagonists tell them to do. And of course a game like D&amp;D, that handles them automatically, as they can just be part of the party and execute what plans the other players make up. In general, you want a flow of play that will continue and develop even without any particular player stepping up and being creative and smart.<br/><br/>Definitely a common type of roleplayer, this: I'd estimate it as one of the most important demographic classifications for myself that about half of the gamer population in Finland seems to rather like it if there are other, more active people in the group who can do the real work so they can be spectators.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364142">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364142/#Comment_364142" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-01T07:15:53+00:00" title="March  1, 2012  7:15AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've played a few intense double blind war games.

She also has a pet monkey. <br/>My impulse with players is to engage, elicit a response, and then react to that response, and repeat. With Boo, I try to sort of put interesting things in her path, and she just looks at them and then goes home.<br/>Firefight in the marketplace? Boo runs home to keep from getting hurt.<br/>Someone's being attacked by mutants on the outskirts of town? Boo tells the local Chopper and then goes home where it's safe.<br/><br/>It's almost like Boo is really an NPC haha but for starters, I've become cool with it. She honestly just doesn't want/desire/ask for very much screen time, and yet, at the same time, she really likes the mechanics of AW - - this isn't a question of her feeling like she's got too much power/ability to change the game; it's more that she just doesn't want to use the power afforded her as a player that often.<br/>She'd rather watch the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Gunlugger</span> whoops he's dead now and the Chopper get into it, and then patch them up with Healing Touch when they come home with extra holes. When I had an NPC go after Boo directly with a gun, she grabbed her stun-gun and tazed the guy until he was starting to seize, and then guarded him til the Chopper came by and shot him dead. <br/><br/>It's like Boo is simply interested in a lower level of the excitement and challenge of being a PC, but she's still into it. She'd just rather doodle on her playbook a lot of the time, and listen in on the other characters getting into shenanigans.
