The PBF version uses a 17-sided die, which fortunately we happen to have: &lt;roll&gt;1d17&lt;/roll&gt;.<br/><br/>THE GAME IS PLAYED by taking an "INLET" text, considering it as a "SIGNAL", and putting it through a random series of transformations or "FILTER GATES" until arriving at an "OUTLET" text (which happens when someone rolls "Save" on the d17), whereupon the game is done.<br/><br/>TO TAKE A TURN, make a post in which you do nothing but roll the d17.  Consult the table below for your filter gate.  Then post again, typing the name of your move in CAPS and then run the signal through that filter gate (i.e. perform the indicated transformation on the text).  Note that this is a cumulative procedure, so each person will be acting on the state of the signal which was left behind by their immediate predecessor.<pre><b>TABLE OF FILTER GATES:</b><br/>1 = CONTROL<br/>2 = DECAY<br/>3 = DRUG<br/>4 = ENHANCE<br/>5 = EXPLODE<br/>6 = FIND STORY<br/>7 = GHOST EDIT<br/>8 = INCREASE SENSE<br/>9 = MIX<br/>10 = OVERLOAD<br/>11 = PLAY GAME<br/>12 = PURIFY<br/>13 = RANDOMIZE<br/>14 = RELEASE VIRUS<br/>15 = SAMPLE<br/>16 = SEARCH &amp; REPLACE<br/>17 = SAVE<br/></pre>\n<b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOTES:</span> </b><br/>1. No one may make two moves in a row.<br/>2. If "Save" is rolled on the first turn, replace the INLET text with a new one.<br/><div><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DEFINITIONS:</span></b><br/><br/>INLET - The start-up text. The initial signal on which the device will act.<br/><br/>OUTLET - The final result of the filtering process.<br/><br/>SIGNAL - The text itself, as it passes through all its filter gates.<br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">FILTER GATES:</span></b><br/><br/>CONTROL - Brings the text down to earth. Forces language to behave itself.<br/><br/>DECAY - Gently breaks down the text. Dissipates. Introduces corruption to the signal.<br/><br/>DRUG - Injects artificial stimulant into the language. Type of drug will always be specified.  (e.g. Anagramethane, Metaphorazine, Fecundamol) <br/><br/>ENHANCE - Creates elements of beauty.<br/><br/>EXPLODE - Breaks up signal into highly disordered fragments. To be used with caution.<br/><br/>FIND STORY - Forces text into the nearest possible narrative, however nonsensical.<br/><br/>GHOST EDIT - Kills the text. Calls up a ghost to haunt the language.<br/><br/>INCREASE SENSE - Significantly enhances text. Increases readability.<br/><br/>MIX - Combines all elements into a single entity.<br/><br/>OVERLOAD - Drastically increases image density of text. To be used with caution.<br/><br/>PLAY GAME - Mischief maker. Encourages craziness. Results may surprise the user.<br/><br/>PURIFY - Loses deadwood. Selects images or phrases from the text.<br/><br/>RANDOMIZE - Disorders text. Parts of text may be lost or changed.<br/><br/>RELEASE VIRUS - Attacks text, changing words of choice into others of a similar sound. Recommended for advanced users.<br/><br/>SAMPLE - Introduces new element to signal. Source of sample to be specified.<br/><br/>SEARCH &amp; REPLACE - Uses machine function to introduce new elements to text. Elements always specified. For example, 'Search and Replace: day with night.'<br/><br/>SAVE - Denotes that the OUTLET text has been attained and the Cobralingus device has been deactivated.  End of game.<br/></div><br/><hr/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442559/#Comment_442559" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-06T08:46:32+00:00" title="February  6, 2015  8:46AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>INLET:</b><br/>Dorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, with Uncle Henry, who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the farmer's wife. Their house was small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon many miles. There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one room; and this room contained a rusty looking cookstove, a cupboard for the dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and the beds. Uncle Henry and Aunt Em had a big bed in one corner, and Dorothy a little bed in another corner. There was no garret at all, and no cellar--except a small hole dug in the ground, called a cyclone cellar, where the family could go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose, mighty enough to crush any building in its path. It was reached by a trap door in the middle of the floor, from which a ladder led down into the small, dark hole. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442560">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442560/#Comment_442560" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-06T09:08:13+00:00" title="February  6, 2015  9:08AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>(Rolled: 1d17.
