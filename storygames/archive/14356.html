A new member of the club, on his first visit, managed to acquit himself admirably; his Sonar Operator was aghast to see the Cabin Boy being seduced by a female stowaway... the Pilot's mother!<br/>\n<br/>\nWithin an hour, we had emptied the deck and most questions had at least three cards placed on them by now, so we went to the endgame:<br/>\n<b>Vampires Are Not Real:</b> It turned out all the strangeness and death had a mundane explanation...<br/>\n<b>There Will Be Bloodshed:</b> This didn't stop the Political officer from losing his mind though and staking the Captain through the heart!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fiction we'd built dovetailed nicely with the card draws for the questions and worked nicely with everyone's final fate; the Captain was posthumously honoured for his sacrificice(he drew red), which turned out to have nothing to do with the Americans: it was actually a training exercise! (The Sonar Operator drew black) The Political Officer went off to the gulag and the Cabin Boy was lost to sea along with the Pilot's mother (they all drew black) but the Cook managed to get away with his murder, return to land and get a pay rise! (Yes, he drew a red that was lower than his status)<br/>\n<br/>\nOne change I made to the rules was that, when you drew cards in a scene, you selected one to answer the question in the scene but a different one went into the target pile: this way, nobody else knew what you had played onto a pile (except the target player when tackiling another character's question). This also resolved a problem with Court cards chaning your status when played to resolve a scene but having no relationship to status when drawn from a pile in the endgame.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_326269">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil" title="Neil"><img alt="Neil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil">Neil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326269/#Comment_326269" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-25T05:37:13+00:00" title="May 25, 2011  5:37AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            James,<br><br>Thanks for the playtest last night. It played out similarly to how I thought it might go from reading the rules.<br><br>I think it suffers from a problem described by Vincent's clouds, dice, and arrows. In BDC, the mechanics influence the fiction (card draws determine the answers to the scene questions), but there's no way for the fiction to influence the mechanics. Good roleplay, fictional positioning, reincorporating setting elements, none of those affects the card draw and scene resolution.<br><br>That led to the occasions in the game where people didn't really bother with much narration, but just cut straight to the card draw. The fictional description didn't matter, so it was ignored.<br><br>(In contrast, <i>A Taste for Murder</i> [which we played afterwards] has the black and white dice, which are really worth playing for. That makes people spend some time narrating before the mechanics are engaged.)<br><br>I'm not sure what to do about it. You could take inspiration from <i>Covenant</i> and have some defined Themes and Motifs. If a player brings them into a scene, they get extra cards. It might also keep the gonzo tendencies in check.<br><br>That implies opposed resolution, as several people vie to claim the limited Theme cards (or whatever). That's good, as it goads people into doing a better job of narrating. Also, opposed resolution anyway isn't necessarily a bad thing.<br><br>Incidentally, what's wrong with bringing the discards back into play if needed? Even with five players, having three cards on each question will use up just under half the deck.<br><br>The other issue was scene framing. As characters can address their own questions, and the resolution of those questions is independent, there was no particular need for the PCs' paths to cross. I could just spend my time in my own little corner, playing a few solo scenes, and answer my own question.<br><br>How about each person gets to frame a scene in turn, but that scene must contain at least two PCs? Going further, perhaps mandate that my PC cannot be in the scenes I frame? Maybe the choice of PCs should be limited somehow to prompt including the PCs with fewest cards on their question. It might also be an idea to have other players influence, if not determine, the answers to other PCs' questions.<br><br>Finally, I don't know if it just didn't come up, but who gets narration rights after the card draw, with either success or failure? What about when trying to resolve one of the central questions?<br><br/>Hope that's useful.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_326359">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326359/#Comment_326359" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-25T13:31:27+00:00" title="May 25, 2011  1:31PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the prompt feedback Neil; those are some good observations that have spurred me to give the game more guidance on narrative rights and an overhauled system for resolving scenes, which now requires an opposed conflict with another character. There's a bit of back and forth and some stratgeic play, as players assess when is the best time to act and whether they will be better off giving in to their opponent's demands or pushing for their own agenda. Each side stands to gain red or black cards for their questions, depending on what cards are played and who wins, with some conflicts also creating a 'spare' card that the loser must assign to one of the shared questions, with some appropriate colour narration.<br/>\n<br/>\nA new revision of the game is available on my website, <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.groundhoggoth.co.uk/images/stories/games/behind_drawn_curtains.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
