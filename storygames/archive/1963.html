                            It should note that the entire Ends and Means part of the game, is Adam Cerling's System; which means modififying that needs his permission, not mine.<br/><br/>And don't forget the : The Fallout  (it's important!)<br/><br/>I'll enclose the Sanctum: The Fallout, Requirements, here.<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/><br/>The World of Sanctum: Starting out.<br/><br/><br/>The world of Sanctum is as simple or as complicated as it is made to be. Sanctum itself is a modify-it-yourself setting that follows a few simple rules. As long as you follow these rules, you are playing Sanctumâ€¦Deviate, and you are not. Once you have these conditions met, The world is your own. Break it, Bend it, Guide it, Plot it...there ARE no rules to what you can or can't do with Sanctum: the Fallout, unless you decide you want it that way. I'm not going to tell you "No, it doesn't exist, or No, it has to follow this fate" <br/><br/>â€¢ The world consists of cities. The number, type and size of these cities are not determined until you determine them. The gameâ€™s focus usually begins with focus on a single city, and this is the city that your player characters exist in. There is nothing that says you must create more than one city, and there is nothing to say that you cannot create several hundred; do what is best for your own game.<br/><br/>â€¢ Each City has a theme. Decide what that theme is, and then create the characters. It could be a theme as simple as â€œEveryone is from New York but from different periods of time.â€, From the elaborate â€œEveryone is an ordinary human from random places on earth, are from different points in time and all were in the process of dying in a catastrophic eventâ€ Itâ€™s your worldâ€¦choose it, or better yet, let the players decide what kind of world they want to experience.<br/><br/>â€¢ The cities of Sanctum are defined by the people who occupy them; this is important. The city is what you get when you take elements from everyone and everything that occupy your characterâ€™s familiarity and mix them all together. If you took two purebred dogs and bred them together, youâ€™d get a muttâ€¦this is exactly what you are doing with the city. The city is the result of all of those elements trying to merge together, or co-exist. Nothing says that you have to include all of those elements, but nothing says you canâ€™t try!<br/><br/>â€¢ Each city is Unique. It does not matter what theme is devised, or how many cities you have, but each city is absolutely Unique. If one city is ordinary humans from the planet earth, there must be a fundamental difference in the next city. It can be as small as that everyone in a particular city is a child, or as large as every person who exists is actually a fictional storybook character who is not only real, but lived out their lives just the same as anyone else. (can you imagine the shock THEY must have had the morning after they woke?) <br/><br/>â€¢ Each city stands alone. Regardless of how long it takes to get to another city, the method of getting there, or how easy or difficult it is to get to another place, each city is essentially alone, or holds the appearance of being that way. Perhaps there is a glass mirror or wall that is an illusion and that a hallway to another city exists through that mirror, or there could be a portal that opens every sunrise to allow people passageway, but each city should act almost as if it were itâ€™s own world. Whatever reasons you create for explaining it, abusing it or using it are up to you, as long as it exists.<br/><br/>â€¢ The city started on the same day. It doesnâ€™t matter if someone doesnâ€™t remember it, overslept that day or simply didnâ€™t realize anything had changed because they were too busy hiding in their closet; Sanctum began at the same time for everyone in that city. This does not mean the game has to start on the same day as Sanctumâ€™s creation; you can start before, or even well after, but as far as the storyline goes, there was a single day that it all â€˜happenedâ€™.                        </div>

                            I don't mind you trying to play-test Sanctum, but I think you may be going about the attempt in the wrong way.<br/><br/>This may be the wrong place to find players, and it's my suggestion that you find a group first, then discuss what kind of world you want to play; then overlap it with sanctum.    I was thinking that you already had something, or a group in mind when you asked.<br/><br/>Sara                        </div>
