I'd like to write some setting books about historical periods that interest me: Victorian times, Georgian times and so forth.<br/><br/>The problem is, historical setting books can be dull. You get a page on equipment, a page on transport and a page on I'm sorry I lost interest halfway through typing this sentence. At their worst, they read like Wikipedia articles.<br/><br/>They get better when the history is interesting. So not just, say, a chapter on Victorian transport, but a chapter on Victorian spiritualism. Or the Victorian love of sensation. Or Victorian homicides. Give me any of those things and ideas for games start sparking.<br/><br/>So how would you do a historical setting book? I'd like to write something that provokes ideas, that makes you think "I'd love to play that through in a game". (That, after all, is what history does to me, and I'd like to write something that shares my enthusiasm.)<br/><br/>Do think, particularly, about what kind of book <i>you'd</i> find interesting. For example, I sort of feel I should find a book of scenario ideas and situations interesting. But I wouldn't. I want to read a list of historical nuggets and invent my own ideas.<br/><br/>So what should a historical setting book be like?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325718/#Comment_325718" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-22T18:14:33+00:00" title="May 22, 2011  6:14PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd want to know about various beliefs and social relationships. <br/><br/>Particularly, a day/week/year in the life of person of social class x, y or z is helpful to me.

Professional historians are invited to present in 5 minutes one person they discovered in archive records and probably nobody ever heard of before. It may be modern, medieval, antiquity... Sometimes the choice illustrates a matter of Historiography. Sometimes it's just someone who had an astonishing destiny. Quite often it paints indirectly a very interesting picture of the society they lived in.<br/><br/>I think I would love to find something a little bit like that in a historical RPGs setting book. A few paragraphs dedicated to real people who can both be inspiration for NPCs and shade a special light that goes beyond clich\xe9s and general rules. Bonus point if they migrated, changed social circles, had ups and downs etc.. Monarchs, ministers, generals and other celebrities need not apply.

If I were really interested in Victorian transport, and was designing a campaign about two rival hansom cab companies, or a dude trying to get railroad track laid through a sleepy Scottish village, I'd want the former and not the latter. You can't say one is objectively better than another, it's just what your taste is and what my taste is.  Like, I could really give a shit about the love of sensation compared to railroads and cabs. I studied late-19th-century-Paris' cabs when I was putting together my Victorian adventure game recently, it was pretty interesting, with colored lanterns and protection rackets and such.  But I can't convince you or anyone to like it more or less, it's just taste.<br/><br/>So let's just back up a little here. I think the identification of <i>situation</i> in a setting supplement is right on the nose. This is why the Forgotten Realms 3rd Edition guide is so terrific. There literally is not a single page that doesn't scream "HEY THIS IS A FUCKING PROBLEM THAT REQUIRES A MAGICAL WANDERING ROCKSTAR TO COME IN AND SOLVE".

Since fictionalized Hollywood (or whereever) History tends to have quick sketch visuals and also jump to core setting conflicts and tidbits I tend to prefer them as a jumping off point.<br/><br/>I guess you could also give a related list of books to act as an antidote to ahistorical stuff seen in a film also, or to give some further understanding of a situation.<br/><br/>With my ongoing flirtation with putting together a WW2 Resistance Game, I watched a ton of films in that setting. Aux Revoir Les Enfants has a scene where Milice show up at a restaurant and cause trouble. Flame and Citron and It Happened Here! ( a highly fictionalized alt.history film) both have bits where locally raised Waffen SS troops are involved. Army of Crime has a ton to do with police collaboration with occupying forces. All of those films would make great jumping off points for discussion of the sort of internal threats to resistance organizations and their foreign agent (SOE,OSS) allies. Charlotte Gray, Wish Me Luck (TV Series), Secret Army, annd even 'All, 'Allo dip into discussions about the tensions and betrayals involved with trying to co-ordinate the activities of Right Wig and Left Wing resistance groups. Island at War is all about the slow descent into collaboration and the slow build up of resistance in all its forms. <br/><br/>The Sorrow and The Pity hits basically all of those, too.<br/><br/>Frankly, none of those sorts of things were much discussed in my high school history classes on the period. I wouldn't count them as common knowledge by any stretch, but they all have a ton to do with any game in that sort of setting+ situation. I'd say it's decidedly easier to start with the film/tv representaton of those things, then work back to readings.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_325811">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325811/#Comment_325811" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-23T07:22:33+00:00" title="May 23, 2011  7:22AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would want the book to come with guidelines for generating situations that feel right for that time period, like the town creation guidelines in Dogs in the Vineyard or the front/threat creation rules in Apocalypse World or the oracles from In a Wicked Age (sorry, three Vincent games, but he's really at helping you generate situation).

I really like the Kaiin Player's Guide and The Investigators Guide to Occult London from Pelgrane. Both can but put in the hands of the players to give inspiration for the characters backgrounds, contacts and investigations (the second one even more so as it's an in world artifact too). To a certain extent, these are story books, they tell unfinished stories set in the game world and challenge the players (and GM) to finish them. Being stories, they provide context, theme and style without the infodump that comes from a strict setting book. Stories are infectious, much more so than facts. The Dictionary of Mu works in the same way.<br/><br/>When I'm GMing in history, I tend to pick a date and place and look on wikipedia for links to those things. This always sparks some interest. I then get pictures related to these and share them with the players. So a big book of pictures for players with facts for the GM would work as well for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_325828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WillH" title="WillH"><img alt="WillH" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v488/Telpierion/minitardisicon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WillH">WillH</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325828/#Comment_325828" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-23T08:56:44+00:00" title="May 23, 2011  8:56AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Graham, someone wrote a really nifty game about a murder in an English country estate between the two world wars.

They are not really relevant for a story gaming approach, in which setting is connected to the situation of the characters, but (say) for sandbox games they're great.  You don't have to work out who might find the body in the alley, the game material tells you.  You don't have to make up some new character off the top of your head who works in the diner, the game material tells you.  It's a big advantage for that kind of "nonfictional" kind of play.  The next step in that direction is not to make it less detailed, but instead to leverage technology to make it more detailed.  Imagine you had a Daggerdale supplement on a tablet or on a laptop.  You punch in what time of day it is and the tablet tells you where everyone is and what they're doing when the goblins attack or the evil wizzard launches a fireball.  It would make timing crucial and most of all, very interesting.<br/><br/>But yeah, the Arkham Massachusetts/Kingsport, City In the Mists type of Call of Cthulhu sourcebooks are really not much use for a story oriented person except as a collection of scenario hooks.<br/><br/>That's not a bad thing, scenario hooks are a good thing. Which leads me to this:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>Would you actually use this? I know that I never use scenario seeds like this: I want to get creative and invent my own.</blockquote>\nI think the reason the Big Thick History Book is common is because the expectation is that we will make our own game with it.  In other words, the designer/writer doesn't know whether we're going to be occult dabblers, secret agents for the Church holding the line against spiritualist madmen, or ghosts.  So he has to spread his situation-material very thin across lots of setting facts.<br/><br/>Whereas (for example) the old splatbook formulation started from a point of view - you are going to be <i>this kind of character</i> and here's a shitload of stuff about the kinds of things that kind of character does in this kind of setting. <br/><br/>Some games have such a clear core story that there really is no point in going into great detail about situation in a supplement. Cthulhu Gaslight doesn't contain anything about how to play Call of Cthulhu.  It's all setting, we know what we're going to be doing in Gaslight, we're going to investigate, and cultists will shoot at us, and we will blow up the monster with magic and dynamite or whatever.<br/><br/>So that's why I propose the "point of view" setting material book.  Sure, I might want to come up with things on my own - in that case, you probably won't sell your book to me, but in that case, the only kind of book that will give me what I want IS the big hefty broad-based thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325921">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch" title="Will_Hindmarch"><img alt="Will_Hindmarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.wordstudio.net/coffee_ring-32px.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch">Will_Hindmarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325921/#Comment_325921" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-23T14:06:52+00:00" title="May 23, 2011  2:06PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (By the way, I've posted about this question at <a href="http://www.gameplaywright.net" rel="nofollow">Gameplaywright</a> and a few answers are trickling in.

There was no mains electricity (at least, no National Grid), so radios had batteries. You took them to the local garage to be recharged.<br/><br/>A surprisingly important thing is: what was commonly used? In 1935, refrigerators and electric light had been invented, but neither were common. The motor car had been invented, but you still saw horses on the road.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_326007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326007/#Comment_326007" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-23T19:07:37+00:00" title="May 23, 2011  7:07PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It should be like Tales of the Caliphate Nights.

That strikes a nice balance between practical information and highlighting interesting and distinctive elements about the neighborhood.  Plus, it challenges the writer to be engaging.<br/><br/>While using "Chelsea:  The home of the Chelsea Flower Show" is dull when describing the neighborhood, it is important to remember to include descriptions of festivals.  All too often, our games take place outside any reference to religious or cultural festivals that would inform the lives of people in the setting.  Think of how the Day of the Dead is used for context and color in Under the Volcano or think of almost any Christmas movie that you've ever seen.
