One guy buys a big book of rules and another big book of setting information. The first guy reads through both big books thoroughly and writes a plot and a series of encounters that makes use of as much of the information from both books as possible to run some characters through. Then he gets a bunch of other guys together and, first, instructs them as thoroughly as possible about the contents of the setting book, then has each of them make a character according to the methods outlined in the rulebook. These characters are then run through the plot the first guy came up with and, if it's a hit, that guy will then go on to write up another plot.<br/><br/>That, as I understand it, is how gamers are expected to pick up on new RPG's. And it simply does not work for me nor, as far as I can tell, does it work for any other gamers I know. It's a process that expects nearly all the effort of getting a session of play going to come from one person, the GM. It also demands that the GM serve as the lone aperture of a large amount of information, such that I have to wonder how much of those detailed campaign settings actually ever reach the game table. In terms of actual play, I've only ever been able to establish the broad strokes of a setting effectively, and fine details such as the particular names of all the mountain tribes never have a chance to appear or, as often as otherwise, are superseded by the improvised details that come up in play. I don't buy into "big-box" settings anymore because I know from experience that most of them will never be of any use to me. The same applies to rules systems. Light, quick and functional beats expansive and detailed every time since, even if I care to adjudicate something in particular focus, by the time I've looked up the rule I've probably house-ruled as good a solution anyway.<br/><br/>Increasingly, I'm seeing RPG's as something that works best "DIY and on the fly," a simple set of guideline rules, a few broad strokes of background (one page of text, some pictures) and a lot of improvisation at the table. I've begun thinking of RPG's as a group creative effort to be nurtured and grown, not a technically oriented script to be adhered to. Spares me a lot of work, too.<br/><br/>Which puts me at increasing odds with the rest of the hobby, or at least the commercial aspect of it. For instance, I think the concept of <i>Ars Magica</i> sounds neat, but I'll probably never buy into the gameline because I'll get no more use out of a new book than I would with just FATE, Wushu or Fudge and the phrase "you're a coven of wizards in medieval Europe". I can't even conceive of ever buying a D20 product again.<br/><br/>I am curious how many other folks here find that their tastes are evolving similarly, and how they relate to the rest of the hobby.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_74896">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74896/#Comment_74896" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-11T08:30:18+00:00" title="June 11, 2007  8:30AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I think that there is a growing community of people (many of whom are here at SG), who are with you as to how to play RPGs.

I just want to know about what they think and feel as they appear to enjoy playing in a way that I don't understand how to enjoy.

When I run games, I like to have enough control of a few scenes to "set them up", from practicing NPC voices, scoring some scenes I suspect will happen within the session, mapping stuff out for conflict scenes and the like<br>\n* I like having a reference document to skim between sessions to spark ideas or give me different looks on situations or help me to reincorporate player actions or concerns into the Big Picture (and many players like the Big Picture to come from a big ole setting book)<br/>\n* With a traditional RPG, I have stuff to keep me imagining between sessions, background tasks that entertain me away from the table.  In an indie game where everything happens at the table, I don't know where to put that energy.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_74927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74927/#Comment_74927" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-11T10:54:59+00:00" title="June 11, 2007 10:54AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I recently bought all the Eberron books (used).

So either you write it down ( in which case why not use someone else's notes if your short for time/ideas Ie a book is a book is a book doesn't matter if it's DIY or WOTC) or you sacrifice consistancy, which while okay with some people is a big stepping stone out of Immersion/creative agenda for alot of people. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis may work perferctly for you, but i can think of lots of people it wont ( myself for example) <br/>\n<br/>\nJust a thought<br/>\n<br/>\nL                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_75114">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Meserach" title="Meserach"><img alt="Meserach" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Meserach">Meserach</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75114/#Comment_75114" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-12T08:30:09+00:00" title="June 12, 2007  8:30AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Re: the big setting book. I honestly think this kind f thing works most effectively when the players have read the sourcebook also.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe, your players and the GM have a shared language of references, much like the cool feeling when you meet someone who likes the same movies as you do, and you can quote it back and forth. If your players have read the book, this means that by simply saying one name or another, you can immediately introduce a whole family of concepts and feelings related to that name, because they've all read about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSay, for example, there's a secret guild of assassins called the Red Hand. Sure you could run the campaign with the players knowing nothing, and have them pick up what they need to know about the Red Hand by having NPCs exposit at them over time. Or, you let them read the book, and then you can just drop references to the Red Hand freely. And as soon as you do, the players will immediately be like "Ooooh shit, the Red Hand!"<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is not with the books themselves, but with the advice which says that the players shouldn't read them, in order that they be surprised. But surprise is over-rated, and the idea of "stuff that is secret to the GM" equally so. Besides, people nearly always read that stuff anyway if they bought the book. Of course they do.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you're no letting the players read the book, then the book is much less useful, although it still provides an aid for creativity, a source of cool pictures and stats, and a go-to source when you desperately need an answer to a player who just went off in a an unexpected direction.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut far and away the best use of the setting book is to let the players read it, and then exult in the shared concepts you now have access to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_75124">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75124/#Comment_75124" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-12T09:06:39+00:00" title="June 12, 2007  9:06AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Meserach</cite>But far and away the best use of the setting book is to let the players read it, and then exult in the shared concepts you now have access to.</blockquote>\nTook the words right out of my mouth.<br><br>IMO, one of the main appeals of using a Big Setting Book\xe2\u201e\xa2 in the first place is that the world is a place you want to explore, i.e., you have immersion as an agenda in there somewhere. I can't imagine how that's supposed to happen effectively if the players are in the dark about all those off-screen details. E.g., in Eberron, not knowing who the Emerald Claw are and their real agenda makes an encounter with them just more faceless NPCs you kill. You'll never get the "The Emerald Claw is after us? Crap!" moment.<br><br>Anyway, I don't necessarily think the Big Setting Book\xe2\u201e\xa2 has to go hand-in-hand with the railroaded adventure plot. <i>Burning Empires</i> is probably a good example that you can have the cool setting <i>and</i> Story Now. And the Sons of Kryos have been running Eberron with SotC/FATE for many sessions now.<br><br>Otherwise, I'm very sympathetic to your position, E. I don't see it as a "lite"/"crunchy" divide as much as a "relevant"/"irrelevant" divide. Any system that goes into pornographic detail about minutiae <i>that is not relevant to play</i> is generally of little interest to me anymore. E.g., both FATE and D&amp;D rock my world, because, the way I play them at least, dice are constantly hitting the table. I.e., the rules support what we spend most of our time doing. Conversely, my beloved HERO (which I seem to bitching about constantly lately), sees the system come into play so rarely in our games that I can't really justify the effort anymore.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_75127">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75127/#Comment_75127" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-12T09:14:33+00:00" title="June 12, 2007  9:14AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another reason (one my group has stated) that improvved setting may not appeal is because it's inherently flimsy.

Simply, I have become intolerant of gaming literature, whether rules or setting, which does not have immediate value for play *now*. Multi-hundred page tomes of rules and background have become an unacceptable obstacle for my fun, and I suspect, after some observations of other games in progress that they have for others as well. While I understand that game literature can be entertaining in and of itself to read, frankly I think that has no bearing on its use at the table, and I'd rather spend my lesuire-reading time on "real" books, which in turn I find have more value at the game table in the end anyway (why read a space opera version of a faux Battle of Iwo Jima, with stat blocks, when I can read about the actual battle).<br/><br/>I find that a "DIY on the Fly" approach is working best for my games, where there's alot of room for improvisation and the story, the setting and the rules all grow over the course of play. Note, I am not advocating total improvisation, sitting down and starting from zero. I've tried that, and in the end it does not work. But I do like starting loose, with a rules framework (preferably one that can be explained completey with just a one-page character sheet) and a simple background overview (5 pages or less) and a handful of striking pictures to set the mood. <br/><br/>Aggravating matters is that the products put out by hobby game publishers are increasingly superfluous to my approach. Why would I pay forty dollars for a multi-hundred page book that I have every reason to believe will by 90% useless to me in play? I would much rather pay one or two bucks for five pages of setting or rules information at a time, downloaded when I need it. Harn used to be distrubuted in such a way, via a base set and a modular expandable rulebook, and I was always struck by how practical tat approach seemed. Frankly, the modular approah seems so superior and obvious to me I'm suprised no one has taken it up yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_75163">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75163/#Comment_75163" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-12T11:53:44+00:00" title="June 12, 2007 11:53AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: E.T.Smith</cite>Frankly, the modular approah seems so superior and obvious to me I'm suprised no one has taken it up yet.</blockquote>\nI'm guessing the higher profitability of multi-volume setting tomes has something to do with it.<br/><br/>That said, even the multi-volume setting tome can be a source for ideas that spur play. I think it was Jason, above, who posted a great thread on RPG.net where he listed something like 101 scenario seeds inspired solely by the main Forgotten Realms setting book (i.e., not looking at any of the supplements). And I think the aforementioned Sons of Kryos "Spirit  of Sharn" SotC game is taking inspiration from just the main Eberron book and running with it. It's all just about getting ideas from wherever you can.<br/><br/>Anyway, something to keep in mind is that it all depends on what you want out of gaming. If you want Story Now, yeah, phat setting books and supplements are potentially getting in your way. However, if you want to Be There, having a tall stack of data <i>waiting to be explored</i> is a good thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_75167">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75167/#Comment_75167" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-12T11:57:04+00:00" title="June 12, 2007 11:57AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 12, 2007 11:58AM by JDCorley.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It was indeed me.

I think there is a big problem with the way setting/plots are presented in our hobby, and doesn't fit our needs.<br/>You have many choices, but two that are mentionned by the OP :<br/>- buy setting and then <i>plots</i>. But what is that ? How come setting are separated from the plot ? Where (movie, books ...) else does it exists ? For me, a setting can't be separated from plots, they formed one thing !!! Otherwise, you come with some kind of constant setting, with no stakes !!! The setting doesn't move !!! Let's say I buy a setting where two countries are at the verge of war. When is it happening ? How ? What are the intrigues ? Those are immediate, high, stakes. Don't tell me this situation won't move and even less I have to buy a module to understand it !! Because when I have played it, the setting is still the same : two countries at the verge of war ...<br/>- buy books (normal one) and get inspiration from it. Well, the book (or movie, or whatever) is not meant, is not written for the purpose of rpg. Adaptation might become a big, big mess !!! And even so, more often than not, the story related in this media (could be firefly) is centered on main characters, and you don't necessarily want to play their exact plot ; so you might need some information that is absent ...<br/><br/><i>I'm</i> looking for a product that would relate to a story, from a very high point of view, giving a setting in the context of stakes (which means plots, how the stakes evolve), with as no details, only the minimum I need ; a kind of backbone, upon which I can build the games of my sessions. <i>I'm </i>looking for something I could use at 90%.\n<blockquote>Perhaps it would be helpful to talk about specific products? </blockquote>\nQuite franckly, I'm still looking for them !!! I'm currently working on this type of <a href="http://www.cycles-rpg.com" rel="nofollow">project</a>, but I don't see much others doing it !!! Any kind of prewritten plots means railroading for most people and they are somehow "dead". And I believe those kind of products would need a very, very specific design, an all new way to approach setting and plots (which, like I said, can't be separated according to me).<br/>My solution is to go thru some kind of "story board" : an unfinished product, meant to be completed by the users (DMs and PCs alike). But, I'm sure of it, this is not the only solution ...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_75273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75273/#Comment_75273" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-13T05:44:04+00:00" title="June 13, 2007  5:44AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dave Hallett</cite>Perhaps it would be helpful to talk about specific products?</blockquote>\nI've been running a Star HERO game recently, and I can tell you that, for example, the <i>Terran Empire</i> setting book is crammed to the gills with utterly play-irrelevant material.

If you go earlier, you've got an <i>Enterprise</i>-esque campaign about a nascent Earth founding a galactic civilization after a long and burtal galactic war. If you go later, you've got a corrupt, dying Terran empire facing the birth of a rebellion, i.e., <i>Star Wars</i><br/><br/>But in the present, you've got a strong empire that most citizens are happy with, no real external threats, and the internal threats are so young that none of the PCs likely know they exist.<br/><br/>It just boggles me.<br/><br/>Anyway, I think this all comes back to <a href="http://mearls.livejournal.com/97347.html" rel="nofollow">the great stuff Mearls said about core stories in D&amp;D</a>. Basically, any data in a product that is not relevant to what the product is trying to achieve is useless data. With setting material, I think this tends to be the little details many authors assume are necessary to make the illusion seem real. E.g., economics and trade data about towns in a fantasy setting, when the game's basic model features adventures that have nothing to do with economics or trade.<br/><br/>Then again, you'd be surprised by how many gamers out there want this data. I was reading an item on Gaming Report about upcoming releases for the new Star Wars Saga RPG from WotC, and it mentioned an upcoming starship sourcebook. Someone then posted a comment that they really hoped the book would include info on the economics of running a freighter. Which, honestly, was one of the most profoundly stupid requests for a <i>Star Wars</i> product I've ever seen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_75339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75339/#Comment_75339" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-13T09:34:20+00:00" title="June 13, 2007  9:34AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Smith: the way I play, this material isn't useful.<br/>\n<br/>\nCorely: the way I play, this material is useful.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's no disagreement here.

We both are excited by a promise of fantasy adventures.  Then we play D&amp;D, and counting coins and 10' squares and hit points breaks the fun for me, and not for you.

In movies, even though American action films dominate, other approaches are still known to exist and considered valid.

This is far, far from my preferred game.  We use it for my Skype/Maptool group because the guys with kids don't have time to learn a new game and want to stick with what they know really well.  And I love playing with these guys, so GURPS it is.<br/><br/>For those who don't know, GURPS is horrendously fussy and obsessed with matters of game balance.  Character creation is fiddly enough to require a computer.  There are hundreds of skills to choose from, many of which branch into narrow specializations and/or have complicated prerequisites.  There are many disadvantages, which are mostly enforced with a "roleplay this or be penalized" rule.  There are character quirks, which, as presented, are mostly things that influence the dead play between the start of the session and the presentation of the adventure hook. All this minutia is aimed at neutering the munchkin player and promoting "role playing," but none of my players are munchkins.  They don't have the time to be good at it, and they recoil at even the notion of such impropriety.  Really, on the surface, GURPS has absolutely nothing to offer my group.<br/><br/>So, awhile ago, I was looking over characters sheets and thinking about the upcoming adventure, when I realized that   <b>every GURPS character is pure flag soup!</b>  There's like 20-40 flags to a GURPS character and they're all tidily prioritized by their character point cost.  How can adventure design be hard with this kind of input?  So I tried picking three flags from each sheet and then structuring an adventure around that set, and bingo, instant better fun.<br/><br/>The climatic scene of our last session involved an Animal Handling roll -- one of our characters had a challenge vs. his alt-timeline NPC double over the loyalty of his/their dog.  The dog went with the NPC double, and it was A Big Moment with its alpha and omega in the clunky old GURPS mechanics.  Everyone was into it.  The post-game chatter was really upbeat.<br/><br/>I feel kind of embarrassed to admit this revelation, because it really ought to have been completely obvious to me in 1986 when I ripped the cellophane off my first GURPS Basic Set, but there it is for ya.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_75518">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75518/#Comment_75518" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-13T17:16:40+00:00" title="June 13, 2007  5:16PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 13, 2007 5:16PM by JDCorley.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't feel dumb, I played D&amp;D for yeears before figuring out "fucking a, I got a paladin and two clerics, maybe I should put some gods in this game, ya think??"<br/><br/>One thing that might help your next foray into GURPS is to cut down the skill/Advantage/Disadvantage list.

So I'd be, like, "Man, when I finally get to play again, I'm gonna do this, and this, and that, and this other thing and it's gonna be <i>awesome!</i>"<br/><br/>When things didn't go as I expected -- because there were, you know, <i>other human beings involved</i> -- I was invariably disappointed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_75606">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75606/#Comment_75606" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-14T08:06:46+00:00" title="June 14, 2007  8:06AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ron: Oh, lord yes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_75609">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickNovitski" title="NickNovitski"><img alt="NickNovitski" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/192/nO35O3RI2BE32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickNovitski">NickNovitski</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75609/#Comment_75609" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-14T08:27:15+00:00" title="June 14, 2007  8:27AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 14, 2007 8:27AM by NickNovitski.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite><br/>It's only later on, depending on many other factors, that this submerged conflict results in Awesome or Suck.</blockquote>\nMy current holy grail is the identifying of those factors.

obligated to point out that the system can be stripped waaaaay down if you want. For a while I ran it with, like, a dozen skills to choose from and almost all the complexity flensed from its weary bones.</blockquote>\nWhen we started our GURPS campaign, I was like "We're using Lite and Magic and that's it, because I am way too old to deal with 400 pages of rules anymore."  <br/><br/>But then, the Basic Set kinda crept in during the first session, during an unarmed combat.  "Just this one rule lookup," I told myself.  And with the nice searchable PDFs that I have, it is really easy to look up other rules too.  Now, ten sessions in, we run GURPS with the full advanced combat system, pretty much unflensed, and it runs pretty snappily.  (We're in the good part of the GURPS power curve, at about 130 points, so things haven't gotten stupid yet.)<br/><br/>I went through a long stretch of loving rules-light games that substituted GM judgment for rules -- things like Over the Edge, Star Wars d6, Castles &amp; Crusades, that kinda thing.  Now that the Forge and its diaspora have made me reconsider the role of the GM and the value of engaging mechanics, I'm finding that it's kinda nice having a rules system that'll arbitrate the controversial stuff in a detailed fashion.   If only the GURPS pre-play weren't so damn onerous...<br/><br/>So, to bring us back to the business of the thread: I guess I can't agree with the "It's a new hobby" sentiment.  All this stuff that happens online, this forge business and this story gaming and knife fighting and indie press revolution and whatnot, all of it has made gaming much better for me in a wide variety of situations, from hoary ol' GURPS to cutting-edge story-games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_75854">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/E.T.Smith" title="E.T.Smith"><img alt="E.T.Smith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1090/buddyicons/8542318@N07.jpg?1180909196"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/E.T.Smith">E.T.Smith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75854/#Comment_75854" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-15T08:02:29+00:00" title="June 15, 2007  8:02AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnzo</cite><br/>When we started our GURPS campaign, I was like "We're using Lite and Magic and that's it, because I am way too old to deal with 400 pages of rules anymore."<br/><br/>But then, the Basic Set kinda crept in during the first session, during an unarmed combat.  "Just this one rule lookup," I told myself.  And with the nice searchable PDFs that I have, it is really easy to look up other rules too.  Now, ten sessions in, we run GURPS with the full advanced combat system, pretty much unflensed, and it runs pretty snappily.  (We're in the good part of the GURPS power curve, at about 130 points, so things haven't gotten stupid yet.)</blockquote>\nActually this is the way I feel things should work out, and you'll see I say as sch in the starting post. Start with a basic, easily comprehensible core system, one that everyone can read and comprehend in a few minutes and then embellish it as desired as play progresses. I personally do not enjoy GURPS, but I think its great that SJ Games offers GURPS Lite, and would like to see more games with such an easy, no-cost lead-in                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/3305/i-don-think-im-in-the-same-hobby-anymore" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/3305/i-don-think-im-in-the-same-hobby-anymore" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/3305/i-don-think-im-in-the-same-hobby-anymore/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F3305%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F3305%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
