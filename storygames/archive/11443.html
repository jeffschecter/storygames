From the stuff to watch thread:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>[D&amp;D Box #2]<br/>Wait, so... one box fort levels 1 and 2... and 4E goes to level 30?<br/><br/>I sincerely hope they accelerate that (3-5, 5-10, 11-20, 21-30?).</blockquote>\nThis makes me wonder, is a game that only has two levels still a functional game?  I mean, obviously, if all the basic chargen, reward, and resolution mechanics were included, then it would \u201cfunction\u201d but would it be \u201cfunctional.\u201d<br/><br/>It\u2019s an interesting thought to me.  If I ponied up $20 for the DnD Box set, could I run a successful 10-15 session campaign on two levels.  Could you?<br/><br/>Immediately, my thoughts turn to using magic items to boost character power and player options.  With enough of those, extra levels become almost non-essential.  Items that increased hit points or added shielding would allow for longer, more cinematic combat scenes.  You can make up any old \u201cActivated item deals X damage to a target\u201d things easily enough.  <br/><br/>Such a game could produce many of the old-skool style campaign many of us remember so fondly.  So let me ask, do you think you could run a successful and functional campaign using just the basics and two levels of advancement?  If so, what would it look like?  If not, why not?<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254823">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/LaughingJackWilton" title="LaughingJackWilton"><img alt="LaughingJackWilton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/LaughingJackWilton">LaughingJackWilton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254823/#Comment_254823" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-03T13:47:49+00:00" title="February  3, 2010  1:47PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What immediately made me want to like this boxed set is its style.<br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.wizards.com/global/images/dnd_products_dndacc_244660000_pic3_en.jpg"/><br/>and <br/><img alt="image" src="http://img86.imageshack.us/img86/714/dndredboxfull.jpg"/><br/><br/>Well, you could always create a great campaign over two levels. You could even extend the two levels. Instead of gaining the levels characters could slowly gain abilities of their first level, then their second level. Practically starting from 0 level and moving to 'complete' 2nd level. It would be great to slowly introduce game mechanics and new powers. I would run something like Scourge of the Slave Lords, with what they had in the box of course.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254824/#Comment_254824" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-03T13:48:11+00:00" title="February  3, 2010  1:48PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 3, 2010 1:51PM by David Artman.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A couple of ideas:<br/>(a) A "no--fudge," seriously lethal game could work with the boxed set. How many PCs will make to "max level 2" if the dungeons are super-lethal? Level 3 as "winning."<br/><br/>(b) Obviously, one could restrict XP rewards by a LOT. Basically, make advancement slow down (which, yes, defeats the purpose of the balanced CR system).<br/><br/>(c) Make "level 0" a big deal (this might be an echo of point (a) above)--playing literally from "can't swing a sword without hitting himself" to "competant corporal-type." I dunno if the boxed set would actually support this in any way.<br/><br/>(d) Emsemble play - Super Friends of Lore, basically: Every player makes, actually, about five or six PCs, and then they pull one out of their "stable" based on clues from the DM during setup and the initial delve pitch. Mention of "the undead scourge" means I'm taking my Cleric and Bob takes his Paladin; mention of "a kobold swarm" means I take... uh, whatever class does AoE or crowd control, while Bob takes his "kill 'em by the scores" build Fighter (or whatever).<br/><br/>(e) Team play - Me and My Guys, basically: similar to ensemble play (d) and a variation on (b), you run several PCs at one time, in a given delve; but the XP rewards are shared amongst them all. This allows for higher CR encounters (i.e. big party allows big beasties) without it turning into lock-step, mass level-up. Plus, you get a possibly interesting metagame of deciding how to split up your team's share of the XP--do I level up my Sorceror to level 2, to get the KABOOM; or do I level up four other guys to level 1, to get a broad base of efficacy?<br/><br/>[edit for tipe-o's]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254828/#Comment_254828" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-03T14:11:17+00:00" title="February  3, 2010  2:11PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: LaughingJackWilton</cite>What immediately made me want to like this boxed set is its style.</blockquote>\nRIGHT?

I hear people complaining that they can get "just" 20 sessions of play out of something like this, and what's to say? I consider a product to be a solid purchase if I get one session of play out of it. If I play it twenty times, that's my main game for the year, apparently.<br/><br/>Could be that hardcore D&amp;D players are just used to much, much, much slower games where you're not really playing until the 15th session or something.<br/><br/>It goes without saying that a non-leveling 4th edition D&amp;D seems like a feasible skirmish game to me. I've seen worse, I've played worse, and ripping out the advancement angle could do good things for the game by loosening up the campaign structure. Instead of a campaign you could play individual battles, like a miniatures wargame, for instance. I don't know where the idea that this particular product should be self-contained comes from, though; I haven't seen anything indicating that, and it actually seems obvious that you're supposed to get more if after a couple of sessions it seems like you like the game. From that viewpoint non-advancement seems fine to me.<br/><br/>Were I to specifically look for indefinite campaign play in 4th ed. D&amp;D without advancement, I'd do some minor fine-tuning of the campaign structures and certain rules. The focus of the game would need to shift from character development to in-setting stuff like developing your character's social and financial position in society and having adventures for the sake of whatever it is that the adventures are for in the fiction. That is, you choose to go fight the goblins because that's the only way out of your grinding poverty and into the duke's good graces. Sandbox play would be key. I'd throw out the magic item rules, too, and institute an explicitly non-balanced replacement system that'd drive play - a magic sword that gives you the powers of a third-level fighter would seem pretty scary in a world with only first-level characters, for instance, and a magic pool that allows you to roll some stat improvements could be quite a rush, to the extent that their mechanical impact would actually drive play. Ultimately the mechanical level of character development would mostly consist of minor development in abilities and collecting useful stuff and relationships and rituals, all highly randomized and GM-regulated; essentially the GM would throw stuff out and see what sticks, a lot like old school play. Also allow characters to gain skill points in some interesting way. Sounds doable, a bit of the same relationship that Runequest had with early D&amp;D. Actually sounds a lot like what I'd do if I were to run 4th edition - I get bored and disgusted with character optimization exercises, so you wouldn't get me to run the game anyway without instituting some house rules that prevent the players from preplanning character advancement. Something like this could be it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254952">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeBracy" title="DeBracy"><img alt="DeBracy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nTIWP6SSS5BV3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeBracy">DeBracy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254952/#Comment_254952" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-04T02:07:01+00:00" title="February  4, 2010  2:07AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Quite frankly, $20 is a nice dinner which you ingest in about an hour.

But, I have run many fantasy games with no advancement, or advancement so slow that it is not a factor in play, with great success. I see no reason why D&amp;D specifically would be any different. The challenges faced for any game are the same. Basically what Eero suggests here: \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>Were I to specifically look for indefinite campaign play in 4th ed.
