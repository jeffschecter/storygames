The idea for this thread is that you write down what you are working on and what you've got done this week. At the end of you post you write what you plan to get done in the next week.<br/><br/>People can comment, give support, give advice, etc. The only limit is that no one has to take any advice given. <br/><br/>The purpose of the thread it to give us all a weekly deadline to get something done. I've done this in the past and found it very useful. I'll try posting this thread once a week - so after the week let the old thread die and switch to the new thread. This way it won't get too long. <br/><br/>Anyone can use the thread but I hope that some people will use it regularly so we can form a primary group feel.<br/><br/>Chris Engle/Hamster Press                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242674">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242674/#Comment_242674" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-19T05:33:29+00:00" title="November 19, 2009  5:33AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll start it off.<br/><br/>I continue to work on Engle Matrix Games (over twenty years now). In the last few weeks I finished up doing the layout for the Thunder Hamsters and the Temple of Cheese box. My design work has been fruitful. I've got three designs in the early (fun) stages. I wrote a full draft of a tile placement Matrix Game a month ago. I've been imagining a very limited matrix war game but have little written so far. Yesterday I wrote a third draft of a set of rules to do a "Ten Turn Game" Matrix Game. We are play testing the idea in a PBEM game on my yahoo group "MatrixGame2" The rules are only four pages (which is why I've been able to get to a third draft so quickly (That and it's just a variation on the EMG idea that I've done so many times before).<br/><br/>I've been procrastinating on my web page. I need to finish collecting pictures and do up dates to be ready for post Thanksgiving sales. We make most of our money on stuffied plush animals and puppets rather than games so my energy in not automatically tapped. <br/><br/>My plan for next week is to get the web page updated. I may also work more on the Ten Turn Game rules to refine them more but I'm pleased with them now. I need to give it a day and reread them to see if they make sense then.<br/><br/>Chris Engle/Hamster Press                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_242698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242698/#Comment_242698" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-19T08:36:32+00:00" title="November 19, 2009  8:36AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not 100% sure, but I think this sort of  thing belongs more on Praxis than here: Praxis is for "new game design," S-G is for "actual play, or tweaking existing design as part of actual play." Or so I read when last I was there (yesterday).<br/><br/>Just sayin'....<br/>-----<br/>I'd like to be in, but my problems won't be solved by a "write something this week" incentive or a buddy. UNLESS that buddy is willing to actually hack on the system, make characters trying to break it, or actually organize a few folks in his or her area to do live combat tests.<br/><br/>I need playtesters, and I need them by the score. Without a lot of eyes trying to model a lot of "powers" or "spells" or "skills" (or whole characters from other LARPs or games or fiction) I can't confidently move forward with expanding my System Test Document Gold Master Candidate into a full rule book. <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/><br/><br/>Cool idea in general, though!

Here is what is written in the title of this catagory.<br/><br/>Game Design Help <br/>Category description This is the category for folks to use who are working on a game and need specific, directed help. Ask specific questions, aim for specific feedback. <br/><br/>Game design help seems to be the most specific topic on this forum but the description says "specific directed help" Accountability check in may not meet that criteria. I think saying what you're doing and what you plan to get done is specific but the "help" gotten from others is just their publically seeing what you're planning. That is not a specific piece of feedback. <br/><br/>From what you said, the Praxis site is for working on games ground up. I'm not certain we are talking about that either in this type of thread. Some people may be starting at the beginning but I suspect many aren't. I know I'm not. My games are close to end stage. I would see this more as being about being public with where you are and saying what you will do next so it wouldn't matter where a person was at in development. <br/><br/>We need input from the administrators of the forum on whither this is kosher. This kind of thread is like a self help group. <br/><br/>If it is deamed okay then to Ryan I'd say - Sure! Writing is writing but that's just my opinion and I have absolutely no authority.<br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_242711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242711/#Comment_242711" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-19T09:40:23+00:00" title="November 19, 2009  9:40AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 19, 2009 9:41AM by David Artman.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I suspect that the subforums here at S-G are a bit out of date, or at least their descriptions are.

Do that <b>here</b> [dca - that's Praxis].<br/>Designing a rules hack, optional setting, reskinning for an existing game: That's play-focused talk (and usually "GM Stuff"). <b>Do that on Story-Games</b>.<br/><br/>If you have a discussion that is for the players (GMs, houserulers, hackers), talk about it on Story-Games.<br/>If you have a discussion that is for the designers, talk about it here.<br/><br/>If you have a discussion that truly straddles both sides of the community, create two threads and cross-link.

I'm just pointing out that the whole Praxis site was made for this stuff, so you might not want to get too far into the matchmaking, if you just will have to move it over to there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242714">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242714/#Comment_242714" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-19T09:48:18+00:00" title="November 19, 2009  9:48AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool.

In the latter camp go things like Marketing, Building (websites, presence, materials, connections, expansions, and so on). <br/><br/>The "design from the bottom up" distinction was just in relation to one item that I thought might be difficult to split; <b>House rules for existing games</b> (like, the Red Box Hack 2.0 Classes Thread, where there's a guy posting a bunch of homebrew classes for an existing game, getting feedback etc). While this is an act of creation as powerful as unique game creation, I wanted to keep those threads on S-G, since they relate to the tabletop play of games that are already available. And split the "this is an entirely new game, not a mod or houserule for an existing game" stuff over on Praxis.<br/><br/>But this thread is basically aimed at people who are in the process of writing or have designed or written something, or are (as Chris is) looking to build further upon previous works.<br/><br/>Make sense?<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
