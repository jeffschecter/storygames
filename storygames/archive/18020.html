In brief it was a fun game that lasted around an hour. My bad guy went down to a well deserved death and balance was restored to the world. But before that happened a lot of crazy shit went down.<br/><br/>To set the stage for the game I explained the world to them. "What happens if Snow White goes to Lass Vegas and turns bad? Fairy Tale Assassin League!" (Like the back of the Princess Bride book which goes "What if the most beautiful princess in the world marries the handsomest prince in the world and he turns out to be a son of a bitch? The Princess Bride!")<br/> <br/>The game starts with players picking characters. I picked Rumplestiltskin as my bad guy. The others picked the Huntsman and Hanzel and Gretel. Characters start in one of six locations (Restaurant, parking lot, theater, stage, kitchen and back alley). Rumplestiltskin was in the theater, the Huntsman was in the restaurant, and Hanzel and Gretel were in the back alley.<br/><br/>SETTING THE STAGE<br/><br/>The first act of the game is to come up with reasons why the bad guy has to go down. The bad guy starts by bragging about how bad they are. The heroes then say how they have been personally hurt by the meanie. <br/><br/>Rumplestiltskin: "Everyone knows I've made a fortune with my first grade meth ring. Those six year olds just can't get enough drugs. Of course no one can tie me to the crime..."<br/><br/>Huntsman: "You got my sisters addicted."<br/><br/>Hanzel and Gretel: "You ruined our families meth business. We were impoverished and had to live out in the woods where a witch killed out parents."<br/><br/>You can jump in with suggestions for people's stories that they don't have to accept. I couldn't help but suggest that H+G ended up living in a shoe.<br/><br/>Clearly Rumplestiltskin is a bad man. The rest of the game is about bringing him down (and maybe to justice).<br/><br/>GETTING STARTED <br/><br/>The host/bad guy starts the game. Players take turns making stuff up. Players can point to a scene card (that is about some key point in a revenge story plot) or they may play an action card. Both cards give them victory points. The purpose of the game is to get the most victory points while also telling an interesting story.<br/><br/>I started by pointing to the first scene card "What is the bad guy up to now?" Worth one victory point. And told about how I was planning on expanding my operation into the second grade to capture the lucrative seven year old drug addict market.<br/><br/>The Huntsman challenged my move with the action card "Eureka!" and told how it wasn't second graders that caught my eye but preschoolers. I could tap the totally open market of three and four year olds. We both rolled two six-sided dice and I lost. This meant the Huntsman got my card and his card was discarded. If I had won I would have got both his and my card. Hanzel and Gretel didn't challenge so that ended the turn. Had they challenged the Huntsman they could have won my card.<br/><br/>Mechanically that is how the game is played. The only addition is that if the challenged player wins and they get both cards, they don't lose the bonus card they won in the first challenge if they lost a second challenge. <br/><br/>I don't want to bore you with a play by play, roll by roll account of the game (even if I could remember it accurately). A summary of the action will do.<br/><br/>I brought in Snow White to by mhy bad guy's drug addeled girl friend. Hanzel and Gretel lured my bad guy out into the back alley to confront him but I ambushed them with my henchmen - the seven dwarfs. Other characters were added in and my bad guy was eventually bested in the fight. I ran away leaving my men to take the beating. All along Rumplestiltskin was protected from legal harm by a cart blanche from the governor but as evidence mounted against me I had to try and pin the blame for my crimes on one of the other players. The Huntsman came at me at that point and killed Snow. I successfully challenged him and had Snow die by jumping in the way of the bullet intended for me. Some more ruckus occured and in the end I tried save my bad guy by running away. BANG went the Huntsman's guy and down a fell - bleeding to death in the parking lot of the restaurant. Hanzel and Gretel won the last challenge by playing the "Away into the sun set" action card. They got out of the drug business after getting revenge on me. How sweet...<br/><br/>In the end the Huntsman came out with the most victory points - securing the win. Of course along the way he killed Snow White (the Evil Queen - another one of the villains = will be so pleased). I ended up with the fewest victory points. This is a good thing. The designer really shouldn't win their own game.<br/><br/>The end result of the game was some twisted fun. Evil people did bad things but all with a sense of humor (like the Princess Bride). I think it went very well and I don't think the rules need any more tweaking. It fed my twisted dry sense of humor.<br/><br/>What is next is to finalize how I will package it. Looking at printing costs it seems best to break my 90 card deck into two 54 card products. One will focus on the restaurant, the other will zero in on a casino. Snow White and crew will be in one game and Little Red Riding Hood in the other.<br/><br/>Chris Engle                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
