Think about the subject.<br/>1a. Sometimes, research is what's called for.<br/>1b. Sometimes, it's just time for more brief musings.<br/>2. Adjust the thing you're making.<br/>3. Present it for feedback.<br/>3a. Get feedback from potential audience and stakeholders.<br/>3b. Accept feedback graciously.<br/>3c. Consider the feedback (though not necessarily implementation advice).<br/>3d. Do not immediately discount feedback from outside your experience or expectations.<br/>4. Take your feedback into account, and go to <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>.<br/><br/>Now, I think that the above loop does cover how to think about working with other cultures! (And dealing with problems of cultural misappropriation.)<br/><br/>1. "Man, the culture of Ska in London in 1979 is pretty cool! I'm going to make a game about it."<br/>1a. "Maybe I should read a bit more than this one autobiography. Maybe the history of the UK at the time is important?"<br/>1b. "Maybe I'll just begin by drawing from the important aesthetics."<br/><br/>2. "Okay, so everyone pick this list of economic classes that each have powers! I read something on a wiki and it said that economic class is important."<br/><br/>3. "Man, everyone is going to +1 this like crazy."<br/>3a. "I'm asking some friends who'd play it, some USian who are fans of ska, but also a friend from the UK."<br/>3b. "Thank you for the feedback, friend-from-the-UK! Let me think about your criticisms."<br/>3c. "My US friends were okay with my class implementation, my UK friend pointed out that I'm grossly simplifying things, and suggested some things to read. My UK friend suggests implementing THAC0; I'm not sure if I agree about that solution, in any case."<br/>3d. "I really like my implementation of economic class... And yet, this is worth some consideration."<br/><br/>4. :reads and :thinks and :rewrites<br/><br/>I won't presume that the above takes into account all the issues or is a full answer, but I was thinking about the potential problems of cultural misuse, and I think this design loop should form the basis of my approach.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375618">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375618/#Comment_375618" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T15:18:56+00:00" title="May  1, 2012  3:18PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dev, this is awesome as a template from which to start! Thanks for your thoughts on the subject. I definitely think that presenting a thing to a diverse audience is a step in the right direction towards making sure it isn't inappropriate for some reason that you hadn't considered. I definitely think it's okay to maybe not have considered certain aspects, because it is impossible to have all knowledge about a culture, time, or general headspace not your own. Seeking out collective reasoning (and not listening to it) regarding what may be an oversimplification of something you don't know enough about is exactly the answer I'm looking for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Meserach" title="Meserach"><img alt="Meserach" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Meserach">Meserach</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375679/#Comment_375679" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T18:04:19+00:00" title="May  1, 2012  6:04PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is such a great post.<br/><br/>To address something UserClone said above, and that I have heard elsewhere, I want to reinforce something: it is okay to make mistakes! No-one can ever do ENOUGH research, and you will never reach a level of expertise on topics which allows you to be absolutely sure you are not being in some way disrespectful, hurtful or otherwise appropriating to someone or some group.<br/><br/>It is okay to make mistakes!<br/><br/>What is not okay is to not apologise when confronted with your mistakes; or to defensively point to your research or expertise, to whatever extent it did exist, as exculpatory. If you offended someone, the smart thing to do is to apologise, listen, learn, and do better next time. But you will never be perfect, and there is always more to learn.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375686">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375686/#Comment_375686" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T18:21:50+00:00" title="May  1, 2012  6:21PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dev, this is a great point.

Evan: start a thread discussing your next game, "Hermeneutic Circle", describing the politics of a magical secret society (the Hermeneutic Circle) that uses the Hermeneutic Circle as the process for investigating magic. Thanks!<br/><br/>Part of my message is: if someone says you've done something problematic: don't freak out, and stick to the loop to figure out what to do next. It is different because there are bigger issues at stake when playing with culture you don't own (as opposed to getting feedback on die pool probabilities), but the process is the same.<br/><br/>The above stuff doesn't really go into <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a> (i.e. how to figure out what to do with feedback) or <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231a&amp;Mode=like">#1a</a> vs <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231b&amp;Mode=like">#1b</a>. Those are other hard questions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
