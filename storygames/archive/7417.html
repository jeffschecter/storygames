External -- resolves physical action.<br/>("Do I get what I want?" is implied, but not explicit.)<br/><br/>I want to climb the fence, but someone else wants to stop me.  Who gets what they want?  Internal -- resolves conflicting desires.<br/>("Do I succeed?" is implied, but secondary.)</blockquote>\nTo which Mendel replied:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: wyrmwood</cite>Max, I don't think that works too well. After all, the conflict you mentioned doesn't resolve the conflicting desires, only the outcome of a conflict of desires.</blockquote>\n...which turned on a light bulb for me.  There's a situation I've seen come up before that hinges on exactly that fact.  It goes something like this:<br/><br/>"I stab you."<br/>"No, you don't.  I deflect your strike."<br/>"I try again."<br/><br/>Alternately:<br/><br/>"I pick the lock."<br/>"No, you fail to pick the lock."<br/>"I try again."<br/><br/>This doesn't happen with conflict resolution.  And that pointed out something to me about task resolution: it works OK for situations where the passage of time is sufficient to render repeat attempts impossible.  Here's one:<br/><br/>"The orcs are chasing you toward the door.  You've only got maybe a minute before they catch you."<br/>"I pick the lock."<br/><br/>Here, a failure substantially changes the outcome, because passing time means you can't just keep trying.  That means that your desire is effectively resolved -- you may still want to pick the lock, but you no longer have the opportunity.  That's interesting to me: in order to resolve a desire, task resolution relies on the passage of time to close off options.

As you yourself state, your "desire" was resolved - and that is what conflict resolution is.<br/><br/>It's not at all uncommon to have conflicts resolved by a task resolution system, coincidentally. <i>Solar System</i> from <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i>, for example, does exactly that. Likewise for Sorcerer, Dust Devils 1st edition, Dogs in the Vineyard, Spirit of the Century, Shab-al-Hiri Roach, Mortal Coil and many others. In all cases the key ingredient is a tacit acceptance of letting the whole conflict ride on this one particular task resolution cycle, instead of letting the GM interpret the significance of the task resolution in his own unreliable and subjective manner. That's what makes for a conflict resolution <i>system</i> as opposed to just resolving conflicts informally. (Just to clarify, there are also games that do not do this: 1001 Nights, Polaris, Zombie Cinema, My Life with Master...)<br/><br/>But I guess that's only a cause for one of those endless Internet wrangles about task and conflict resolution. I can't understand how such a simple topic can be so complicated.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_164992">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164992/#Comment_164992" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-25T13:35:27+00:00" title="August 25, 2008  1:35PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Max,<br/>\n  Someone once gave a great example, and I use it all the time:<br/>\nTask Resolution:<br/>\n  Player: "I pick the lock on the Safe"<br/>\n  GM: "OK, you need X, roll it"<br/>\n  Player: "Yay!

Or, to put it another way, until the thing you want is either in your possession or completely out of your grasp, your desire to have it remains unresolved.  That extra thing that puts it out of your grasp is (in some games) necessary to make task resolution function as it was intended -- which highlights one reason why D&amp;D played without keeping track of time just isn't quite right somehow.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: wyrmwood</cite>What is critical is that something change due to the action, even if it's non-mechanical.

Yes, that.<br/><br/>What I was aiming at is that some task resolution designs (though, as you point out, not all of them) ensure that something will change by relying on the passage of fictional time.  As Filip said, D&amp;D is one of these, and it can be a workable approach.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: wyrmwood</cite>For example, in Pure Shoujo failure can be more useful than success.

Which would be outside the fiction.<br/><br/>Interesting that, the difference between preventing ad nauseum repeat attempts using some properties of the imagined stuff, or using some bits outside the imagined stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_164994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164994/#Comment_164994" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-25T13:37:46+00:00" title="August 25, 2008  1:37PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But Dave, what if my skill is "Find Clues"?<br/><br/>(Just messing with you.

It's not quite pointed at the same thing I'm thinking of.  Let me see if I can build on what you've got to show the thing I'm trying to point at:<br/><br/>Conflict resolution:<br/>Player: "I go to the Officer's Club to search for a clue."<br/>GM: "When you get there, Bob tries to stall you before you enter.  Let's see if you can get past him quickly enough to find out what's going on in there."<br/>-- presumably, engage mechanics --<br/><br/>At this point, you either do or do not find a clue.  If you fail, it's over -- you won't get a second chance.  Now let's rewind to see how this might be handled with task resolution:<br/><br/>Player: "I go to the Officer's Club to search for a clue."<br/>GM: "When you get there, Bob tries to stall you before you enter.  What do you do?"<br/>Player: (some actions)<br/>GM's to himself: "If he gets in before 5 minutes have passed, then he catches them red-handed.  If he doesn't, then the room has already been wiped down."<br/>-- engage mechanics --<br/><br/>That's an example of a place where the passage of time is what makes task resolution resolve a conflict.  Without the time element, weird things happen.  The players can keep trying, and the result will be arbitrarily determined by the GM.  Either you don't find anything no matter how quickly you get in, or you always catch them no matter how long it takes, or the GM chooses whatever he feels like.  All of those are by fiat, railroady, illusionist, and generally no fun -- which is often how D&amp;D turns out, when you stop keeping track of time and the other limiting resources that make the system work.<br/><br/>And that's the thing I'm trying to point at: without constraints (e.g. time as a limited resource), task resolution can sometimes default into endless repetition and/or all sorts of other messy stuff.  That's not to say that it's bad, or that conflict resolution doesn't also have problems, but just that task resolution has certain limitations that can be overcome when you buttress it up against certain situational elements.<br/><br/>After Andy's thread about doing away with unified mechanics, I'm really rather curious to see a game that uses <i>both</i> kinds of resolution.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165006/#Comment_165006" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-25T14:17:28+00:00" title="August 25, 2008  2:17PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm going to suggest again that all a resolution system needs is a way of explicitly handling the effects of your actions, such that you know going into it what effects can result (obviating things like that damned safe/clue thing), and exactly what effect <i>did</i> result (which is kinda murky in some "traditional" systems).  <i>Even if you're limited in the kinds of effects you can try for</i>, as long as the Effect mechanics are clear, you're good.<br/><br/>Beyond that, getting the resolution system that is <i>best</i> for a given game is a matter of A) what terms do you want to express effects and effectiveness in, and <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> what structures do you want resolution to impose on play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_165009">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165009/#Comment_165009" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-25T14:32:28+00:00" title="August 25, 2008  2:32PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 25, 2008 2:32PM by Max Higley.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, sort of.

But incentives behind, if you try and fail then that always affects the situation - now this is a task you have tried and failed to perform. Can you try it again? May be, may be not. But there's an odd short-circuit that appears in many games due to whiff factor, where the mechanics do not reflect the fictions definition of your character's competency, re-routing around failure becomes a necessary form of drift. This means we learn as players to treat failures as non-events, not as failed attempts. But that risks us misunderstanding failure when we encounter games where whiff factor has been designed away. To correct for our training we find the need to make failure explicitly meaningful, usually with extra consequences. But that isn't necessary if we remember that a failed attempt is actually something happening all on its own.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
