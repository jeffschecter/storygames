I have had the opportunity to run a few sessions of DW and I am looking for feedback on a different way to look at spells.  As I have used it so far, DW's approach is that casting a spell is a move and the spell description provides the outcome.  I am considering doing each spell as a separate move.  I think this would have a different feel than DW does "out of the box", maybe more sword-and-sorcery and less D&amp;D.  I would appreciate your input on how this might throw off the balance of the game.  For example, would you use a "custom moves" approach to magic to do an Ars Magica hack, or Exalted, or to replicate magic from Abercrombie's First Law Trilogy?  Some quick samples for your review:<br/><br/>Firestorm \u2013 A rain of fire falls from the sky to incinerate your foes.  Roll+Int:<br/>10+: \tChoose 1<br/>7 \u2013 9:\tChoose 2 or the spell fails<br/>6 or less:\tChoose 3 or the spell fails<br/><br/>Your enemies are scorched in the firestorm.  Only heat-warped metal items remain. (I purposely left out hit point damage here in favor of narrative effect).<br/>You fall unconscious from the effort.<br/>You take d8 damage from the strain.<br/><br/><br/>Create Undead \u2013 The hungry dead crawl from the earth at your beckoning.  Roll+Int:<br/>10+: \tChoose 2<br/>7 \u2013 9:\tChoose 1<br/>6 or less:\tThe zombies turn on you with malice in their lifeless eyes<br/><br/>The zombies are under your control.<br/>The number zombies are equal to your level instead of half your level.<br/><br/>Thanks for your input!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397398">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397398/#Comment_397398" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-13T16:44:37+00:00" title="November 13, 2012  4:44PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's certainly a workable option!<br/><br/>For the general direction (spells as moves) you're well served by just making moves that fit well. The Advanced Devling chapter has some on that, and you're already well on your way. The one thing I'd recommend is making even spells have clear triggers. In fact, that could make casting a spell even cooler\u2014if one spell requires invoking the spirits of flame and one requires communing with the dead they can fit in considerably different parts of the game. For example: can you reach the spirits of flame while you're underwater? How, exactly, do you commune with the dead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397409">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397409/#Comment_397409" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-13T18:05:19+00:00" title="November 13, 2012  6:05PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, if the triggers are challenging enough, you can reduce the other limitations - allow the Wizard access to a wider range of spells in exchange for the increased difficulty and higher potential consequences of using them.<br/><br/>I've never been a big fan of the whole "choose which spells to prepare" thing.

I definitely prefer magic as powerful, complicated and a bit ill-defined.  I like cantrips for utility spells but the idea of components, rituals, etc. that you reference is what I have in mind.  I am actually thinking of referencing the Magic Burner for some ideas on "how magic works", or I may just not worry about it and just use my favorite fiction as a reference point for what is possible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397420">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397420/#Comment_397420" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-13T22:00:14+00:00" title="November 13, 2012 10:00PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you seen World of Dungeons?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397421">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397421/#Comment_397421" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-13T22:02:28+00:00" title="November 13, 2012 10:02PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds cool!

For example:<br/>When you break a lightning-struck branch, roll+Wis.  On a 10+, lightning springs forth and travels down your arm, arcing to that at which you point.  On a 7-9, lighting travels throughout your body, arcing to all nearby.<br/>vs<br/>When you send lightning arcing from your outstretched finger, roll+Wis. On a 10+, you make it look so easy, if only they knew how many hours you spent on that hill in the rain.  On a 7-9, your arm is left spasming and temporarily useless as the electric charge dissipates.<br/>Wizards are cool when they can just do magic, despite the cost.  Wizards are also cool when they can get neat effects out of the components and rituals they make use of.  I think a combined approach would be best wherein minor magic is assumed to work automatically (roll for yes vs yes and) whereas mighty magics aren't so certain (roll to find out if or at what cost).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397467">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397467/#Comment_397467" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-14T09:08:00+00:00" title="November 14, 2012  9:08AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 14, 2012 9:08AM by omnifray.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An Elizabethan Plymouth DW hack was recently playtested at Indiecon and took this approach of each spell being a different entirely custom Move.<br/><br/>AP reports on the Indiecon subforum of ukroleplayers.com, including an AP report from me (Indiecon 2012:- The Omnimatt Files, Slot 6).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ticktockman" title="ticktockman"><img alt="ticktockman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ticktockman">ticktockman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397469/#Comment_397469" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-14T09:15:52+00:00" title="November 14, 2012  9:15AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Noofy - Much appreciated!  That would be something to see.  It would be my inaugural effort but I am excited to try.  I just want to make sure it doesn't jam up a well-designed game that I really enjoy.  If this doesn't really add something then it is really just a thought exepriment.<br/><br/>John - Thanks again for the preview.  I will pick this up.  You know, for "research".<br/><br/>Rafu - That could be the way to word each move.  It is elegant, fits the system and gets away from the "spell book" approach.  It prompts another questions for me; whether and how magic scales with levels.  Is there a difference between "when you make the dead rise" at 2nd level, at 5th and at 9th?  The "When you..." could indicate a single outcome (rising dead) along a spectrum of magnitude (a few, some or lots of hungry dead, for example).  My initial thought was that each spell would be a self-contained move.  They could scale, though.  I could use something like the Light-Moderate-Serious-Critical scale of individual spell effects broken out and assigned by level like in D&amp;D though it close to what DW already has.  It could be a more flexible spectrum more like what I see in Ars Magica (formalized) or KPFS (informal, but still a favorite of mine).  Good food for thought.<br/><br/>Deliverator - Excellent point.  I was focused on spells and neglected the other moves.  This magic style could potentially fit under the ritual rules, and thus be a "module" of sorts that Dungeon World GMs and Players can use or leave on the shelf.  In my view, rituals should have grander and more costly effects.  If you want a hurricane and not a storm, if you want a legion of dead, not a handful - then you need a ritual or "move magic".  One of the key differences between spells-as-separate-moves from spell-as-one-move is that moves allow you to assign individual consequences and scales of success and failure.  In the DW spell system as written the failure consequences for spells is the same, though the GM "putting you in a spot" is pretty broad and could cover most outcomes.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397470">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397470/#Comment_397470" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-14T09:23:22+00:00" title="November 14, 2012  9:23AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 14, 2012 9:25AM by mease19.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Spells as moves might also work well in games where you intentionally omit  spellcasters, for example a game with only a fighter/ranger/thief, and spells are moves that anyone can take or make.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397473">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jacob" title="Jacob"><img alt="Jacob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jacob">Jacob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397473/#Comment_397473" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-14T09:37:28+00:00" title="November 14, 2012  9:37AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            mease19; Totally!

Let me dig up the link.<br/><br/>Here we go: <a href="http://www.goodman-games.com/5070preview.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.goodman-games.com/5070preview.html</a><br/><br/>I know <a href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">@skinnyghost</a> has played it a bunch.</blockquote>\nI have indeed played the living shit out of DCC (probably 30 sessions total so far).  The spells are amazing and ridiculous - nearly half the book is taken up with spells because each spell has its own critical hit and fumble results.  Magic missile, for example, scales up from 1 missile doing 1 damage on a roll of 12 all the way up to a meteor swarm of missiles, independently targeted, each doing like, 2d10 damage or something insane on a roll of 30+ <br/><br/>You could very easily make up a miss / 7-9 / 10+ results table for each and every spell in the game.  It'd be really easy.  The trigger for each move could be as simple as "when you cast magic missile, roll + INT" <br/><br/>You could have results hard-coded or allow the wizard to choose from a series of results on a general spell table + some unique per-spell results.  It'd require that the Wizard be quick-thinking, though, or you end up watching the Wizard take ten times longer to cast spells than any other player taking an action.<br/><br/>DCC-ifying Dungeon World would actually be pretty simple in general.  Just add a "roll 12" to a bunch of moves to represent critical hits, make up tables for them and then add a "2 or less" option to moves, too, for fumbles.   Snake eyes and boxcars, right?  <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397477">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ticktockman" title="ticktockman"><img alt="ticktockman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ticktockman">ticktockman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397477/#Comment_397477" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-14T09:52:16+00:00" title="November 14, 2012  9:52AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good stuff!  I just bought from DTRPG.  Looking forward to reading it.  At first glance, it is interesting that the scale of the spell is really tied to the success of the roll, so a low-level wizard could still cast spells with incredible narrative impact.<br/><br/>How would you determine how many spells a wizard could cast/know?

Even if the item is reusable, that's still a huge limiter, given how the weight rules work (especially for a Wizard).<br/><br/>Others could require actions that take some time are would be difficult to do quickly during a combat but much easier when in a secure location or when you're well prepared ahead of time. The Alarm spell already does this, but of course that's a spell that would usually be used while camping rather than in the middle of a fight.<br/><br/>For example, Polymorph could require you to have a clay figure of what you want the creature to morph into. You could carry around a clay sheep by default, but if you want to resculpt the clay, that takes a camp action. And if you carry around more than one lump of clay, that starts taking up Weight. Those sorts of fictional limitations remove the need to limit the number of spells available more than the "three plus one per level" limit already present.<br/><br/>Also, if you increase the consequences of failure (which your examples do), then you might not need to limit which spells are available as much.<br/><br/>Another possibility would be to add a Cast It From The Book move that lets you cast any spell you have learned but do not have memorized, with the fictional cost that it takes a few minutes to do (and therefore cannot be done during combat without some fictional positioning, such as having someone defend you while you prepare it).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397494/#Comment_397494" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-14T11:58:40+00:00" title="November 14, 2012 11:58AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            About limits: once spells are individual non-basic Moves, the most reasonable "limit" to spells is the overall number of non-basic Moves you're allowed to write into your character booklet.
