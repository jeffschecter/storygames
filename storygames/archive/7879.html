My game <b>Ganakagok</b> makes heavy use of a specially devised tarot, and the feel that this creates for the game is one that highlights the fantastical and the fabulous. It feels like a myth or fable, in other words.<br/><br/>So when I got a hold of the <i>Deck of Many Things</i> published as a game accessory by Paizo, my thoughts naturally turned to how to work it in to a D&amp;D 4th edition game. Recall that the Deck is a powerful item of miscellaneous magic or minor artifact from previous editions of D&amp;D in which a score or so of tarot-like \u201ctrumps\u201d are associated with various beneficial or crocked in-game events\u2014gain a purse of treasure, lose your soul in the Abyss, and so forth. The insight that hit as I spread the deck out in front of me was that the motifs on the cards mapped pretty well onto the canonical fourth edition deities, so that I could assign each deity to a card (granted, with a few cards left over, but that just meant there was room for me to create some new gods). Given that each deity is associated with key words relating to his or her domain, assigning gods to cards creates a nifty little system of signification.<br/><br/>Balance \u2013 Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon \u2013 justice, nobility, honor, protection.<br/>Comet \u2013 Avandra, Goddess of Change \u2013 luck, travel, trade, merchants, adventure.<br/>Donjon \u2013 Torog, the King that Crawls \u2013 the underworld, imprisonment.<br/>Euryale \u2013 Zehir, the Serpent-King \u2013 darkness, poison, assassins, serpents.<br/>Fates \u2013 Zerasho, Goddess of Fate [non-canon] \u2013 destiny, fulfillment, life course.<br/>Flames \u2013 Bane, God of War \u2013 war, conquest, conflict.<br/>Fool \u2013 Melora, the Wild Queen \u2013 the wilderness, the sea.<br/>Gem \u2013 Tiamat, Goddess of Hoards \u2013 wealth, greed, vengeance.<br/>Idiot \u2013 Tharizdun, the Mad God \u2013 annihilation, madness.<br/>Jester \u2013 Corellon, the Fey King \u2013 arcane magic, beauty, arts, spring.<br/>Key \u2013 Moradin, God of the Smithy \u2013 creation, artisans, family.<br/>Knight \u2013 Kord, Lord of Battles \u2013 storms, strength, battle.<br/>Moon \u2013 Sehanine, Lady of the Moon \u2013 trickery, love, autumn.<br/>Rogue \u2013 Lolth, Queen of Lies \u2013 spiders, shadows, lies.<br/>Ruin \u2013 Gruumsh, the Destroyer \u2013 turmoil, destruction.<br/>Skull \u2013 Vecna, the Necromancer \u2013 secrets, undeath.<br/>Star \u2013 Ioun, Goddess of Wizards \u2013 knowledge, prophecy, skill.<br/>Sun \u2013 Pelor, the Sun Lord \u2013 agriculture, time, summer.<br/>Talons \u2013 The Raven Queen \u2013 death, doom, winter.<br/>Throne \u2013 Asmodeus, Lord of the Nine Hells \u2013 power, domination.<br/>Vizier \u2013 Erathis, the Muse \u2013 civilization, invention, laws.<br/>Void \u2013 Pazuzeus, the Soul Eater [non-canon] \u2013 chaos, entropy, emptiness.<br/><br/>(Notice that you can get some interesting connotations by changing up my assignments. You may prefer, for example, to give Avandra the goddess of merchants the card "Balance" and Bahamut the god of good dragons the card "Comet," or switch the Raven Queen from Talons to Throne and give Asmodeus the Talons. The metaphorical and metaphysical implications are nifty).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174691/#Comment_174691" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-12T18:10:04+00:00" title="October 12, 2008  6:10PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the mini-campaign I\u2019ve been running, I\u2019ve been experimenting with techniques that make use of the Deck. I\u2019ve alluded to them in another thread, but they received little traction there. So I thought it was worth it to throw them out to continue the conversation about story-gaming the hell out of D&amp;D.<br/><br/><b>Starting the Campaign.</b> Begin by laying out the \u201ccore assumptions\u201d of D&amp;D\u2014that is, many races that mainly get along, a fallen empire, surviving \u201cpoints of light\u201d in a sea of darkness, and so forth\u2014to the players so that everyone is on the same page. If you want to change these assumptions, now is the time to discuss that. <br/><br/>Take the Deck of Many Things and a blank piece of paper\u2014preferably a big sheet, like posterboard. This is the World Map. Deal out three cards to each player (including yourself if you have enough cards). Tell each player: Take two of the cards and combine them in order to create a location on the map. The location can be a city, a landmark, a homeland, or a wilderness, e.g. <br/><br/>For example: Imagine a player decides to use Flames (war) and Idiot (annihilation and madness) in combination. He imagines a region that was once the seat of the Empire brought low in an orgy of violent destruction as rival factions descended into paroxysms of slaughter and devastation. Now all that is left is the remnants of those factions, huddled miserably in an impoverished land called the Cassecouer (the Broken Heart). The player outlines the boundaries of the Cassecouer on the map, sketching a ruined castle on a hill. <br/><br/>Tell each player: Now take the third card and, create an event that took place in a location you didn\u2019t create; this can be a war, a reign or an abdication, a disaster, a romance, a migration, a birth, a death, a life, or anything else your imagination can come up with. Note the event on the map.<br/><br/>For example: Imagine a different player decides to use her card to create an event for the Cassecouer. She has Skull (secrets, undeath) in her hand and lays it down. She describes an event she calls \u201cthe Ravening,\u201d when covens of necromancers unleashed their secretly amassed zombie legions upon the land. She draws a stick-figure zombie shambling within the borders of the Cassecouer, and writes, \u201cBeware! The legions of the Ravening are yet girt for battle.\u201d<br/><br/>Collect the cards and shuffle the deck. Deal out two cards to each player. The first card is their character\u2019s patron; the second is their character\u2019s nemesis. The player can read the cards however they like to create their character\u2019s background or motivation or both.<br/><br/>For example, imagine that a player draws Knight (storms, strength, battle) as his patron and Euryale (darkness, poison, assassins, serpents) as his nemesis. The player could say that his character is a dwarven cleric, fighter, or warlord sworn to Kord and engaged in a long struggle in the darkness against foes aligned with Zehir. Alternately, the character is a fighter with a high strength who has to struggle not to use his strength to evil ends: the darkness he fights is within himself. Yet again, the character may be a rogue who thrives on chaos (storms) but is either haunted by deaths she has caused or pursued by a hateful assassin in the employ of enemies she has made.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174692">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174692/#Comment_174692" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-12T18:10:43+00:00" title="October 12, 2008  6:10PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Playing the Game.</b> Start the first session by coming up with a starting situation that incorporates the backgrounds and motivations created by the players. If necessary, throw a card to prompt your creativity. Let the fiction drive the starting situation for subsequent gaming sessions.<br/><br/>Sessions are divided into encounters and interstitials. Encounters are either battle scenes or skill challenges. Interstitials are how you get from encounter to encounter, and include role-playing as well as meta-game elements.<br/><br/><b>Quests.</b> During an interstitial, quests can be created. A player takes an index card and writes a phrase like \u201cUncover the source that sustains the Ravening\u201d on it. The format can be generalized as [Action] {Object}; e.g., [Uncover] {the source that sustains the Ravening}. <br/><br/>Quests are designated either as major or minor. It takes the consensus of all the players to create a major quest. There can be no more than two major quests in play at any given time. There can be as many minor quests in play as there are players at the table.<br/><br/>A major quest must take as its object something indicated on the world map; a minor quest can have anything as its object. <br/><br/>Major Quest: [Free] {the Cassecouer} [from oppression].<br/>Minor Quest: [Convince] {my family} [that I\u2019m worthy of their respect].<br/><br/>The player creating the quest gives it a level (which in this case amounts to how much effort it takes to complete the quest). Quests are completed by finishing encounters; each level of encounter can be allocated to one quest after it\u2019s successfully finished. So, for example, a fourth-level encounter that has been completed successfully allows four levels to be distributed among the various quests that the party is pursuing. This allocation is done by consensus of the party, and should be accompanied by some rationalization, justification, or other reference to the events of the encounter.<br/><br/>A major quest requires its level times three worth of encounter levels to complete. A minor quest requires its level in encounter levels to complete. So a third level major quest can be completed with a level five and two level two encounters (which equal nine encounter levels) while a fourth level minor quest could be completed with a single fourth level encounter. Each character would be awarded 150 xp for completing a major third-level quest; if there were five players, each would receive 35 xp for completing a minor fourth-level quest.<br/><br/>When a minor quest is completed, players split xp equal to the value of a single standard monster of that level. When a major quest is completed, each player gains xp equal to the value of a single standard monster of that level.<br/><br/>Additionally, the quest may be resolved narratively by drawing a card from the Deck of Many Things and reading it as the (successful) conclusion of the quest. If at any time the party decides to abandon a quest, draw a card and read it as the result of their failure to act.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174693">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174693/#Comment_174693" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-12T18:10:59+00:00" title="October 12, 2008  6:10PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>The Encounter Deck.</b>  This consists of 10 cards. If the party is first level, the deck contains four Level 1 cards, three Level 2 cards, two Level 3 cards, and one Level 4 card. At the beginning of the interstitial, draw a card to determine the strength of the next encounter; at the end of the encounter, increase the level of the card by one and put it in a discard pile. At the end of the session, or after drawing the last card, shuffle the discards back into the encounter deck.<br/><br/><b>Battle Scenes.</b> As per the DMG: multiply the number of players by the standard xp per monster for the encounter level to determine the DM\u2019s budget for including adversaries, hazards, and obstacles. Play out the encounter; award xp for winning, half xp for losing.<br/><br/><b>Skill Challenges.</b> The players must succeed at N skill rolls before failing three times; the skill rolls are DC 10 at 1st level and increase by 2.5 points per level (rounded down), so DC 12 at 2nd level, DC 15 at 3rd level, DC 17 at 4th, DC 20 at 5th, and so forth. You can opt to set up the skill challenge so that it\u2019s more rolls at lower DCs or fewer rolls at higher DCs. The challenge is worth xp equal to the sum of the DCs times 10; a failed challenge is worth half the xp.<br/><br/>Players get to describe what they\u2019re doing to face the challenge or help another player instead. Players who make a daring effort (+5 DC) are awarded an action point if they succeed. Players can attempt a skillful recovery at +5 DC by spending an action point; success negates a failure.<br/><br/><b>Treasure Tokens.</b>Both battle scenes and skill challenges generate \u201ctreasure tokens \u201d equal to the level of the encounter. During an interstitial, the party can decide to spend treasure tokens to roll on a treasure table in the DMG. Spend tokens equal to the party\u2019s level plus one for one roll on the table equal to the party\u2019s level.<br/><br/><b>Blood Tokens.</b> Whenever a player blows a d20 roll, he or she takes a \u201cblood token.\u201d These can be used later for +2 to a d20 roll (e.g., skill roll, attack, or save) or +1 to damage. The token can be spent after the d20 roll but must be spent before a damage roll. Blood tokens go away after any brief rest.<br/><br/><b>Interstitials.</b> Interstitials are used for meta-gaming: creating quests, buying equipment, conducting rituals, acquiring treasure and magic items, and resting either briefly or for an extended time. Remember that rests are a game-mechanical rather than a purely narrative or in-game device; it\u2019s possible for days and days to pass, but if the players desire, they can assert that no rest has taken place.<br/><br/>Interstitials are also used for setting up the next encounter. Draw a card from the Deck of Many Things and read it when the characters embark upon a course of action and you\u2019re not sure of the consequences, when they\u2019re looking for information and you\u2019re not sure of the answers, or when they\u2019re wondering what happens next. Read the card with an eye towards creating the next challenge for the characters.<br/><br/>Travel is particularly appropriate as an interstitial event. Give each player a card and let them narrate it as a person, place, object, or event that they experience in their travels. Allow them to add to the world map as they move forward. Similarly, while they are \u201cin town,\u201d do the same thing, but allow them to read the card as their experiences in the town, possibly creating a separate city map upon which to record the people, places, and things they meet.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>The heart of this idea is formalizing the \u201cquest\u201d (as discussed in the DMG), which links encounters to the game-world via the medium of the characters. It makes each encounter meaningful in the larger scheme of things, and gives players a lot of power to help author the game-world. It turns D&amp;D into rather more of a pick-up game while at the same time attempting to preserve the coherence of the fantasy campaign.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174696">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue" title="Rob Donoghue"><img alt="Rob Donoghue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.logrus.com/~moose/tinyhat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue">Rob Donoghue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174696/#Comment_174696" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-12T19:41:50+00:00" title="October 12, 2008  7:41PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dude, This looks awesome, but I need to not find threads like this when I'm about to pass out for the night!<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce" title="Dave Younce"><img alt="Dave Younce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g232/thomastamblyn/Avatars/GoPlayDice.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce">Dave Younce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174700/#Comment_174700" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-12T23:56:20+00:00" title="October 12, 2008 11:56PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very Cool, Bill!

The thing I should point out is that it has the same assumption built into it as 4e itself does: PC consensus is unremarkable. That is, the players at the table always agree as to the next course of action, and always stick together ("Don't split the party!"). In a situation where there is a strong DM to balance things out, this assumption is not far wrong. Under the sort of conditions that prevail in Ganakagok-ified D&amp;D, though, the assumption may break down. And since there are no rules for mediating character conflict (other than going to the mattresses), you'll need to figure out how you want to handle that when you're running a game. You can keep it at the level of the table: let players vote, or rely on "primate dominance dynamics," or some other metagame mechanic like that. Or you can push it down to the level of the fiction: roll off Diplomacy vs. Will until one character fails, and they're the one who gives in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_175065">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Apeiron" title="Apeiron"><img alt="Apeiron" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Apeiron">Apeiron</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175065/#Comment_175065" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-15T08:00:00+00:00" title="October 15, 2008  8:00AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Pop this into a PDF and publish it!

That's not a huge problem, just something to be worked around. Also, the player-empowering philosophy that underlies this approach runs a little counter to the "Old School" underpinnings of 0e. Recognizing that is important. One of the hardest things for me was to give up supreme authoring rights, but I don't think you can hedge your bets by building in a DM veto over the fiction (rather than, say, over the implementation of the game-mechanics in tactical play). In a way, these rules are an admission that I should have backed away further in that regard than in fact I did in play.

You're a roleplaying <i>maverick</i>.<br/><br/>Considering the responsibilities of narration squarely placed upon the shoulders of players in 0e, and the Quick Primer, this would essentially place the entirety of the narrative burden on the players. They would be responsible for setting, conflict, and also narrating how their kewl powers save the day. My worry would be that with all that control over the narrative space, one might run into Czege Principle issues, which the Deck randomizers may or may not be enough to eliminate. The loose interpretation of the cards assures creativity on the players' part, but allow allows for a great deal of interpretation; perhaps that much additional interpretation of action in play would be too hippie-tastic for average play. The consensus in groups I've recently played with: Give us widgets or give us setting. Don't give us both, and don't give us neither.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175732">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175732/#Comment_175732" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-21T19:34:23+00:00" title="October 21, 2008  7:34PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>This is golden stuff. I think that this has certainly revitalized my interest in 4e. It kind of makes me think of Legend of Mana. Legend of Mana was part of the Mana console rpg series, but it was the unusual one of the bunch. The game had a metagame of placing down "Artifacts" on the world map to bring new locations that the characters can visit into being. It was deeply flawed and really a collection of sidequests, but the human element of having a GM and player interpretation of cards would easily avoid the problems that affected the game.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_175888">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175888/#Comment_175888" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-23T03:47:00+00:00" title="October 23, 2008  3:47AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jarrod, I agree. There has to be a space for the DM to oppose the players. The more I think about it in the context of 4e, the more I think that space lies in the encounter and specifically in creating fun adversaries to fight; everything else is negotiable, since the point is to create buy-in for the encounter (on the one hand) and to use the encounter as the "hard" place that validates all the hand-wavy fuzziness of the interstices (on the other). So I'd accept "give us widgets or give us setting" as the rule, too, but I'd argue that you could have both so long as only one was in force at any given moment of play (so interstice = widgety, encounter = settingified). To be sure, I've been doing that wrong, but my mind is right now.<br/><br/>Tulpa, I like the comparison. The thing that has worked from my perspective is formal player-created quests. At first I tried to do it so that players had to push during the encounter to reveal information that would then guide their further action, but this proved too unwieldy (since players preferred to fight first and ask questions later). So the quest system really abstracts the information-gathering portion of the game while keeping it in its traditional place (between encounters). To a certain degree, it addresses the information-bottleneck issue by that act of abstraction: there's no chance that a party will get "stuck" because completing an encounter automatically advances the success of a major or minor (but never side) quest.<br/><br/>Elliott: It is your own damn fault for moving away!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175890/#Comment_175890" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-23T03:55:00+00:00" title="October 23, 2008  3:55AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thinking on this, it fulfills the request model which D&amp;D has informally had in my presence for time immemoriam.<br/><br/>Example 1: "Bill, I don't care what happens in this game, but if I don't kill a Displacer Beast tonight you're walking home from game."<br/><br/>Example 2: "Bill, the last two games I've bought a medallion to control a Sphere of Annihilation.
