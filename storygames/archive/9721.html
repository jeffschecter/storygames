Given that Ryan worked with Paul on the game by developing and editing it, it's not a standard interview -- they talk about it as insiders sharing a bit about creating the project with fans, especially over some of the pitfalls and issues they ran into together. After the interview, a few people wish Ryan well on achieving his fiftieth episode, and he shares his thoughts on the future of the show.<br/><br/>Running time: 32:04 / File size: 22.0M<br/><br/><a href="http://masterplanpodcast.net/index.php?post_id=498075" rel="nofollow">http://masterplanpodcast.net/index.php?post_id=498075</a><br/><br/>- Ryan                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
