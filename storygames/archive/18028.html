Agree on where you want to set the story and talk about the genre and tone you want to explore.<br/>2.\tBookend history as normal, but then add a Middle Period: these three periods are the only ones you may explore during play. Each period should be named after the family living in the house at that time: take time to define the family and the roles of its members.<br/>3.\tPay a lot of attention to the Palette: make sure it reflects the genre and tone talked about when creating the Big Picture. The story is going to be very tightly focused in this hack, so don\u2019t be tempted to make the Palette speculative, just to see what other people do with it; say yes to things that <i>have</i> to be included, not just things that can be. Say no to anything that breaks the genre or tone, but not things that create obstacles to other players\u2019 creativity.<br/>4.\tDuring the First Pass, each period must receive at least one event; remember that you can\u2019t create new periods in this variant and that you can\u2019t create scenes during the First Pass.<br/><br/>With the foundations for the story laid, you can now play the game, with the following changes:<br/>1.\tWhen picking the focus, choose a family-related theme (illness, work stress, marital strife, etc) or a plot thread that directly affects the house and its surroundings across all three periods (a fire, a new motorway being built, urbanisation, etc.)<br/>2.\tUnlike regular <b>Microscope</b>, in this variant you can only go forward within each period: if you ever want to explore something that happened before an established event or scene, you have to do that in an earlier period, not in the same one. You can never create a new event or scene that precedes anything else which has been established in that period.<br/>3.\tCreating scenes should take precedence over creating events: don\u2019t tell the other players what happens, show them and allow them to take part in it. Only create a new event when a prior one has been exhausted: remember, you can\u2019t go back, so only the most current event in any period can ever have scenes added to it and each new scene takes place after any prior ones.<br/><br/>Continue play as normal, but keep your eye on how long the game is taking so you can try to identify which round will be the last one; in the final round, everyone should strive to wrap up loose ends and provide a sense of closure for the story told in each period.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
