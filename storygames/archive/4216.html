This is inspired from Sight C, Sound B and Concept A.<br/><br/>You play escaped prisoners in a "medieval German forest"-esque setting.  The game is sort-of GM-less, in that none of the players is the GM.  The GM is instead a playlist set on random.  The game puts you in a life-or-death morality situation where you have to choose between helping someone else or not -- but if you don't you're more likely to remain unscathed.  The experiment is trying to work in Prisoner's Dilemma at the mechanic, but instead of with two people, it's you &amp; the playlist/GM -- with various rewards/penalties.<br/><br/>Creating characters:<br/>* What is your name?<br/>* All the characters are guilty of a crime -- a crime that did in fact commit.  What crime did you commit?<br/>* How did you get caught?<br/>* You owe a favor or are in debt to the guy on your right.  Why?  You &amp; the guy on your right should hash this out together.  Remember: the guy on your left owe you as well.<br/><br/>As a group, you also create your Friend.  He's an NPC who was imprisoned like yourself, and orchestrated the breakout.  The beginning of the game involves playing an intro audio file that sets the stage for the game:  the Friend is bit by something, seems to be dying, tells you to the run for church, then starts growling -- a human growl, nothing more.  Your Friend becomes the monster that will hunt you down, but the game will always refer to him as Your Friend and never describes his appearance.<br/><br/>The game is played on a map -- the physical layout of which I haven't completely defined.  On one end is where you start, on the other is  where the Church is -- the safe haven you're trying to flee towards.  Whatever evil is in this forest may not pass the Church's threshold.<br/><br/>The Crunchiness Handles:<br/>* Guilt Tokens -- you start with one Guilt Token.  Depending on the choices you make, you'll gain more Guilt Tokens.  (Earlier I was considering that any damage you take by Your Friend is expressed as Guilt Tokens, as only the Guilty are harmed.  But I decided against this while writing this post.)<br/><br/>* Penance Tokens -- you start with zero Penance Tokens, and may gain them depending on the choices you make -- even if it gets you wounded, you can earn Penance Tokens for helping a friend.  (Which is why I don't want Wounds to equal Guilt, because then it'll be a bit zero-sum if I'm looking to compare Guilt &amp; Penance tokens.)<br/><br/>* Wound Tokens -- you start with zero, and you die when you get some number, like five or ten.  (And perhaps if you die, the Strength of the attacks increases -- you get one Wound to start because there's only one monster, but when you die there's another monster.  But, that might be pushing too much on helping someone for your own benefit.)<br/><br/>* Map Location -- Where you are on the map is something that the game can play with.  You can only move if your choice lets you.<br/><br/>Endgame:<br/>There are two triggers for Endgame:<br/>* When there are fewer than two prisoners on the board (i.e. alive and not in the church).<br/>* When an audio track starts with church bells, and there's at least one person in the church.<br/><br/>With the latter, you load up another randomized playlist that has three endings, and you play one:<br/>(1) [Safe Haven ending] Those in the Church win.<br/>(2) [Forgiveness of God ending] Those with more Penance than Guilt win (dead or alive).<br/>(3) [I don't have a title for this one] Those in the Church with more Penance than Guilt win.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94463">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94463/#Comment_94463" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-10T15:08:43+00:00" title="September 10, 2007  3:08PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 10, 2007 11:08PM by Ryan_Macklin.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Design goals:<br/><br/>* Playable in 60-90 minutes<br/>* Easy to play -- the game walks you through playing with minimal (but probably some) pre-understanding.<br/>* Facilitates highly immersive gameplay -- I want to make an immersive board game, and it seems a good way to achieve that is to also make it a role-playing game and to engage the players' senses via the audio files.<br/>* Doesn't require "esoteric" RPG knowledge or special gaming stuff (more people have Winamp, Windows Media Player or iTunes than they do d4s &amp; d12s).<br/><br/>Edit: New goal: the non-audio elements should ideally fit inside a CD case when folded.<br/><br/>Inspirations:<br/>* Sight C, the man in the shadows -- there's no definition, and there's something foreboding about him.

They aren't great, but it's good enough to work for playtesting.  If you're interested, you can grab them at:<br/><a href="http://www.tomorrowtheworldgames.com/lab/OnlyTheGuiltyRun_Audio_v1.zip" rel="nofollow">http://www.tomorrowtheworldgames.com/lab/OnlyTheGuiltyRun_Audio_v1.zip</a> (1.61M)<br/><br/>Surprisingly, I was able to fit all the files in less than 2M thanks to encoding everything at 32kbps.<br/><br/>I have one Intro track, twelve Game tracks and three Ending tracks.  Each track type has the same length &amp; same ID3 tags (aside from track number), so that you can't (or shouldn't be able to) guess which track you're on or about to be on if you're watching the screen.  The trick will be seeing how well this works on shuffle* on various playing programs.  In programs that don't pause between tracks, it should (ideally) sound like someone is constantly running in the game.  That's incorporating Sound B, man!<br/><br/>Each Game track is 22 seconds, and they flow from one to the other (without a tone or anything to break them up, we'll see if that's needed but I didn't want to break the atmosphere).  So, if my simulations show a game being over in around 45-50 turns for 4 people, then the game will take between 18 &amp; 20 minutes to play (adding in a one minute intro &amp; 30 second ending, not adding any further set-up time, which is fairly minimal).  So, I guess that's a game in 30 minutes.  I'm not sure if that's not satisfying, but if not I could experiment with increasing the play with how many wounds you can take before you die and how many spaces it is from the start to the Church (which, right now, is 10 &amp; 11 respectively -- and you start with 2 wound tokens.)<br/><br/>Next up is the map portion of the game.  The map and main play rules should fit on 4.75" by 19" -- one side of a four-fold CD insert (4.75" by 4.75").  For the contest, I'll split this up into two halves.
