One can scam people, one can rob the life savings of a poor villager, one can become a merchant and make money in investments... all of that is possible within play and fine. But none of it will earn experience. <br/><br/>Other games work differently, of course.<br/><br/>But I'm talking below about the premise of XP set up in LotFP, why I like it, and why I think it works. The game is premised on Adventures going into Adventurous environments to have Adventures. Everything is built from this, as far as I can tell.<br/><br/>This is also why LotFP gives a bit of experience for killing things, but not proportionally as much as getting treasure:<br/><br/>First, the XP for killing only counts if the creature killed really is a threat or danger and worthy of an Adventurers deeds.<br/><br/>Second, it means that the PCs still get the real juicy XP even if they come up with methods of getting around the creatures at hand in clever ways. The game isn't about slaughtering. It's about getting to treasure and removing by whatever method the Players choose to have the PCs use. There is a flexibility in this, opening up all possibilities of behavior, tactics, and strategy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424293/#Comment_424293" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-16T15:48:24+00:00" title="November 16, 2013  3:48PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 16, 2013 3:49PM by lumpley.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My personal fave is when you get XP for spending your treasure, not for accumulating it.<br/><br/>In Lamentations of the Flame Princess, it explicitly specifies that you get XP for recovering treasure that's been lost, NOT from scamming or robbing villagers.

It's a motive with a universal adaptor on it.</i><br/>-- Joe Sarno, THE WAY OF THE GUN<br/></b><br/>First, here's my take on what I think an OSR game would mean for <i>me</i>.<br/><br/>The following qualifiers are part of what I see in OSR play:<br/>* The PCs begin vague, without thick backstories or connections to the world<br/>* The world is more solid than the PCs. The PCs go push and pull and knock into the world to explore the environment created by the GM<br/>* The possibility of PC death is a given (no "script immunity."<br/>* There is no epic tale being told about these particular PCs, no long arc about <i>them</i>. The tales that are formed are formed by what happens -- even if the end of the tale is, "And then he died."<br/>* The PCs go into dangerous places and strange and dangerous encounters within those places.<br/>* The fictional world exists beyond the dangerous places -- a backdrop for contrast to the dangerous places. But the PCs are adventurers -- so the focus of play is going on adventures.<br/>* The Players show up to play Adventurers who go on Adventures.<br/>* The nature of the fiction is this: A group of Adventurous personalities interact with a series of situations to obtain treasure.<br/>* The GM creates the adventuring environments and the non-adventuring environments and controls them. The Players control the PCs. The GM can have NO expectations of what the Players are supposed to do or how the "adventure" will turn out. Or, more precisely, the adventure is forged by the choices the Players make for their Characters as they interact with the fictional environment, no more, no less.<br/><br/>Note that, when we start play, there is no way the character in this sort of play cares about some princess who needs rescuing or some warlord who is conquering the land who needs to be stopped. They are some dude with a sort and some dude with some magic and some dude who can pick a lock if he's lucky that day. And they show up from someplace <i>other</i> and they're here (the fictional, specific place of the start of play) because, well, the GM has something cool he cooked up he wants to share with them: An adventurous environment worthy of adventures.<br/><br/>Now, there are plenty of people who are much smarter about this stuff than I am. These people are called game designers. I am not one of them. What I think I <i>might</i> be good at is looking at the tools other people already made up and thinking, "Okay, what's the most efficient way to get the effect we're looking for?"<br/><br/>So, when I look at that list above, what occurs to me is that I <i>could</i> try to hook them into a tale with a Princess who needs rescuing. Or tell them of a warlord with lots of treasure that needs to be stopped. But if they don't care about some princess they've never met or some warlord who has never done them any harm, maybe they'll just yawn. And then when I say, "But guys, there's no adventure if you don't go!" then they'll go, but they're kind of annoyed because they're doing this despite the fact they don't care.<br/><br/>This is why, for example and for contrast, in a game like <i>Sorcerer</i>, the GM doesn't try to rope Players into his stories. The Players make up their characters and situations they care about, and then hand them to the GM to go off and build the larger world and situations from. The Players are invested because they are all already invested.<br/><br/>But dig this:<br/><br/>If the XP system is built on finding treasure in adventurous locations, and the Players know that every adventure hook I drop before them involves treasure, the fictional elements of the adventure don't matter <i>as a lure</i>. Stolen Princess or Horrible Warlord, it doesn't make a difference. What does make a difference is there is loot to be had, and loot means XP.<br/><br/>Now, they'll engage the fictional stuff when they get to, and it will engage them when they get to it. But they'll be engaging with it because there is always the lure of the treasure beyond the interactions. No matter if they're interacting with the fiction to rescue the Princess or to defeat the Warlord, the carrot on the other side of these fictional details is always there. There's not reason to say, "Well, yeah. I don't care about this. Let's beat it." Because by engaging with it, in one way or another, they head for that treasure.<br/><br/>It simply is the easiest way, given the nature of the setup, to get the Players, via their PCs, into forward motion, pointed in generally the same direction. It's elegant, it's simple, it works.<br/><br/>Note that this has nothing to do with "reality." XP isn't about training or what the character did or learned or anything. It's a convention to build solid motion for the evening's entertainment and play. For some people that's a deal breaker. For me it is not. For me it simply an abstraction, just as Combat in OD&amp;D is an abstraction. It is, in fact, much like the suggestion from <i>Forward to Adventure</i> mentioned above. Because if the GM says, "Okay, I'm going to distribute enough treasure per dangerous environment to equal 1/4 of a level per PC," what he's really saying is, "Every adventure is worth about one quarter of a level. Go to four dangerous places, and you'll level." (In LotFP the recommendation is 4 environments per level for the first four levels, and then more environments per level as you rise in levels.)<br/><br/>The advantage of the Treasure = XP system over Adventure = XP, in my opinion, is that it hands the choice of how hard to work for that XP over to the Players.<br/><br/>Let's say the Players meet some horrible thing that is really tough. Like scary enough tough they might all die. But there's every reason to believe that if they can get past it, they're going to get some nice rubies out of the deal. (That's what the legends say!) So, do they go for it or not? They can always come back later, after they level. Or they can try it now. <br/><br/>I, as the GM, am not defining for the Players "what they adventure is." ("The Players defeat the troll to obtain the rubies.")  Instead the Players define the adventure with their choices -- which is as it should be in this kind of play. How hard they'll press themselves, how much a risk to take, how best to regroup and try again... all this is on the table for them to consider. With the Treasure/XP on the other side of fictional interactions, the game becomes about choosing how and why and when to interact with those pieces of fiction. And we all know, as a given, that they have to interact with and get past those fictional challenges -- in one way or another -- to get that treasure.<br/><br/>Thus, it <i>works</i>. Which is the thing I care about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424296">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424296/#Comment_424296" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-16T15:53:55+00:00" title="November 16, 2013  3:53PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Makes sense, but then it runs into the problem of <i> What do we do with all of this loot now???</i><br/><br/>That's when the dumb seems to kick in in my experience.

Below is the XP structure I settled on.  It ties the PCs to one another as a party, and to civilization.  That sets boundaries for the 'XP-for-treasure' focus.  The characters might adventure for any number of reasons, but they get XP for returning loot to civilization, as a team.  This dis-incentivizes getting in fights with monsters, and permits utter latitude in other character motivations- most PCs will be loot-hounds, but some will (either through emergent play or deliberate characterization) have oblique goals.  For me, that makes running and playing very easy.<br/><br/><i>Loot XP is from coins, gems, and jewelry taken from the dungeon, given once at its taxation by the magistrate (or other local authority), when taken to the magistrate as a party, divided by all living party members at the time of assessment.  Other valuables do not give XP, though the magistrate will be pissed if he or she finds out you didn\u2019t get them assessed and taxed.<br/><br/>Defeating monsters gives XP = (HD equivalent)^x10, divided among all PCs present at the time of its defeat.</i><br/><br/>I think I also ran a couple sessions that set quest goals worth XP, but I'm not invested in the players being strictly engaged by XP incentivization.  That said the game is eminently flexible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424300">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424300/#Comment_424300" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-16T16:08:16+00:00" title="November 16, 2013  4:08PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 16, 2013 6:33PM by lumpley.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eppy's suggestion was that if your bad experience points ever double your good experience points, screw it, you retire right then.<br/><br/>Eon's suggestion was that your bad experience points go toward leveling up, and you spend your good experience points for bonuses and short-term benefits in the dungeon.<br/><br/>If I were to write the price list, it would look like this:<br/><b>You're out of money.</b><br/>For each 100sp you used to have (or whatever, scale appropriately), choose 1, duplicates allowed:<br/>- You threw a party.<br/>- It was a pretty awesome party, and people are still talking about it.<br/>- You put up a friend for a while.<br/>- You had a romantic picnic with your special someone.<br/>- You went on a weekend bender.<br/>- You repaired and maintained all your gear.<br/>- You fed the hungry and clothed the poor.<br/>- You squirrelled some away against future bad luck.<br/>- etc.<br/><br/>-Vincent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424301">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424301/#Comment_424301" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-16T16:11:28+00:00" title="November 16, 2013  4:11PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 16, 2013 4:55PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Makes sense, but then it runs into the problem of <i> What do we do with all of this loot now???</i><br/><br/>That's when the dumb seems to kick in in my experience.

I thought it was a solid section, worth reading in full.<br/><br/>In short:<br/><br/>1) It needs to be secured or it will end up stolen.<br/>2) Invest in secure real estate with payments to retainers high enough to keep them loyal to keep it secure.<br/>3) He talks about becoming a minor warlord. Not easy! But doable! But if you're out and about being a minor warlord, you're not off having adventures in adventuring environments.

We want the <i>patina</i> of what's happening with that cash and what's happening outside of dungeons to build a sense of life and reality for the world... but what play is about, why we gather, is to have Adventurers enter Adventurous environments to have Adventures.

However, it's not the details that make it so, but rather that it's the single part of the design that is genuinely, clearly goal-oriented. The thing that makes D&amp;D special and unique in my rpg experience is that it is not about the experience of doing this or being that, but rather about achieving goals in play. If you take this away by messing with the scoring system, causing players to have ambiguous feelings about the purpose of play, that's a very fundamental change to how the game plays. It's the only rpg with an in-built high score list, you can't just take that away and expect it to continue working.<br/><br/>If you paid attention the above paragraph, then you'll note that I do not forbear all variations to the system, I am merely careful and suspicious of changes to the reward system that propagate into changes in the creative agenda. There are entirely valid variations on the theme that do not ruin the game for me:<br/>- Gaining xp for spending treasure instead of gaining it seems pointless to me; I understand that the difficulties it addresses are not issues at my tables here, and thus it doesn't seem useful. However, it does not ruin the reward cycle, as you're still clearly oriented towards getting the gold.<br/>- Finessing what counts as treasure is fine with me; if it helps you get to the challenge more reliably when you forbid adventurers from gaining xp by highway robbery or other perceived unchallenging means, then by all means close those off. I prefer to communicate this in a more technical manner, though: the issue is not "what is treasure" like e.g. LotFP makes it, but rather "what are we trying to accomplish in this scenario". There's nothing magical about monster gold in comparison to peasant gold that causes the former to give experience points, it's strictly a function of perceived challenge and goal-orientation.<br/>- Alternate experience models are fine with me as long as they are goal-oriented and not experience-oriented (xp for coming to play, xp for participating in an amusing scene, xp for saying something cool, etc.). Of course it would be preferable for such systems to also be analytically exact and unambiguous, to safeguard player rights and procedural hygiene. For example, the traditional quest xp reward is theoretically a very good idea, provided that you can make peace with two points: what happens if a player achieves the quest without knowing that it was in play, and how you determine the correct amount of xp to score from a given quest. If you won't stumble on those points, then there's no reason not to use generalized quest rewards.<br/><br/>On the other hand, there are many xp rules that I <i>do</i> find poisonous for D&amp;D. For example, xp for playing your character "well" (in AD&amp;D you got these as training cost discounts instead of xp bonuses, weirdly enough, but the principle is almost the same) has nothing to do with accomplishing goals, and therefore any xp count padded to any significant degree with such points fails entirely in providing the amusement that I look for in a xp system - that is, the experience points no longer correspond with actual character achievements. If you don't earn it by successful play, I fail to see how it's any different from a computer rpg hamster wheel at that point.<br/><br/>As regards practical application of the above principles, an amusing rule that has been making the rounds around here:<br/><br/><b>Declaring quests:</b> When your PC is starting on a new adventure that involves clearly non-monetary motivations, you may declare that your character is taking on a <i>quest</i> to resolve this whatever-it-is. Declaring a quest means that your character now gains only half xp for any treasure they find during the quest, but if they succeed in the deed, they'll gain an extra xp reward determined by the referee (in advance, in the open). I'm not entirely happy with my scheme for calculating the exact amount of the reward, but I'm confident it's an issue I can resolve after a bit more play.<br/><br/>The reason I find the above type of non-treasure xp rules useful is that they help us stretch the game organically when inevitably PCs <i>do</i> grow into more complex personalities who get mixed up in e.g. freedom fighting. The old, stupid Dragonlance way of handling that is to scatter unrealistic treasure here and there so that the players can tackle the challenges they find interesting, while still getting their xp credits for work well done. To me it's obvious that this is the wrong way to go: the thing to do is to generalize the xp system instead of carrying the dungeon-looting scoring device as a strange vestige into all other types of adventures that might be had.<br/><br/>And I mean, this is pretty important shit for advanced D&amp;D play! You don't need to play more than a couple dozen sessions to inevitably end up playing a character who e.g. has sworn loyalty to another character, and thus adventures as their faithful servant. (I've got a character like this currently.) So assuming they don't care about money, whyever should their success or failure be scored on that particular gauge? I'm not trying to get at that treasure because our game has expanded beyond that, so it's no longer working as a reliable device for measuring success.<br/><br/>I actually developed an alternate xp scoring device for romantic high fantasy old school D&amp;D last winter, specifically to point out and prove how ultimately arbitrary the xp-for-treasure thing is; you can switch it out for e.g. peons saved (my alternate system benchmarks one saved peon = 1xp), and as long as the system is analytically usable, non-ambivalent and goal-oriented, it'll work just as well. The scenarios, tactical concerns and such will merely be different when you're no longer attempting to collect treasure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424305">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424305/#Comment_424305" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-16T18:23:34+00:00" title="November 16, 2013  6:23PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the tips. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424307/#Comment_424307" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-16T18:46:32+00:00" title="November 16, 2013  6:46PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Majority XP for Gold</b><br/>This way, the game is about exploration. The XP is hidden in the dungeon, you need to find it without getting killed. Monsters are a hassle, mostly to be avoided, or fought if absolutely necessary to advance through the dungeon or if they are guarding treasure. PCs tend to become amoral, especially if XP is also split between them and their hirelings (because it is better for the PCs if the hirelings die in the dungeon).<br/><br/>Getting XP for spending gold is a pretty logical house rule that's been around from the beginning or something (Arneson, maybe?). Magic-Users can spend gold to get new spells, but otherwise, most gold expenditures seem to be for resurrection or ransoming captured PCs IME. Or building a castle. So you have 4th level fighters with more money than they know what to do with, yet they still go back into the dungeon.<br/><br/><b>Majority XP for Monsters</b><br/>This way leads to a major emphasis on encounters (like you find in 3rd+4th eds), and basically makes the game about killing things. I think this usually translates into "heroes vs. villains" kind of play, even though it sounds like "murderhobo" would be better used to describe this style instead of gold for XP.<br/><br/><b>Majority XP for other shit</b><br/>Getting XP for playing your character class, going on quests, good roleplaying, and even just showing up have all been tried, starting with house rules early on. In AD&amp;D they were always way more complicated than in games like Vampire. The Artesia game is probably the most overboard implementation of varied XP reward.<br/><br/>I like XP for going on declared quests for much the same reasons as Eero, but also because you can cut down on all the fiddly math and accounting that is the normal D&amp;D xp system.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>If you want something that's really "OSR-style" then you want to go with XP for gold. This of course means you need to stock the dungeon or have a proper random treasure table, but the majority of the OSR has been and probably still is firmly behind XP for gold.<br/><br/>The early versions of D&amp;D all seem to assume the gold you get comes from dungeons, not from robbing people. But then again, if you play B2: Keep on the Borderlands, all the best treasure is in the keep.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/biffboff" title="biffboff"><img alt="biffboff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/189/nI5NYQDMCBCPG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/biffboff">biffboff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424309/#Comment_424309" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-16T19:55:51+00:00" title="November 16, 2013  7:55PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All these recent OSR threads have got my teeth itchin'  to make a "Heartbreaker".

This thread has me thinking about the following Xp system (feel free to tear it apart; I'm not married to it, we're just courting at the moment):<br/><br/>    Gain Xp on a failed roll. <br/><br/>That's it. How much is a matter of scale; say 1 per current level (or 100 x level if mirroring the trend to level up in the 1000's; adjust to taste).<br/><br/>The benefits (I think) are:<br/><br/>The justification (if required) is that you learn more from your mistakes than your triumphs.<br/><br/>It softens the pass/fail dichotomy; hey, at least you got Xp.<br/><br/>It encourages engagement with the adventure/environment. "Ya don't try nuthin' , ya don't get nuthin'." This is the big one, to my mind. Do you want to sit in the tavern drinking ale or do you want to go "down there" and do (or at least try) stuff.  Who wants to go in the room first? Who wants to stick their hand in the stone carving's mouth? Who wants to approach the pretty lady who's been (suspiciously) very careful to keep her waist below the water line of the cavern pool?<br/><br/>    Gold, as a reward system. only has as much value as the game (and players) put on it. It's play-money, Monopoly money. It's as important or as meaningless as saving the Princess. There will always be more treasure to be had; there will always be somebody to save or kill. The important thing is that you are doing stuff. And that means dice rolls. Attacks, saving throws, disarming traps, turning undead, whatever.<br/><br/>  Note that I'm not claiming this can just be tacked on to any OSR system. D&amp;D magic users, for example, rarely roll for their spell success (although a monster's successful save could translate to a M.U.'s failure).<br/><br/>  Also, it is not Goal oriented. You can always beat feet and come back later to save the Princess, still having gained some Xp.

XP is implicated in the fiction of the game\u2014by increasing power, sure, which we can call an abstraction of "learning to be better at your job" or something, but also because there is a number of points that you get to and then people start to refer to you as a baron. What is XP in the fiction?<br/><br/>I am interested in XP for gold (I give it for both bringing the gold back and for spending it on carousing or questing) in ways that directly interact the fiction. So: using XP amounts as guidelines for weregild to be paid on wrongful deaths. Or determining how much the dwarf is worth when he's been polymorphed into a diamond.

As characters meet monsters in mortal combat and defeat them, and when they obtain various formsof treasure (money, gems, jewelry, magical items, etc.), they gain "experience".This adds to their experience point total, gradually moving them upwards through the levels. Gains in experience points will be relative; thus an 8th level Magic-User operating on the 5th dungeon level would be awarded 5/8 experience. Let us assume he gains 7,000 Gold Pieces by defeating a troll (which is a 7th level mon-ster, as it has over 6 hit dice). Had the monster been only a 5th level one experience would be awarded on a 5/8 basis as already stated, but as the monster guarding the treasure was a 7th level one experience would be awarded on a 7/8 basis thus;7,000 G.P. + 700 for killing the troll = 7,700 divided by 8 = 962.5 x 7 = 6,037.5.Experience points are never awarded above a 1 for 1 basis, so even if a character defeats a higher level monster he will not receive experience points above the total of treasure combined with the monster's kill value. It is also recommendedthat no more experience points be awarded for any single adventure than will suffice to move the character upwards one level. Thus a "veteran" (1st level) gains what would ordinarily be 5,000 experience points; however, as this would move him upwards two levels, the referee should award only sufficient points to bring him to "warrior" (2nd level), say 3,999 if the character began with 0 experience points.</blockquote>\nSo, at the dawn of time PCs got XP for both killing beasts and grabbing treasure. With some math regarding level of PC vs. level of monster, and bonuses for prime requisite scores.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424340">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C.Jay" title="C.Jay"><img alt="C.Jay" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C.Jay">C.Jay</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424340/#Comment_424340" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-17T22:38:58+00:00" title="November 17, 2013 10:38PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is it safe to say that most of this "5/8's" stuff was house-ruled away very early on?

One thing I was never clear on with gold = XP editions was whether I could get XP by scamming villagers instead of going into dungeons. Say I'm a low level mage with a few cool cantrips, could I just hang around selling snake oil and "love potions" until I get high enough level to cast fireball? (My friends were always looking at me suspiciously when I would ask questions like this. It was really unfair.)</blockquote>\nNo. <br/><br/><b>Giving Experience Points</b>, p. B22, Dungeons &amp; Dragons Fantasy Adventure Game Basic Rulebook (1981):<br/><br/>"For every 1 gp value of non-magical treasure the characters recover, the DM should give 1 XP to the party (this will be divided among all the player characters). Experience points are not given for magic items."<br/><br/>In other words, only treasure hauled out of a dungeon as part of an adventure counts. <br/><br/>Also, stealing from other party members in the hopes of gaining experience is pointless (from the same page):<br/>"DIVIDING XP: Treasure is divided by the party, but the DM handles all the XP awards. At the end of an adventure, the DM totals the XP from all treasure recovered plus all monsters defeated and then divides the total by the number of surviving characters (both player characters and NPCs) in the party. EXAMPLE: A party of 7 (5 player characters and 2 NPCs) goes on an adventure but only 6 come back alive. They killed monsters for a total of 800 XP and also collected 5800 gp in treasure for a total of 6600 XP. Each character receives 1100 XP at the end of the adventure."<br/><br/>As for the original question, I think this system is fantastic for this game. It is a feedback mechanism just like Artha in Burning Wheel. It exists to shape the behavior of the players in the game. You only need to play a few sessions to brutally understand that fighting monsters is not worth the cost, but getting any treasure they may be guarding <i>is</i>. This leads to the realization that Charisma is probably the most important stat on your character sheet, because a good Charisma gives you the option to parley and come out ahead. Then you realize that an invisibility potion isn't about getting in a surprise attack, it's about letting a party member with infravision scout <i>and map!</i> the complex so you can better plan your expedition, avoiding meaningless combat and getting to the loot. It's what makes lower-level D&amp;D a heist, not a monster-fighting game.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424353">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424353/#Comment_424353" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-18T08:01:55+00:00" title="November 18, 2013  8:01AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 18, 2013 8:05AM by komradebob.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man, lots of folks singing the praises of GP=XP.<br/><br/>I can't possibly be the only fan of OS mechanical approaches who has some doubts about that, can I?<br/><br/>I do see positives.<br/><br/>1)Leveling up is fun, you get a cool character who can do neater stuff, and the slow process of leveling up means you can slowly learn what your character can do with their new abilities as you get them ( and in the context of group abilities).<br/><br/>2) It does give a pretty direct goal, especially in a dungeon-of-the-week+sandbox region set up.<br/><br/>3) It des allow for fun real people social mongering/bragging rights, especially in a big player pool/random group of players this session context.<br/><br/>4) It doesn't require much in the way of GM judgment calls.

You have to make an interpretation here, by the way, because nowhere in the text does it actually tell you specifically how much XP monsters are worth. This interpretation is totally Jossed, but I like it. It means, for one thing, that wandering monsters aren't worth XP, and since wandering monsters are produced by the passage of time (I forget the specific number, but you make a wandering monster roll every time a certain number of turns pass) and represent nothing but a loss of resources, the players get very, very serious about time management. Also, since the XP of the treasure far exceeds the XP of the monster, you have incentive to bypass the monster if at all possible and go directly for the treasure. I like to incentivize that because I like to see it happen; the point of System is to get my friends to say cool things, and that's something I consider cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424417">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/E.T.Smith" title="E.T.Smith"><img alt="E.T.Smith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1090/buddyicons/8542318@N07.jpg?1180909196"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/E.T.Smith">E.T.Smith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424417/#Comment_424417" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-18T22:43:40+00:00" title="November 18, 2013 10:43PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my last couple S&amp;W games, I've tried awarding encounter XP for <i>any</i> interaction with potentially hostile people or monsters.

The encounter xp is a joke anyway in my play, mathematically speaking, so it doesn't really change anything except player attitudes to make it so "experiencing danger" gives the xp instead of the arbitrary "defeat enemy". We're anyways in the habit of flirting with giving "monster" xp for disarming traps and whatever, so why the heck not - I find it easy to give players these small amounts of points if they find it amusing and it makes them happy, speaking as a GM.<br/><br/>Then again, I could also see myself giving out some other type of xp for encounters and such, as opposed to treasure - they're really entirely different processes, there's no real reason for treating them identically. Vincent's earlier insight about "good" and "bad" experiences is amusing in this regard. I would perhaps term it so that there are "experience points" and "success points", with the latter being what you get for succeeding, and the former being what you get by literally experiencing (usually bad) things. (What you'd do with these is incidental to the point, really - easy enough to think up the consequences of amassing the points.) From what I've seen of play, this might work psychologically quite well, considering how players think.<br/><br/>Thinking along these lines, it would make sense to have the encounter xp be scaled not to beastie size, but rather to the intensity of the experience. So you'd get this much for sighting the dragon, this much for interacting with it, this much for almost getting eaten by it, etc. I'll have to think on this, and determine whether I'm willing to go this far from the historical cornerstones of D&amp;D mechanics in my evolving play <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424419">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424419/#Comment_424419" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-18T23:45:56+00:00" title="November 18, 2013 11:45PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/>That's pretty much exactly what I came up with for Madlands, except that the "success points" were pretty much strictly a matter of in-game resources and positioning.

The rule says, "XP for spending treasure".  However, the appeal of the game (to my group, anyway) is mostly about being roguish and awesome and having dramatic adventures.  That's what our GM provided, and we all liked it.<br/><br/>This created a disconnect with the XP system, though.<br/><br/>We'd get to the end of an arc -- endeavor, mission, plot point, whatever -- and say, "Time for any bookkeeping!"  The GM would then either play up any stuff we'd found as "treasure" or tack some treasure onto the end of the adventure so we had some.  Or the players would suggest stuff.  In one case, our characters sold all the property of an absent NPC nemesis.<br/><br/>Then the GM would ask, "So how do you <i>part</i> with that treasure?"  And I'm thinking, "My character really has no interest in spending this right here and now before the next thing on our to-do list.  But I want the XP, so I'll come up with something."<br/><br/>Being forced to cook up something to do with some money was actually fun in its own way.  It made for a nice additional requirement for play, to force a certain dynamic into the narrative about the patterns of such characters' lives, which we all <i>did</i> like on a macro level.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if we'd gained XP for finishing adventures, that would have put the formal and informal rewards of play much more in synch.<br/><br/>As for D&amp;D, my favorite option was always "XP for killing monsters" because my GMs created "defeat this monster" challenges rather than "get to this treasure" challenges.  But I think this is more an AD&amp;D2 thing (where the book lists monster XP values) than an OSR thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428396">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428396/#Comment_428396" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-18T17:37:25+00:00" title="February 18, 2014  5:37PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very interesting discussion here. I'm firmly in the camp of "XP for treasure", myself, because it allows people to be creative, and incentivizes clever play. Getting treasure out of a dungeon is more of a puzzle, more demanding of lateral thinking, than "kill that monster".<br/><br/>In my experience with some OSR-style play, yes, there is a LOT of math involved. You've got to add up all the XPs for monsters killed or encountered (I like giving points simply for encountering a dangerous creature - it feeds into the "play as discovery/exploration" mode), calculate quantities of treasure found, apply modifiers like prime attribute bonuses or experience penalties for someone violating their alignment (in some versions of the game), etc, etc, and finally divide it all by the number of players. It's not uncommon for a calculator to come out at this stage, or a spreadsheet.<br/><br/>On one hand, this is not terribly elegant game design. On the other hand, it becomes a neat way to keep score, to track defeats and victories, to recount everything that happened in a given session, and a sort of game ritual you can use to close out the session. This can feel quite satisfying (or crushing, after you realize that your dungeon delve cost you 400 gold pieces to finance, you lost two henchmen and a PC, and all you're getting out of it is about 20 coins each and 75 XPs).<br/><br/>I keep thinking of variations which deal with *how* you deal with the treasure, myself. We all know that we want our heroes to find treasure and advance in experience and ability, but we also don't want them to amass ridiculous quantities of treasure and hire other people to do their adventuring for them. <br/><br/>Here are some thoughts I've had:<br/><br/>* You get a certain number of experience points for recovering treasure from a dungeon. If you're willing to waste that hard-earned cash on frivolous pursuits (i.e. not related to your adventuring goals), like drinking, having a statue made of the heroes, throwing parties, etc, you get some more experience (maybe the same amount again, maybe a lesser amount).<br/><br/>So here you can decide whether you wish to reinvest the wealth towards your adventuring career, or go waste it all and gain experience faster. You can be a thoughtful, prepared adventurer who advances slowly, or a rash, fame-seeking, crazy fool who racks up experience much faster, should he survive.<br/><br/>* In my game OSR-inspired game <i>Kroll</i>, each adventurer who survives long enough should have a Dream: some lofty goal the character is striving for, like retiring safely, marrying her beloved, or returning to the country from which they were exiled.<br/><br/>When you recover Treasure from a dungeon, you score experience. But now you can do one of two things: 1. you can spend it on adventuring goals (better equipment, hirelings, whatever), or 2. put it aside in your Stash, which goes towards accomplishing your Dream. When you decide your character is ready to retire, the amount you've got in your Stash determines your odds of achieving your Dream. It's a gamble, and we all get to hear about how the former adventurer found their happy ending (or not).<br/><br/>Another interesting model might be any kind of fictional situation which requires the PCs to collect wealth towards a non-adventuring related goal. For example:<br/><br/>* The PCs are working for a mysterious patron who provides them with some resources, or information on locations where treasure can be found. However, they have to hand over the treasure recovered to him. (And score XPs when they hand it over.)<br/><br/>* The PCs are a bunch of heroes trying to raise money to ransom the King's daughter, so any treasure found goes into a pool, hoping to reach whatever amount they need to rescue her.<br/><br/>This allows you to connect fictional events or goals with treasure recovered. I haven't tried this one myself, however!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428406/#Comment_428406" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-19T08:58:28+00:00" title="February 19, 2014  8:58AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Coming out of lurk mode to share some thoughts. Big fan of Eero's OSR writings here Though he might not know it yet, he's been very influential in re-kindling interest in older modes of play within my group. <br/><br/>Reading through my '81 B/X (finally physical copies!) it suggests that meeting attribute requisites grants PCs +5% or +10% to any XP PCs receive through spending gold or overcoming monsters. I like this little mechanic (especially as, even while the DM divides the XP fairly between all survivors, the final "scoring" for the adventure is different for each player) and although I've yet to unpack all its consequences I reckon it could be wildly implemented in the "spend gold for xp" section of play to encourage different non dungeon-oriented activities.<br/><br/><i>e.g.</i><br/><br/><i>-Clerics/Magic-Users/Theives: +10% XP for gold given to your church/order/guild.</i><br/><br/><i>-Fighters/Dwarves: +10% XP for gold spent on carousing.</i><br/><br/><i>-Halflings: +10% XP for gold spent on comfort and consumable luxuries. </i><br/><br/>etc. Dunno what Elves spend their gold on. They seem to get more additional XP (or more chances for additional XP, having two possible prime requisites) so maybe they get left out, or can pick and choose depending on the style of the elf in question.<br/><br/>It could even be used to retro-emulate classes added in later editions (although much simplified):<br/><br/><i>e.g.<br/><br/>-Paladin: Earn +10% XP for acting according to alignment/deity<br/><br/>-Barbarian: Earn +10% XP for each combat you initiate. </i><br/><br/>Ok, so I haven't quite worked the nitty-gritty of this out but I can feel there's something here.

The Prime Requisite Bonuses are a lure to encourage players to choose classes that correspond well to their stats (making for more effective adventurers). It's symptomatic of the hands-off "rulings, not rules" tone of the B/X books - no one is being coerced into playing a fighter but if you have high STR it's certainly tempting. Or, at least, that's how I see it. <br/><br/>Also, fiction-wise, it's a good reinforcement tool - linking the PCs (as a collection of stats) with their in-game strengths as characters <i>i.e.</i> the fighter is strong and is rewarded for his strength. I think someone said something above (or in another osr thread... who?) about the classes being central to PC motivations. The fighter <i>is</i> someone motivated by fighting. This is tied to that. I think.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/adamwb" title="adamwb"><img alt="adamwb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/adamwb">adamwb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428411/#Comment_428411" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-19T11:11:57+00:00" title="February 19, 2014 11:11AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the white box, Strength, Intelligence and Wisdom don't give any numerical bonuses at all, except for XP ones for each class.

So there's not that imbalance here, although I'm unsure of all the ways the White Box differs to my Red and Blue. Although I reckon that magic weapons (the prime magic item), giving +1 - +3 adjustment to combat roles, soon mean that players are getting the same adjustments to STR- and DEX-based rolles.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428436">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/adamwb" title="adamwb"><img alt="adamwb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/adamwb">adamwb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428436/#Comment_428436" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-20T01:22:11+00:00" title="February 20, 2014  1:22AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The STR chart first appeared in Supplement I: Greyhawk, as well as the Thief.

Hirelings, on the other hand, don't get XP and are generally NPCs dudes you keep around to guard stuff and bear torches. <br/>Now, I'm not sure if I'm remembering this right - so perhaps Hirelings do get some small percentage of XP. I'm sure someone will know. <br/>But either way I'd just like to draw the conversation over to look at the weird XP-sidegame the players can run off and play outside the auspices of the DM. They can effectively raise a pokemon squad of talented adventurers to utilize later (as pawns or successors), weighing pure hireling numbers vs. levelling specific campions in terms of how the XP is shared out. <br/>I'm not certain I've got my finger on it yet, but this seems much more in-line with XP for Treasure, this idea of every adventurer getting a share as decided by the players like bandits divvying up their loot.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428442/#Comment_428442" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-20T06:00:50+00:00" title="February 20, 2014  6:00AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Potemkin:<br/>If you like hirelings/retainers/henchmen, you might want to look into some of the minis campaign games that exist.

I played a little regular Warhammer as a younger man but those spin-offs always intrigued me. Squad-play sounds fun, but doesn't expect the roleplay that D&amp;D requires as a part of the DM/Player Information/Fictional-positioning exchange, right? - which is a little off-putting. I'm here for the story after all. <br/><br/>Seeing as D&amp;D stems out of wargaming, I can see that cousinship that bonds the two franchises, but D&amp;D is just a more <i>literary </i> experience as opposed to purely tactical - so therein lies some appeal. <br/><br/>I love the idea of trying to negotiate the activities of a crowd of PCs trying to organise, survive and claim their share of the loot. I must try out the <i>Dungeon Crawl Classics </i>0-Level PC funnel in all its sadistic squad-roleplaying glory.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428586">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428586/#Comment_428586" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-21T18:30:37+00:00" title="February 21, 2014  6:30PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's an excerpt from a D&amp;D text you might enjoy:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.headinjurytheater.com/dnd%20orgy%20rules%201.jpg" rel="nofollow">D&amp;D Orgy Rules Excerpt</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428596">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428596/#Comment_428596" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-21T19:51:48+00:00" title="February 21, 2014  7:51PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Potemkin: Not talking about the battle game so much as the between battles rules and gang development rules                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428852">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vanveen" title="Vanveen"><img alt="Vanveen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vanveen">Vanveen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428852/#Comment_428852" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-26T14:21:03+00:00" title="February 26, 2014  2:21PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am considering the "blow it and get XP" vs. "take it out and get XP" rules.<br/><br/>Maybe you get X for taking it out, 1/2 X again for blowing it--spending it on just about anything that doesn't directly benefit you. Tithes to the church? Yeah (although don't count on building up a stock of goodwill or anything). General carousing? Yeah. Helping the poor? Yeah. Hiring people to go out and cause general mayhem, as an evil character? Probably, with a bit of thinking. Saving it for later or buying equipment? No. <br/><br/>This also extends to something I've actually found true IRL. The sort of people who would enter dungeons, or even try to go out and find some treasure somewhere, are arguably very like the sort of people who found businesses (especially consulting businesses) or who Get Ahead. The aggressive risk-taking is part of the whole thing. They are constantly winning and losing fortunes...because they are convinced they can continue to make money, no matter what. It is hard to believe unless you've seen it for yourself, but many such people are radically different from folks who want to have a job and a career and settle down. They get fired a lot but always seem to bounce back with something bigger. They also tend to live high when they're able...this kind of fearlessness makes them who they are.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18996/osr-xp-for-treasure-vs-xp-for-non-treasure" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18996/osr-xp-for-treasure-vs-xp-for-non-treasure" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18996/osr-xp-for-treasure-vs-xp-for-non-treasure/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F18996%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F18996%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
