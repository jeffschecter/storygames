What game were they playing?  What were they expecting? What actually happened when they tried to play?  What worked, what didn't?

Nor the rules. It speaks to how players engage each other, using the rules, in actual play.<br/><br/>So we can't tel you what happens, given a Venn Diagram like above. Did the group, through some psychic Brownian motion, agitate themselves until they were all squarely in the ABC intersection? Or did the game fall apart due to a tug-of-war and ensuing frustrations? Or did one particular player (the GM, maybe?) steer the group into the best possible intersection? Or did the group "take turns" hopping from one intersection to another, or even to each others exclusive "only A, B, or C" regions?<br/><br/>The answers to those questions (and more) will show you whether play was coherent or dysfunctional. Further examples of what A, B, and C were--and how fully each or all players engaged with each one, while in their Brownian stage--will tell you the Creative Agenda (or conflicting Agendas) for that group.<br/><br/>In short, TBM doesn't say "Game X is suck because it's incoherent." At MOST, it might say "Game X has rules that serve conflicting Agendas, and so a given group will have to cherry-pick or play round-robin-style to avoid incoherence." TBM's primary purpose is post-play, to help you figure out why THIS group, THIS day, didn't get at the awesome, and where in the totality of the Model they got derailed. There's more to TBM than GNS.<br/><br/>All that said: it's not the Swiss Army Knife of RPG theory. For instance, it seems to utterly ignore live action gaming, which (with larger, campaign groups) happily supports "incoherent" play through round-robin (or even blatant isolation of conflicting Agendas). But, then again, I don't think it was ever intended to look at anything but the very narrow table-top, character and situation-driven RPG world.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138158">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138158/#Comment_138158" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-04T11:23:44+00:00" title="April  4, 2008 11:23AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 4, 2008 11:38AM by Max Higley.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't want to do something fundamentally different than the Big Model, I want to go <i>beyond</i> the Big Model, while including its best parts.

The second one is where we differ:<br/><br/>Hypothetical Abstracted Details + Big Model = Potentially Useful Abstract Advice, Ready to Have Specifics Added As Necessary.<br/><br/>The key is that it isn't something you can apply <i>yet</i>.  Of course you can't get out predictions that are more specific than the details you feed in.  But you can still feed in more details.  The notion that differing CAs are likely to cause conflicts is precisely "Potentially Useful Abstract Advice Ready to Have Specifics Added As Necessary."  And we can predict that without details of Actual Play.  We can get more specific predictions of how those conflicts might arise by adding more details (which CAs are conflicting, for example, or details about the actual specific expectations of each player.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138211">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138211/#Comment_138211" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-04T13:45:11+00:00" title="April  4, 2008  1:45PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Give Max a break, folks, it's an honest question. Theory questions, while potentially problematic, are still valid questions. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'll give it a stab. If the players have perfect understanding of the other preferences of the other players, with whom they have overlapping CA then each player either thinks that he won't have any problems with the mixed (incoherent, to use the term from the model) play, or perhaps he believes he can get the other players to play the way he prefers. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor the player who thinks there won't be problems, this will be true, or it won't. If true, then happy incoherent play goes on. If false, then play is dysfunctional for that player. For the converting player, either he will make his converts, or he won't. For the player making the converts, he'll do fine. For the player who doesn't, he'll either have to resign himself to playing an inchoerent game, or find the game dysfunctional. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's one of the myths of the big model and GNS categorizations in particular on the CA level that the model claims that incoherent play is automatically dysfunctional. It does not. It just says that it's often a source of problems in play. That people who have substantively different creative agendas are participating in an activity that is different enough that they might find the play of the others a distraction, or even find it to be "wrong." Which is just a strong statement that the play in question bugs them. <br/>\n<br/>\nPerfect understanding of the other player's Creative Agendas is rarely forthcoming, I would note. One of the advantages to game designs that promote a focused CA is that you don't have to worry as much. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat is, the way I look at it, few people's "preferences" are so strong that they can't enjoy other creative agendas than this preference. As such, while they might like to play in one creative agenda slightly less than in another, that's not the same as saying that they won't enjoy it at all. Meaning that for many groups it may be more important to be on the same sheet of music in terms of creative agenda, than it is to have any one specific creative agenda. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen and where somebody really detests a particular Creative Agenda, a focused game that promotes a different Creative Agenda than that preference is just not for them. Some people see this as a flaw, but others do not. The question becomes whether or not it's more important to have coherent play, or have freedom to play in any way you like. Given that you're choosing to play by a pariticular set of rules, and limiting ourselves in other ways, I'd argue that it seems strange to then want to leave in this flexibility, but that's my own bias. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138212">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138212/#Comment_138212" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-04T13:59:02+00:00" title="April  4, 2008  1:59PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 4, 2008 1:59PM by Max Higley.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent answer Mike.

The question is about the dynamics in reaching that point.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Levi Kornelsen</cite>Beyond that, what does the experimaent mean / what is it intended to show?</blockquote>\nFirst, that while the question can't be completely answered with the information given, some predictions can be made.  Even this seems to escape many people -- though it is a highly efficient solution to deny the question altogether.  Second, that there are two bases for such predictions: the structure of the Big Model or something else.  In the Big Model case, the predictions must remain abstract because there isn't enough structure to get very specific.  In the something else case, the predictions may be very specific, but will suffer semantic issues as individuals create their own structure to fill the gaps.  As a consequence, we have to either settle for vague and useless predictions, or wait for the weight of differing individual definitions to catch up to the predictions and render them incomprehensible (and therefore useless.)  Unless, of course, we create more structure.<br/><br/>All of which is to say: structurally speaking, the players need to be explicitly included in a model in order to explore this avenue with any more than cursory depth.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138221">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138221/#Comment_138221" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-04T14:34:33+00:00" title="April  4, 2008  2:34PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 4, 2008 2:47PM by Levi Kornelsen.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Max Higley</cite>The question is about the dynamics in reaching that point.</blockquote>\nRight.

In other words, I think it gives people a way to dismiss predictive theories.  "Keep your science off my roleplaying."  Bah.<br/><br/>Let me sidetrack for a moment and talk about how to gather knowledge.  In every field where we can use observation, it goes like this:<br/>1) Injunction.  This is an instruction.  "Do this, and you will experience this."<br/>2) Apprehension.  You have some direct knowing of what's happening, and of whether or not you are experiencing what you expected.<br/>3) Confirmation.  You check your apprehension with a community of people who have also followed the injunction.<br/><br/>For example, I want to know what temperature water boils at.  First, I have to follow the injunction: put water in a beaker, add a thermometer, and heat it.  If I do that, I can watch the thermometer and see what temperature it registers when the water boils -- that's the apprehension.  Let's say I observe that the water boils at 101C.  Then I check with other people: "Did your water boil at 101C?"  We see that there's some variation, depending on say altitude, but that generally it boils around 100C.  Great, we have some "new" knowledge.<br/><br/>That's a "sciency" example, but we can equally well apply it in other realms.  Meditation has precisely the same thing going on.  "Do this (meditate), and you will experience this."  That's how one becomes a Zen Master -- perform the injunction until you have a certain experience, then have that experience confirmed by other people who have had it.<br/><br/>Now, what is an injunction?  <i>It's precisely a prediction about what will happen.</i><br/><br/>So...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>But it is not a "theory" [...]. It is, rather, a descriptive model. Hence the "Model" part of "the Big Model".</blockquote>\n...if a description produces no injunctions, it's not even really a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(abstract)" rel="nofollow">model</a>.  It's just a "description of your own experiences," as Mendel said.  You can use such a description to talk to other people about your experiences, but you can't use it to improve or even change anything, because you can't figure out how to <i>do</i> anything in the future with it.  I don't personally believe the Big Model is that, or I would start calling it "the Big Description," (or, to be really accurate, "the Medium Description.")<br/><br/>There are injunctions to be had from TBM.  Any time you can figure out how to do things in the future, then there is at least an implied injunction.  The typical use of diagnosing what went wrong with a session after the session using the Big Model has an implied injunction -- if you know what went wrong, and if you avoid doing that again, you shouldn't suffer the same problem in the future.  "Do this and you will experience this.  Don't do this, and you won't experience this."  Many of the Big Modelian injunctions have to do with CA clash.  "Put a Simulationist and a Narrativist in the same game.  These are the sorts of conflict you're likely to see."  Or, in the reverse, "If you want to avoid these sorts of conflicts, get everybody on the same page about which CA family you're pursuing."  That's something that tightly focused games like DitV do quite well -- the rules of the game force you to play in a certain way, and since the group is all playing the same way, particular sorts of conflicts are unlikely to arise.  That development is a direct consequence of the theory, in the sense that it can be derived directly from the theory (regardless of how it actually came to be.)<br/><br/>So, the Big Model does have some injunctions that can be followed, and in that sense is really no different than physics or meditation instructions.  We don't need a "scientific" theory, we simply need an injunctive theory.  "Do this, and you will experience this."  In the Big Model, we already have a decent base to build on.  However, because the structure of the Big Model is exceedingly general and often inconsistent, the injunctions it can form are exceedingly general and often inconsistent.  Because of the structural flaws (of which I believe failing to explicitly include individual players is one), Big Modelian injunctions are rarely all that specific or reliable.  I don't think that's a reason to dismiss the model wholesale -- I think it's a reason to improve the structure, in order to form better injunctions and collect some new knowledge about the inner workings of roleplaying.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
