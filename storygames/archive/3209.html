Apologies in advance for the long post.<br/><br/>For starters, here is the game\xe2\u20ac\u2122s description:\n<blockquote>The day started out with a bang\xe2\u20ac\u201dthe bad kind\xe2\u20ac\u201dand just got worse from there. Intel confirms there\xe2\u20ac\u2122s still one dirty bomb loose in the city, in the hands of a madman, and only you and the rest of the CTU team stand between him and the good people of L.A. You won\xe2\u20ac\u2122t be deterred. You can\xe2\u20ac\u2122t be killed. But you can run out of time, and in the end that\xe2\u20ac\u2122s an even worse fate.</blockquote>\nAnd a little about Bullseye:<br/><br/>Bullseye represents a progression from d20 to the system in Passages to a fully re-imagined d20-based mechanic with a greater emphasis on what I\xe2\u20ac\u2122d like to call narrative play. (Note: \xe2\u20ac\u0153narrative\xe2\u20ac\x9d is not capitalized, and it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s not intended to carry with it the baggage attendant to \xe2\u20ac\u0153Narrativism\xe2\u20ac\x9d with the big \xe2\u20ac\u0153N\xe2\u20ac\x9d.<br/><br/>One of the developments I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m implementing is alternate \xe2\u20ac\u0153fluid qualities\xe2\u20ac\x9d. (I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve gone back and forth with a couple of different names, but that\xe2\u20ac\u2122s what I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m using right now.) Generally, these are character qualities that can diminish and/or grow over the course of the game as compared to fixed qualities that are, over the short term, fixed. Looking at D&amp;D, Strength, Dexterity, Skill bonuses, BAB, etc. are fixed; hit points are fluid. My initial forays into alternate fluid qualities include things like faith, sanity, etc. These can also include broader categories, e.g., the status of a criminal organization (for my police procedural setting). But, like Andrew, I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve always wanted a game that could simulate the tension achieved by 24\xe2\u20ac\u2122s countdown clock. So, I knew I wanted to be able to use time as another fluid quality. Indeed, the selection of the particular fluid quality gives a lot of focus to what the particular game is about: faith, sanity, time, etc.<br/><br/>In Bullseye, the way fluid qualities work is similar to hit points in D&amp;D. The important exception being the development I made in Passages. Only a d20 is used, so there are no alternate dice to determine damage. Damage is based on spread, which is the difference between the result of the check and the result of the target number or opposed check. This spread is modified based on the damage modifier of the weapon being used. So, let\xe2\u20ac\u2122s say Betty stabs Chuck with a knife (damage modifier +1 for the sake of the example). Betty gets a 17 on her check to attack; Chuck gets a 12 on his check to defend. The spread is 5. Modifying this by the weapon\xe2\u20ac\u2122s damage modifier yields 6 points of damage. Simple.<br/><br/>This general framework can be extrapolated to all sorts of other fluid qualities. Let\xe2\u20ac\u2122s say I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m running a CoC-style campaign and using sanity as my fluid quality. Betty encounters a horrible tentacled creature and must make a check. She gets a 12 on her check to resist; the creature gets a 17 on its check (sanity modifier +2 for the sake of example). The spread is 5. Modifying this by the creature\xe2\u20ac\u2122s insanity modifier yields 7 points off her sanity.<br/><br/>Now, how do we apply that to the issue of time? Using time adds the slight wrinkle that even completely successful actions (e.g., winning the firefight) take some time. So, the spread will determine how much or less time the action takes than it should on average. So, Betty is trying to hack into the terrorist intranet. We\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll say this would normally take 30 minutes. Betty gets a 17 on her hacking check; the terrorists get a 12 on their network defense check. The spread is 5. So, instead of taking 30 minutes, it only takes her 25 minutes.<br/><br/>But that\xe2\u20ac\u2122s just the basic mechanic. Think about what that does to gameplay. Note that the characters don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t have hit points. Note in the description of the game that they can\xe2\u20ac\u2122t be killed. Just like Jack Bauer, we know they aren\xe2\u20ac\u2122t going to die. But failing their combat check in the big shootout means it takes them <b>longer</b> to accomplish the task. Narratively, we\xe2\u20ac\u2122re free to address this as flavorfully as possible. Maybe the team has trouble picking off the defenders; maybe one of the team members is badly injured, requiring time-wasting medical attention; etc.<br/><br/>Finally, I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve decided to use tokens as a prop for the game. At the start of the game, there are 180 tokens in the middle of the table, representing the number of minutes the players have until the last suitcase nuke goes off. Each time they do something, we take tokens out of the pool. When the make their check, we give a few back or take a few more away depending on the spread. Thus, as we reach the climax of the game, and there are only a handful of tokens left in the game, I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m hopeful things will get nice and tense. In fact, I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m hoping that one player is left to defuse the bomb, and I slowly start taking the last few tokens out of the pool as he calls on all his team\xe2\u20ac\u2122s resources to get the job done.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_73175">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anemone" title="Anemone"><img alt="Anemone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.tlucretius.net/temp/anemone_icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anemone">Anemone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73175/#Comment_73175" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-01T11:24:30+00:00" title="June  1, 2007 11:24AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Justin, have you taken a look at John Wick's <i>Wilderness of Mirrors</i>?

Hot off the press as it were, as he hand stapled them the morning of GC SoCal. Note, however, that WoM measures actual time spent by the players in the planning phase. So, it is <i>not</i> a good method of emulating an in-game countdown.<br/><br/>Perhaps my explanation of Bullseye wasn't on the mark. It is, by way of comparison, far simpler than d20 by an order of magnitude. And there's no real "accounting" to be done as the resources are sitting on the table, out in the open. But I grant you, it is also more meatier than WoM, if that's what we're comparing it to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_73386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ihmcallister" title="ihmcallister"><img alt="ihmcallister" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ihmcallister">ihmcallister</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73386/#Comment_73386" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-02T15:17:40+00:00" title="June  2, 2007  3:17PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have a countdown mechanic in Stitch but it actually works as a count up. The players have 30 mins to achieve a certain set of tasks within a knot, the fundamental missions of the game. They have skills ranked 5/10/15 and a set of belief &amp; repsonsibilities ranked 5/10 &amp; 15 as well. At the start of a knot a count up clock is started and never stops. That is important. When the gm asks for a check, you check your skill against the minutes passed. If it is more that than value you pass, otherwise you fail. Players and Gm can bring in beliefs and responsibilities to increase and decreases skills. This happens very quickfire and little arguing happens as the clock is always running. <br/><br/>This gives the feeling of pressure you need from a countdown game and means there is no mucking about with mechanics at all.I have <a href="http://www.collective-endeavour.com/node/277" rel="nofollow">playtested</a> it once and it went really well.  There is a lot of polish needed but I really feel that Stitch is going to be something special.

I was just mentioning on the Big Con thread that I'm also noodling with a 1-on-1 hitman setting where the target has a security pool that the player has to erode before he can make the kill. \n<blockquote>So do all the players share their time ratings, so when one takes a "hit" they all do?

I'm still fiddling with it, but so far it looks like it should work.\n<blockquote>I like the idea of the dwindling pool of points! Is there a risk of the game coming to a climax prematurely? Say, they have some spectacular failures early on?</blockquote>\nI'd say there is a very small risk of that happening, which I would probably deal with by pulling out a little handwavium. I don't mind a "TPK" in my home game, but I'd feel like a big dick if I did that at GC.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
