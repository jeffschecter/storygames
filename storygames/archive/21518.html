I am the sort who envisages created characters as a way to understand how rules work, and I was working on what I believed to be a great concept for a ghoul. (Honestly, who doesn't think their own character concepts are great? Possible in spite of all the evidence.)<br/><br/>I notice that the Ghoul skin in MH2 has lost the default Hunger for Flesh option from MH1. It does appear to have the options for being a pirate, however, as one of the suggested hungers is listed as 'plunder' (I may not be entirely serious here).<br/><br/>Now, has the ghoul lost the option for being hungry for flesh for reasons to do with experience of actual play, or is there another reason? My thought is that ghouls and cannibalism go together like chimps and bananas and I'm surprised to see the flesh hunger gone.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470629">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470629/#Comment_470629" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-13T19:16:42+00:00" title="March 13, 2018  7:16PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the author felt it made the Ghoul too rapey, to be blunt; I personally think that was a mistake but it is not my game.

I know that a lot of criticism had been thrown at the skin for the 'time-bomb rapist' potential, but I thought that was to do with the sex move rather than the flesh-eating. I can certainly see how the sex-hunger would be an issue if played by a careless (or possibly immature) player, certainly when combined with Darkest Self.<br/><br/>I'd think that Flesh hunger, though, is more likely to create a serial killer than a rapist. Obviously, neither are great characters to play with in a group, but the Flesh one is possibly more easily dealt with sensibly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470643/#Comment_470643" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-13T22:51:44+00:00" title="March 13, 2018 10:51PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, I wrote Monsterhearts 2. Here's the deal with The Ghoul:<br/><br/>The Ghoul that was written in the first edition had a frequent problem, which is that it was extremely hard to maintain any sort of tempo with regards to intensity. Once you hit the place of lunging at someone with bloodlust in your eyes, that became the new baseline for how frantic, frenzied, and dire the stakes were going to be for your character from that point forward. The hunger for flesh &amp; the rape-y sex move created a scenario where it was hard to play a character who still felt like a high school student by the end of the second act. Deescalation and tonal variation were difficult to achieve.<br/><br/>One of the tools Monsterhearts has for managing de/escalation and tempo is The Darkest Self. If you look at The Ghoul's, you'll notice that every ghoul in the new edition craves flesh and blood. Just not all the time.\n<blockquote>"Your dull hunger sharpens. You can\u2019t focus on anything else but feeding. And in addition to your peculiar cravings, you recognize something else. That primordial hunger which connects all hungers. Flesh, blood, meat. You escape your Darkest Self once you\u2019ve overindulged, or you\u2019ve been locked out for long enough to regain composure"</blockquote>\nThis creates tempo. Maybe you're a thrill-junkie dead boy, like the zombies in "The Zeppo" episode of Buffy. But then when things cross over into really dark territory, something in you snaps: daredevil recklessness isn't enough any more. You want to kill. You want to eat.<br/><br/>But if you want to play a character who's less "disaffected, unhinged, sexy zombie" and more "gnaws on brains between classes zombie," that's cool too! Check out <b>What the Right Hand Wants</b> or talk to the MC about whether they might use <b>Esprit de Corpse</b> to point you in that direction. There are options for playing an all-brains-all-the-time Ghoul if you still want it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470645">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470645/#Comment_470645" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-13T23:09:45+00:00" title="March 13, 2018 11:09PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great answer, Avery.<br/><br/>I've wondered the same thing (how to deal with "pacing" the Ghoul) and this answer settles the question very nicely.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470647">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sadurian" title="Sadurian"><img alt="Sadurian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sadurian">Sadurian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470647/#Comment_470647" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-13T23:18:34+00:00" title="March 13, 2018 11:18PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 13, 2018 11:19PM by Sadurian.">edited March 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's great, thanks for clearing that up. I haven't had the pleasure of playing yet so I can only judge on the Actual Play I've seen and listened to.<br/><br/>I can see how the usual 'hunger' play needs to be toned down in relation to the Darkest Self, and I hadn't noticed that Darkest Self is the switch to full-on 'eat the neighbours' mode. It's a subtle and, at the risk of sounding fawning, a very nice way to model it.<br/><br/>On the same note and whilst I have you here... the two stat-lines for the ghoul model two different aspects of the ghoul concept, but I presume that the game's intention is that these can be altered if required. Instead of [HT-1, CD+2, VT-1, DK+1], for example, I would go for [HT-1, CD+2, VT+1, DK-1].

Naturally, the bullies and power-players see her as a challenge but it is like playing Jenga or Buckaroo, sooner or later one of those snide remarks is going to see her blow.<br/><br/>High COOL is a must for the implacability, but a high VOLATILITY makes the eventual outburst something significant. A VOLATILE-1 means that it is likely that her eruption will see an ineffectual slapping contest ensue rather than the sub-Darkest Self violent outburst I was envisaging.<br/><br/>Obviously it would need passing by any MC and group I eventually get to play with, but having the designer's seal of approval is important to know that I'm not in danger of breaking the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
