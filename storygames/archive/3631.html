"And so it was..." is the phrase used to frame a scene, so the Heart (or Mistaken) framing the scene can actually frame it at the beginning of a conflict in which two characters are involved e.g. two characters are fighting a horde of demons.  In this case, the group now has to figure out how the conflict will work, since the conflict resolution system is designed to be specifically between a single Heart and their Mistaken.  It then gets complicated because, as Ben pointed out, a Heart always has control over their character's actions.  So you now have the Primary Heart (Heart1) in the main conflict with the Mistaken, fighting alongside the Secondary Heart (Heart2), who controls the actions of that character.  There are many ways to deal with this: switching viewpoints, as mentioned above, is one way, Heart2 having veto power over any action that is narrated regarding their character is another.  What if it's two characters fighting each other?  Then you have the Mistaken as well as Heart2 providing an opposing force to Heart1: a completely different situation than the previous example!<br/><br/>There are too many cases, too many possibilities to put down in rules.  Polaris is a story about these Knights' tragic ends and the rules presented support that incredibly well.  The reason this scene-framing technique is described as advanced is because it should really only be attempted after the people involved have played the game several times and have a good, intuitive sense of the flow of the game.  It's for people who are comfortable breaking outside the established structure of the game (where the Hearts don't interact and do not even be of the same generation).  There is no "right way" to run conflicts with multiple Hearts involved, so there are no rules for it.<br/><br/>hth,<br/><br/>Nancy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_81857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ronaldo" title="Ronaldo"><img alt="Ronaldo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ronaldo">Ronaldo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81857/#Comment_81857" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-17T17:11:40+00:00" title="July 17, 2007  5:11PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you, you were very kind in taking the time to answer my question. It helps a lot.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Faerieloch</cite>. There is no "right way" to run conflicts with multiple Hearts involved, so there are no rules for it.</blockquote>\nNow, this I believe and it explains why I couldn't get my answer before. The game is not designed to handle multiple protagonists in the same conflict and if you absolutely need, you have to find a way to deal with it. I suspected that. I can see how this could easily get touchy.<br/><br/><br/>The way I envisioned it was:<br/><br/>1) 2 hearts on the same side -<br/><br/>If heart 2 is a moon, it could possibly act as a  primary character as well. The rules would be bent, no question. Mistaken 1 would pose opposition to heart 1 and heart 2. A conflict could go like: mistaken 1 - heart 1 - mistaken 1 - heart 2 and so on. The other moon would be the sole referee.<br/><br/>If heart 2 is the mistaken then the rules could be bent by handlng the mistaken/opposition role to one of the moons and doing the same as above.<br/><br/>This gets worse if more protagonists get involved.<br/><br/>2) 2 opposing hearts - <br/><br/>If heart 2 is the mistaken, then it could be easy.<br/><br/>If heart 2 is the moon, then the moon and mistaken would work together, as you mentioned above (this shouldn't bend the rules).<br/><br/>3) The only way I envision it without changing the rules is:<br/><br/>Heart 2 stays secondary and after heart 1 or mistaken 1 end the conflict then, if heart 2 wants, it can pick it up during the next scene from where it was left and mistaken 2 takes the guidance of the opposition with heart 1 staying secondary. Heart 1 could conceivably pick it up afterwards.<br/><br/><br/>The heart of the problem is that the system is not designed to handle multiple protagonists in a conflict. I see this as a minor weakness and was hoping that during playtesting intelligent solutions had come up and these could have been placed in the same chapter that talks about the 3 and 5-player games. Multiple protagonists in a conflict could be done but it puts a hard strain on the system. In a sense, many times, you will have to come up with house rules. I was wondering if in your experience  you found ways to handle these that were better than others.<br/><br/>Thank you very much again for your answer and your courage.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81860/#Comment_81860" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-17T17:30:10+00:00" title="July 17, 2007  5:30PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ronaldo</cite>The heart of the problem is that the system is not designed to handle multiple protagonists in a conflict.

Not every game needs a convenient way for two protagonists to mess with one another just like not every system needs rules for drowning and falling.<br/><br/>I will say that I might have reacted similarly to you (albeit less strongly) if I asked Ben the question you did and he gave me that answer.  That said, after having played Polaris (in fact, playing it with Faerieloch where both of our protagonists where in my scene), Ben's answer made 100% sense.  But just as it's unfair to demand your math teacher teach you Calculus after you spent a bit of time reading an Algebra book without trying to work an algebra problem, it's unfair to ask Ben to explain some "advanced" portions of his game and <i>demand</i> that explanation be talked down to someone who hasn't taken the time to gain actual play experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_81864">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ronaldo" title="Ronaldo"><img alt="Ronaldo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ronaldo">Ronaldo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81864/#Comment_81864" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-17T17:51:39+00:00" title="July 17, 2007  5:51PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            His answer was very disrespectful on what was a fairly respectful interaction up to that point. <br/><br/>I asked an open and general question and anybody could take a stab at it. TJ tried, he used the book but the bottomline is that this is not explained in the book, period. Then you have to either  come up with an answer by yourself or to find a more experienced player who could possibly give you some pointers.<br/><br/>Mr. Lehman came to the discussion with absolutely nothing to add. And, posted in a way that, TO ME, sounded like he wanted that to be it. No answer, no discussion, no conclusion. <br/><br/>I highly agree with you that not every game needs to handle one protagonist to mess with one another. This can be more of a problem in some GMless-like games. As you say, this could very well have been his intention. But, a couple of things bother me. Instead of just saying that this is not his intention and to the extent of his advice, it shouldn't be done. In his book, he says otherwise. IMO, he made a very poor choice of not recognizing the limitation (or if you prefer "uniqueness", I prefer "weakness") and not providing the option in the book or elsewhere. If there was a way to do this, I would have a better impression of this game as this is a difficult trick to pull off.<br/><br/>I took my time to buy the game, to read the book a couple of times. My question was fair and pertinent. I was hoping somebody was going to give some pointers like Nancy did. I don't care if mr. Lehman answers it or not. I don't accept him treating me like an idiot. He will need to be more respectful as I was until that point.<br/><br/> I am trying to accept and/or patch my perceived holes as I prepare to present this game in group play the most palatable way I can.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81867/#Comment_81867" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-17T18:12:29+00:00" title="July 17, 2007  6:12PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 17, 2007 6:12PM by Ryan_Macklin.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ronaldo</cite>I took my time to buy the game, to read the book a couple of times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>He will need to be more respectful as I was until that point.</blockquote>\n"He <em>will need</em>"?<br/><br/>Uh, woah there.

However it doesn't clarify the issue in any positive light: if people feel people <em>need</em> to treat you with respect, then you should also feel that you need to treat others with respect.

If you don't, then you're just a jerk.  (As an aside: I also don't buy into the "People need to treat me with respect" idea -- I do buy into the "I'd like it if people did and would like to encourage them to go so" idea, though.)<br/><br/>To get back on topic: in the game I mentioned above, while Nancy's Heart was in my story for some scenes (as we shared an NPC -- my sister &amp; her lover), we didn't actually really get into a conflict between us.  I think your best bet would be to <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=polaris+actual+play" rel="nofollow">Google for "Polaris actual play"</a> if you haven't already done that to see what people have actually done with the game.  That may better illustrate answers to your Polaris questions in general, now that you've got something from Nancy's reply.<br/><br/>Edit: to reply to your most recent post, honestly, the parts I quoted were the only parts I cared to respond to because that's what I felt most strongly about.

Even though they don't seem to care much to share. And, it is ok. I should just sheepishly put my head down and follow the flock as mr. Lehman's and others have suggested multiple times. Once or twice here but more elsewhere.<br/><br/>You can have great insights about games from reading reviews, APs, message boards, etc... We have been doing this for years. <br/><br/>The answer to my question is crystal clear in my mind. The reason why the answer had this veil of mystery around it is also absolutely clear. <br/><br/>Even though it seems like there is an interest in making it more than this, Polaris is a nice little game with some neat aspects and some minor weaknesses.

The reality is, I am not. <br/><br/>I came here with a single, simple question that initially was: how to handle multiple characters involved in a conflict (Polaris wise)? Since the book is rather vague regarding this issue and the author who voluntarily came here and insisted in keeping the vagueness while pretending to be actually giving an answer, then it became clear that my question is: how can you make advanced use of the "phrase" "and so it was" to handle conflicts involving multiple characters? <br/><br/>Otherwise, my behavior has been most of the times reactive.<br/><br/>People like yourself told me he had answered the question and I answered why not.

So, benefit of the doubt here.<br/><br/>1) As I said in my first post. Quickly switching the point of View between the characters. Think of it like they are in a novel and each chapter has a different character as the protagonist with he other his antagonist or foil. The author likes both character so he doesn't have one screw with the other too badly. "And so it was" is the start of each new short chapter. The respective Mistaken for those Hearts made good use of blindsiding the Hearts with demons to distract them from each other (Your demon lover has returned from the Mistake!!). Lovely tragedy from that but I can see that being terrible advice if you were not in the middle of a pitched battle for a Remnant at the time or if everyone wants to see the characters just throw down.<br/><br/>2) The author did say in the book on page 64.<br/><br/>3/4) Also on page 64 the author let you know he didn't want to discuss. It was certainly worth your effort to ask about it though and see what he and others had to say.<br/>This comes down to the fact Ben thinks the best way to handle this is to have you play the game and come to those decisions on your own rather then have trouble with "dangerous" advice. I believe Ben made it clear as to what he considered what appropriate questions were between the book and here. No need at all to ask what can or cannot be talked about. Talk about it and people will let you know.<br/><br/>4) That not a valid observation. See response 3/4.<br/><br/><br/>Previous post:<br/>To me Ben's message was clear, it just wasn't the answer you were looking for. Reminds me of when I was trying to learn digital art. Most of the advice was go and paint then it would make sense to you and that got to me too. But after screwing up several tutorials without getting much better I can see the wisdom to that advice better.<br/>Still I'm glad to see that Ben has like many of the artists I tried to learn from have gone the extra step of saying he is available to look at the mistakes that can come from that and help you at that point.<br/>The only protection of the status quo here is letting the author decide how he treats his game and the people he talks to. <br/>I let him do what he think is best when he is in a thread about his game and try to follow his lead.<br/>Backing each other in how we want to make and work with our games is part of being indie to me.<br/>The afore mentioned artists also created a environment that seemed hostile and unhelpful until you looked at it form there perspective. That perspective was they didn't own anyone a damn thing and they were going out of there way to be helpful to you. But they were glad to help and very helpful indeed when you put the effort into meeting their standards for work required.<br/><br/>I tried to keep insults and snark from this but I've truthfully been in an insulting mood these last few weeks so I've added this last 2 sentences.

I find <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> to be interesting. I own polaris and have read it, but have not played it yet. So I can contribute nothing in the way of AP. <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> and <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> do not interest me in the slightest. I don't care if Ben hints at advanced phrases or special goggles or secret sex acts performed under the light of the new moon. I don't feel insulted if Ben feels that we should all stick with the game's primary focus until we can safely handle master level mojo. The game is impressive in its design and conceptualization. Its imagery is hauntingly beautiful. That's enough for me.<br/><br/>As for <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a>. Actually my response wasn't about that at all. I don't think I have any say in what you know or are allowed to know. I was just commenting on the sarcastic and angry tone that has entered the thread. I think that is ultimately why the many points that you find interesting are being ignored. Most everyone is reacting to the anger and ignoring the initial questions. As patronizing and frustrating as you found Ben's initial responses to your question, his language was at least always polite and respectful. It looks to me like he did start trying to address your question before things turned snarky. I just don't think he understood your focus on some "advanced use of the phrase."<br/><br/>And just to pick a nit: The text does not say "advanced use of the "And so it was" phrase" it says "judicious use" of the phrase. The words "advanced technique" in the text...I need some quibling language here...seem to...refer back to having two protagonists in the same conflict as opposed to "basic conflict methods." There's no description of the special advanced use of the phrase, cuz there never was any special advanced use, just careful use. And now we're back to Hearts with veto power over their protagonists, or switching POVs or other techniques.

Why mention that this exist if it is unavailable to the players? If he doesn't want to talk about it? Why? It sounds to me as if he was aware his game was weak on that but he did not want to admit it. I think, it would have been a lot more genuine and helpful if he had stopped at the pointers he gave in the book and that he repeated here without mentioning this which, in reality, effectively doesn't exist.<br/><br/>3/4) If he didn't want to discuss then or here or ever, it would have been a lot more helpful not to mention it at all. It gives us the impression that something actually exists when in fact it doesn't, it is meaningless. I will be glad (if I can still find the book) to find solutions on my own. His message was conflicting in the book and I would rather learn benefiting from an existing rule and/or somebody's previous experience then to start from the scratch. <br/><br/>3/4) There are forbidden themes here people admitting it or not. And, if you hang around enough you can slowly figure out what is part of the don't ask/don't tell.<br/><br/>This is not a craft and it is tough to demand that everybody who wants some specific information or to expand on a game would have to play and be experienced in that specific game before being able to access the desired information. We have lives and we want to make the best use of our free time. Information is our best ally.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: tj333</cite> I tried to keep insults and snark from this but I've truthfully been in an insulting mood these last few weeks so I've added this last 2 sentences.

I don't.  Imagine if I'd bought a car from you.  "Oh boy I've got a car I'm so excited!" I say, "I've heard about doing this thing called a 'drift turn' and I'm so excited about it!  Teach me how to do a drift turn!"<br/><br/>You might say something like: "Okay, so have you learned how to drive yet?"<br/><br/>And I might reply: "No, I don't know how to drive, I just want to do drift turns."<br/><br/>Do you see how it might be problematic to teach me how to do a drift turn if I've never driven a car before in my life?  Do you see how you, as the car-company, might not even be able to teach me how to do a drift turn?<br/><br/>It is similar with Polaris and advanced techniques.  There are lots of advanced techniques scattered throughout the book, of which this is one.  None of these are new rules, like you propose with your "two players giving a response to one Mistaken" house rule.  They are all (with one exception, this isn't it) simply applications of the existing rules.  None of these are going to make much sense at all until you've played the game for at least a few scenes, just like a drift turn doesn't make a lot of sense unless you've driven a car at least a few times.<br/><br/>Including the PS, all the rules that you need to have multiple protagonists in action at once are rules from the book that I've posted in this thread.  I can walk you step by step through putting them together, but I'm not going to tell you outright.

I was playing Polaris all night last night and a sticky situation came up. <br/><br/>1) Sir Ursa Major (Heart's heart) and Ursa Minor (New Moon's heart) who became rivals during the game entered in a conflict. They are both in love with D'Alva whom had been possessed by a demon. In general, they were both working together to get rid of the demon while while "playing" against each other to try to be or seem the main responsible for doing so. So, the way it played out was that Ursa Minor stayed secondary until Ursa Major's scene ended and then played a scene just after that and continued the fight. The demon was defeated and Ursa Minor took the credit. It felt quite artificial and it never felt like both knights were playing together together to get rid of the demon or that they were trying to edge each other for the credit of doing so.<br/><br/>2) Later on Sir Ursa Major was again the heart and feeling short changed in that prior conflict, he challenged Ursa Minor (who was going to marry D'Alva) in a duel. This was easier since the New Moon and the Mistaken worked together on Minor's action. Is this a good way of doing it?<br/><br/>3) Close to the end of our session, Ursa major (Heart's heart) and Cassiopea (Mistaken's heart) were working together to convince the senators that a threat coming from the South was real and to support a short campaign to investigate and eliminate the threat. In this case, the mistaken guided the opposition and guided his heart as a secondary character. It was ok, if not awkward. The mistaken's heart never became a real factor in the conflict. Neither for the drama (which was unfortunate) nor for the heated debate. Should we have handled the opposition's guidance to one of the moons? I have the impression that if the 2 protagonists had the opportunity to be more active together it would have been a much more exciting scene. Can it be done?<br/><br/>4) We were planning a scene for Ursa Major (Heart's heart) where he and Cassiopea (mistaken's heart) were going against some "forces" of the South but at that point we were not sure because we really wanted both to work together and after the senators's debate we were not sure how to handle the guidance of the scene. So, we called it a night and I told my friends that I would ask here. I knew I could get some help in these difficult situations.<br/><br/>We shall see what comes of it.<br/><br/>Thank you so much in advance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_81957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ronaldo" title="Ronaldo"><img alt="Ronaldo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ronaldo">Ronaldo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81957/#Comment_81957" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-18T05:42:05+00:00" title="July 18, 2007  5:42AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite>PS "And so it was" begins and ends scenes.</blockquote>\nThank you for the reminder!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ronaldo" title="Ronaldo"><img alt="Ronaldo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ronaldo">Ronaldo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81962/#Comment_81962" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-18T06:16:00+00:00" title="July 18, 2007  6:16AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite>No need.

rules and it effectively uses "and so it was" in a slightly different way. At least I have a frame work of where to start when it comes down to multiple-protagonist conflicts:<br/><br/>The key is to continue to play the conflict over multiple scenes. Since the position of heart/primary protagonist will be changing with each scene, the mistaken will also be changing and the same opposition could be handled by a different mistaken from scene to scene. The conflict is "the same" but the focus may change dramatically as different protagonists become hearts. So, each has plenty of opportunity to contribute. When the heart or the mistaken had enough of a specific scene they say "and so it was" and another heart and mistaken take over.<br/><br/>The only thing I am not sure is when to finish the conflict.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_82414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82414/#Comment_82414" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-19T23:29:01+00:00" title="July 19, 2007 11:29PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm trying to wrap my head around the question. The problem is if there is no conflict between primary heart and mistaken then they can say "and that was how it happened" and end the scene.

But, I think there are ways to deal with it. Conceptually, the before a player(1) says "and that was how it happened" he could ask around if some other player(2) would have something else to say/do and say "and so it was instead". Even if a player says  "and that was how it happened", nothing prevents the next player (who is not yet satisfied) from continuing the "conflict" from the point it was left. I prefer the asking around though.<br/><br/>It could go something like this. To make it easy, I will place 2 protagonists against a demon. Player 1, Player 2, Player 3 (plays mistaken for player 1) and Player 4 (plays mistaken for player 2).<br/><br/>Ursa Major (player 1) and Ursa Minor (player 2) go on to take a demon. <br/><br/>Ursa Major (heart) - I invade the house and use my sword to make the demon get away from D'Alva.<br/>Mistaken 3 - but only if she is unconscious and you don't know if she is alive.<br/>Ursa Major - And so it was.<br/>Ursa Minor - I am furious that she could be dead and I destroy the demon.<br/>Mistaken 4 - you ask far too much.<br/>Ursa Minor - Ursa Major tells me that she will be ok (player 1 nods positively) and I follow the demon.<br/>Mistaken 4 - but only if  he has D'aAlva's younger sister.<br/>Ursa Minor - and furthermore, I attack him and he escapes but the little girl is safe.<br/>Mistaken 4 - this shall not come to pass.<br/>Die is rolled...<br/><br/>What do you think?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_82613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82613/#Comment_82613" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-22T15:27:16+00:00" title="July 22, 2007  3:27PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First: slight typo I think on third line.

Its a bit of a clunky example, but here:<br/><br/>Heart1 - <b>And so it was</b> that Ursa Major invaded the house and used her sword to drive the demon from Lady D'Alva's side<br/>Mistaken1 - <b>But only if</b> she is unconscious and you don't know if she is alive...<br/>Heart2 - Wait! I wanted Ursa Minor to rush into the house in front of Ursa Major and kill the demon before she gets there. <br/><br/>So, now there are three conflicts I can see. Ursa Major v. demon, Ursa Minor v. demon, and Ursa Major v. Ursa Minor<br/>What phrase would begin the conflict between Ursas Major and Minor? <br/><br/>The above example still works if Heart2 speaks before Mistaken1's "but only if..." Heart1 made a statement (I rush into the house). Does Heart2 get to reject it?

It is doable but will have a tendency to be clunky and require some compromise by the participants. This is where input from people that have done it before would be so valuable. You, for sure, are an experienced player and I have played for 15 years myself. By reading the book we can easily come up with situations where the system, as written, wouldn't work. We can come up with house rules too but only time would optimize them but I believe this may be finite as well. If not, it is still harder reinvent the wheel.<br/><br/>PTA would make life easier in this situation. <br/>Stakes for player 1 - kill the demon before 2 and save Dalvas life.<br/>player 2 - kill the demon before 1 and save the sisters life.<br/><br/>Possible results:<br/>win-win - both sisters alive and demon dead. Higher success gets credit for the kill.<br/>win-lose - 1 kills the demon, D'Alva is alive and sister is dead.<br/>lose-win -  3 kills the demon, D'Alva is dead and sister is alive.<br/>lose-lose - Demon escapes and kills both sisters.<br/><br/>At this point, it feels better to just accept this limitation of the system and not allow multiple protagonists in a conflict. sure, multiple can be there but only one will be primary and the other ones will have a well-defined secondary role.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_82628">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82628/#Comment_82628" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-23T00:40:11+00:00" title="July 23, 2007 12:40AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My bad.

I wish one of two things had been done: either, don't mention that was a way to deal with multiple protagonists at all or be straight up that it is not in the design of the game. I don't like the way it was done in the book. I like the way they did with Universalis a lot better. They use the optional rules mechanism to create a patch to allow people to use PCs. So ,it is not the intent of the game but the author makes the option available to people who want to try. A much more sincere and helpful presentation. Had him not have mentioned at all about the PCs, I would be ok with it b/c it is clearly out of the scope of the game. Had him sad that it was possible through the optional rules and left it at that, I would not have enjoyed it. <br/><br/>What I said in the post I complained about Ben's answer was motivated <b>not only </b>by that answer per se but also about a pattern of behavior that is not exclusive to him that has soured me for Story-Games/Indie Games. I am much less inclined to buy these games and introduce new people. this surely doesn't mean anything to the community but if I don't silent, when other people possibly voice similar feelings in the future it could carry an additive effect, so I rather speak up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_83381">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83381/#Comment_83381" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-25T18:59:08+00:00" title="July 25, 2007  6:59PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're of course entitled to that opinion. And maybe it would have been better not to mention it, but some folks have done the multiple character thing and seem to like it fine. So, I'm okay with the hint in the text and letting people stumble around if they want to "go where no one has gone before." <br/><br/>The risk is that for some people that first game experience, at a con or at a friend's house, may be the only chance a game gets to make a sale. It would be unfortunate if a bunch of stupid-GM-tricks (yeah I know, there's no GM in Polaris) were responsible for turning off a group of gamers from what I think is an amazing game (admittedly, only from reading and listening to AP podcasts), even more so if they then went out and spread word of their bad experience. So, I understand the desire for players to play what ya wrote.<br/><br/>Another thought I had. I think being the Heart can be awesome, and it might be awesome to be another Heart in full conflict (like a starlight sword duel), but it would seem to be complete suckage to play a sidekick in someone else's scene.

But, the people at the table and I would rather decide for ourselves instead of having someone else make the decision for us. We don't need a parent. We like options. We like to have the resources available to decide to use them or not if we feel the need.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_85512">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ronaldo" title="Ronaldo"><img alt="Ronaldo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ronaldo">Ronaldo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85512/#Comment_85512" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-04T07:20:33+00:00" title="August  4, 2007  7:20AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gaming is a very professional market today. It is very difficult to compete if you want to be amateur in your behavior. <br/><br/>Unhappily, in the world today, each one of us has the power to make our own choices. You choose to exclude me (and alienate several potential players) and I choose not to buy certain line of products any more.<br/><br/>At CompUSA, the Apple guy gave my dad some info about a MAC and, later on, the managers said they were inaccurate and basically said: "I am the manager and here things are the way I say they are, no matter what other professionals in the store said". The conflict was simply settled with us saying: "this is ok, but, the money is ours and we are not going to buy it". And, all the parts were happily ever after.<br/><br/>My brother won the MTV Music Video of the Year in Brazil (the prestigious VMB) and more than a dozen other prizes. But, he can't capitalize much on it. He is an artist and wants to stay true to himself instead of being flexible and responding to the needs of the people who could hire him but instead use their money to hire somebody else, usually, less talented.<br/><br/>Before Polaris I bought: Seven Leagues, PrimeTime Adventures, Trollbabe and Universalis. Polaris was the fifth book. <br/>I was interested in buying: Grey Ranks, Best Friends, The Mountain Witch, Super Leagues and Sorcerer.<br/>I had introduced friends (including in Brazil) to PTA and 7L.<br/>I had one question that were nicely answered on: 7L, PTA and TB.<br/>No questions on Universalis due to the masterfully written rules. Also, many questions are already answered by a beautiful internet support.<br/><br/>After my Polaris was "given away",I have not introduced anybody else to progressive games. I am back to having 4 progressive games. I have not bought any more of these games while I spent about 200 gaming dollars elsewhere during the same period.<br/><br/>You choose, I choose.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/3631/polaris-multiple-protagonists-in-a-conflict" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/3631/polaris-multiple-protagonists-in-a-conflict" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/3631/polaris-multiple-protagonists-in-a-conflict/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F3631%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F3631%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
