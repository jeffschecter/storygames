She's finishing up a 6 page debrief right now.<br/><br/>A situation I found myself in repeatedly is that a table would open up and 6 players would want to play. Half would only want to play Marvel, the other half were interested in games like Dungeon World, Apocalypse World, Dogs in the Vineyard but were flexible. So on Friday and Saturday I ended up running a lot of Marvel. <br/><br/>There were also a lot of Fiasco games but it wasn't uncommon for a single facilitator to setup 2 games at the same time! Which is part of the magic of Fiasco. Fiasco also require minimal materials where with Marvel I had to run to make copies of characters and buy more dice to keep up with the demand. I also spent time jumping from table to table answering Marvel rules questions while I was GMing other tables. <br/><br/>On Sunday we took Marvel off the table as an option but then we ran into a very weird situation. 3-4 groups of people came up to us around 1-2pm, asked to play Marvel, and then were upset that it wasn't available. 2 groups told us they were scheduled to play Marvel at that time and had tables reserved (I have no idea what they were talking about) and several other people told us that they were promised that after they bought the game we would be the ones to teach them how to play (again, no idea what they were talking about). We had to turn some of them away unfortunately as there were also other people who wanted to play the games that were currently available. <br/><br/>I also know that on Saturday, when we had 9 tables filled, that there were even more people who wanted to play. But I don't know what games they wanted. We were also incredibly lucky as we didn't have the GMs to keep up with this demand but people who played in earlier games stepped up to help us!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_372193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372193/#Comment_372193" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-10T14:17:31+00:00" title="April 10, 2012  2:17PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Where did the huge push for Fiasco come from?

It's a heavily prep- and materials-intensive game, so our ability to offer it was much more limited, and as folks said, it was already on offer elsewhere. I did manage to have a big pile of materials ready to go that I left behind to get that Sunday 3:16 off with a bang. But a lot of the Indie stuff does actually require materials be ready to go.<br/><br/>Another aspect of Fiasco's success is Wil Wheaton's regular and vocal championing of the game.<br/><br/>Communication of available resources is clearly something we need to get better at: I had a big binder full of stuff that would have let you run AW or DW, Will, but I obviously didn't do a good job of letting everyone know what it was and that it was available, sorry.<br/><br/>For my part, I may be in the minority, but I really LIKE running full-length sessions when I get a table that's down for it. AW in particular doesn't really start to sing until about 2 hours into a first session; you can pare it down and use pre-gens, but doing PCs and Hx is the thing that really makes that game shine, so I was grateful for the opportunity to get a few longer sessions in, including a 4.5 hour Marvel game that turned out to be one of the high points of the show for me.<br/><br/>Another thing to keep in mind re: Marvel was that to most of the crowd there, it was BRAND new. We've been talking it up here for months, and playtesting and doing pre-release parties and etc, so it gets easy to forget that it only hit game stores middle of last week, so it was no kidding the 'New Hotness' for most of the fans there. I expect that even if we offered it next year, it would be a known quantity and not get nearly the play it did this year as a completely new thing. EDIT: To add that of the 3 games of it I ran no one had yet seen the book. According to that crew from the long game I ran, "Dude, you just sold 4 copies of this!" (the 5th had bought it in the hall on the way to the game and wanted to play it before he read it...)<br/><br/>For at least this year, we're going to stick to much stricter organized time slots for Origins like last year, and see how that goes. One of the real challenges was having NO particular start times for games... I'd really prefer to see us start games every hour on the hour and not be afraid to tell people to come back; I think we'd have a lot better luck with matchmaking and time management that way. I get not wanting to 'turn people away', but this is a show where people will wait in a line so that they can get into a line that they then wait in for 2 hours to play 3 minutes of a video game. Having them come back in 20 minutes so we can make sure they've got a full table and options for several games seems like it'd be worth the occasional disappointed patron that they couldn't jump in NOW. <br/><br/>Thanks for putting this together guys.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
