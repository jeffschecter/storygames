                    So here's what I'm thinking about, and it's going to creep its way into my conversations at DexCon.  Heads up, I guess!<br/>
<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">
<div class="QuoteText">When you play D&amp;D (for instance) you want your group to eventually confront the Big Bad and defeat them ... which is why you have a vast complex of rules which <i>prevent</i> you from simply saying "Okay, we go out and defeat the Big Bad.  What's next?" before you've earned it.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, this is often stated in a very simplistic PCs-vs.-GM opposition:  the rules give the GM the power to rein the PCs in ... because those pesky players can't be trusted to understand the importance of not just jumping to the end.  It'd be neat to make a system where what you conflicted over was not "Do we get closer to defeating the bad guy or get stalled in a fun way?" but rather "Who gets to decide how we get stalled this time?"  Like, if the GM wins the conflict then the bad-guy escapes because you guys are too weak to chase him down, but if you win then the bad-guy escapes because people were in danger and you <b>chose</b> to let him go in order to save them.<br/>
<br/>
You could still have progress in a stalling-based system, but the progress toward the goal would <b>always</b> have to be at a disadvantage for the person who chose it.  So, to get into the black castle you can't win a conflict and sneak in ... but you can win a conflict, be captured, and be thrown into the dungeons of the black castle.  You're in, but disadvantage to you.<br/>
<br/>
To apply it to my current game project: when you tell a story of teen romance, you want your characters to eventually reveal their real feelings, make themselves vulnerable and grow to understand others.  But, to simplify that down:  you want the boy and the girl to kiss.  So what those two players are contesting over isn't "Do we kiss or not?" it's "Okay ... who gets to be the one who makes up the excuse for us not to kiss?"</div>

                            The answer to the first part of your thinking is Bringing Down the Pain in TSOY.  The player tells the GM by bringing down the pain "This is interesting to me and I want to get into the meat of the blow-by-blow", whereas otherwise you roll, succeed, and say "Yeah I killed him. Next".<br>
<br>
The last part of your thought, though, is interesting, and something else...                        </br></br></div>

                            That's actually how I intended to handle sports games, albeit a little flipped.<br><br>Figure every sports story ends the same way: the underdogs pull it out in the end.  So while these stories are theoretically about the game being played, they're really about the various characters in play and the little dramas that surround them.  The model then would be all about deferring the game until the players have all their pieces (which is to say) plot threads in order.  Perhaps the players have the option of accepting complications to further defer the big game.<br><br>-Rob D.<br><br>PS - This is also the way iId probably do Voltron, if I were ever so inclined. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

Absolutely.  What's your excuse for not pulling out that gigantic flaming sword as your <i>very first move of the battle</i>?                        </div>

                            I don't talk at Cons. I just play Jungle Speed.<br/><br/>I liked how Scarlet Wake took the traditional "progress until big boss fight" and made it interesting by mechanically making it so that you <i>will</i> lose the first fight, putting you in a "Bind," but giving you the currency to increase your effectiveness in the next fight. Every so often, depending on the pre-game boss generation, there would be a break point where you would lose again. Rinse &amp; repeat until you finally make it out the other side. Very much a "its not the destination but the path" hard-coded into the sytem.                        </div>
