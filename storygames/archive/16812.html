They have a number of actions dependent on the dice pool for the scene (similar to Wushu). Every action involves a trait (rated d4-d12). After all of the dice are gathered, the players divide them into relevant actions based on their descriptions (Action, Reaction, Recovery, Support). Every die that rolls 5 or more (d4's must roll 4 twice) equals a success.<br/><br/>Example. Sorry for the embellishment, couldn't help myself.\n<blockquote><b>Dramatis Personae</b><br/>Rohan has a Battle skill at d8, Move at d6, Treatment d6 and a single Wound.<br/><br/>The Dragon Lord has a Battle skill of d6, Armor at d8 and Hellfire at d8.<br/><br/><b>The situation</b><br/>The Dragon Lord is standing across a chasm from Rohan. Behind him is a castle where Rohan's goal lies (captured princess, magic weapon, whatever). Hellfire from the Dragon Lord is burning the forests on both sides of the chasm, raining ash into the chasm and the river below.<br/><br/><b>Description</b><br/>Scene dice pool = 3<br/>Rohan stabs his sword into the ground and rips a piece of his sleeve to tie around his wound, staunching it (Treatment d6 - Recovery). The Dragon Lord charges his hands with Hellfire and unleashes it across the chasm at Rohan (Hellfire d8 - Action). Rohan retrieves his sword, side steps and launches himself across the chasm in a mighty leap (Move d6 - Reaction). The Dragon Lord's eyes widen in surprise has his opponent leaps over the fire. He tries to turn aside, sidestepping the incoming blow (Battle d6 - Reaction). Rohan comes down, blade first, with the momentum from his leap behind his powerful swing (Battle d8 - Action). The Dragon Lord relies on his armor to take the brunt of the force, and it bites down into his should pads (Armor d8).<br/><br/><b>Resolution</b><br/>Trait (Result)<br/><i>Rohan:</i> Action - Battle d8 (Fail), Reaction - Move d6 (Success), Recovery - Treatment d6 (Success)<br/><i>Dragon Lord:</i> Action - Hellfire d8 (Success), Reaction - Battle d6 and Armor d8 (2 Failures)<br/><br/>Result - Rohan heals a wound. Niether manages to hit their opponent (Rohan failed his attack, but made his Reaction).</blockquote>\nI made all of that up as I wrote the post. Nothing felt off, which is cool. I might change armor and weapons to just be add-on dice that work beyond a scene dice pool. Not sure how that would balance with things like the Hellfire above, which works as a skill rather than a modifier (thus, not possessing a modifier and potentially unbalanced/gimped against weaponry).<br/><br/>What do you guys think?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383675/#Comment_383675" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-27T20:21:37+00:00" title="June 27, 2012  8:21PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Here's the basic mechanic, meant for a generic, non-setting specific system.</blockquote>\nThis may be a problem.

Who's your intended audience?<br/>It's pretty hard to evaluate a mechanical bit in a vacuum.</blockquote>\nThanks for the info.<br/><br/><i>What do I want to accomplish?</i><br/>A generic system that can apply to most/any settings and genres.<br/><br/><i>What do you want to highlight that others don't already do?</i><br/>I'd like to highlight the narrative, while not sacrificing all vestiges of crunch. Most systems focus one way or the other (narrative or crunch) and few of the narrative systems have decent advancement mechanics that can keep a prolonged campaign running (I intend to do something like WoD, where you spend points on individual traits for advancement).<br/><br/><i>Who's your intended audience?</i><br/>I know the downfall of saying "everybody", and that's not my intention. I want to focus on newcomers to the RPG world, but give enough of a crunch for experienced players to enjoy it as well. I'll be throwing it up on the typical venues for purchasing RPGs (RPGNow, DriveThru, etc.) but it will be most marketed in the same venues where I host my fictional works, as those are the settings that I'm bringing to life through the RPG and the fans of those are the ones I intend to market towards, which will likely be new players.<br/><br/>That was kind of convoluted. Short answer: a gateway game for a new audience, but with some crunch to keep diehard gamers entertained.<br/><br/>Does that help? Any advice on where I should retool those goals?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383703/#Comment_383703" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-28T03:19:41+00:00" title="June 28, 2012  3:19AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have a number of questions and suggestions, I'll just go one by one. I suspect this might be harsh. There's no need to answer these questions here, they're just stuff to think about.<br/><br/>1. I notice there's a huge drop in the chance of success between the d6 and d4 (like, from 33,3% to 6% or something). Is d4 supposed to be an "untrained" level? Rolling it twice seems a bit jarring, and might be confusing for new players. <br/><br/>2. I was a bit confused about what the actual procedure was. Do we pick which traits we will be rolling before the scene starts? Do we roll them all together or as each individual action happens or at the end after all descriptions are in place? There are a few other questions...who goes first? Who sets the dice pool size? If this is a trait-picking game, what prevents me from going for my highest traits every time?<br/><br/>3. I think it would be fair to say that your target audience is roughly the same as "the people who read your books and have (possibly) never played before". That seems to me like a pretty good target (it might not be! it's up to you). In this case, what are some qualities that your protagonists have? What do they care about? What are your books about (what kind of picture do they paint about the world/your world)? Ask yourself these kinds of questions and let them guide you as you're creating the mechanics. What makes this a better system to play your books in, compared to, say, FATE, PDQ#, Savage Worlds or Wushu?<br/><br/>4. Writing examples of how play is supposed to go is a good exercise, but ultimately there's a difference between how you want/expect it to be and how it really plays. Get a rough draft together, grab a friend or stranger and test it out. See where it feels right or wrong. Look for where the system is acting against you and where it's helping you in achieving your ideal play experience (for this particular game).<br/><br/>5. Finally, the fiction in the play example seems cool (mighty leaps! blazing dragonfire!) but I don't see anything that prompts us to such description. (to paraphrase a bit, one of the possible purposes of rules in a game is that they make us say interesting things - in your example that seems all on the players) The resolution feels more like we're rolling dice at each other and there's a pass/fail result (which relates to what - the character's action or their intent?). There's also no visible link between what Rohan is trying to do in the scene (get to the castle) and how what he's doing/rolling connects to that. Finally, what would happen if the hellfire attack had been successful? Would that deal damage? Impose a negative trait?<br/><br/>Like Rafu said, this is all a bit in a vacuum.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383705/#Comment_383705" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-28T04:47:51+00:00" title="June 28, 2012  4:47AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Any advice on where I should retool those goals?</blockquote>\nWell, in answering the third question, you seem to state your goal pretty clearly: You want to bring your fictional settings to life through an rpg. Right? You want to offer your readers the chance to roleplay your fiction?<br/><br/>So you actually don't want a "generic" system, which doesn't exist anyway. All games have a point of view. You're gonna be better off with one that matches your fiction.<br/><br/>So, what's your fiction like? Is it like the example of play above? Fantasy dudes fighting each other? A sense of dramatic, interpersonal conflict and tactical decision-making?

That's why I think and RPG would be good for my settings, since what I write tends to flow nicely between transition and action (physical action), in the way that most RPGs play out, which is where I learned the form <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>.<br/><br/>The only reason I didn't just go with the open licenses from Fate or Wushu (both very high on my list) is because they have no character progression. One of the primary things about my fiction is that the characters always change and grow, usually in a very profound way, that would be simulated well with an advancement system. The best advancement system I can think of that would mimic this style is the Storyteller system, where they spend points somewhat freeform to raise specific character traits, rather than D&amp;D style where everything raises equally.<br/><br/>I'd like this game to flow (both mechanically and narratively) through two types of scenes - transition and action (kind of like MHR, I guess). To make the mechanics reflect that, would I have to add in a resource of some sort (Fate/Action points, push dice, etc.) that need to be refreshed during transition scenes? Or would refreshing "health" at those times be appropriate?<br/><br/>The way I envision rounds is similar to Wushu, except you take turns with each die. Go around the table and ask everyone for their description and what verb (to use a Technoir description) reflects the action. Then they add that die to their pool and move on to the next person. After the scene's dice pool has been used up (say, three actions or so in normal exchanges), the dice are rolled to see the outcomes.<br/><br/>I know that doesn't answer all of the questions. I need to think on some of them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383771">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383771/#Comment_383771" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-28T14:53:24+00:00" title="June 28, 2012  2:53PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Do characters get better over time (their ability to do things consistently improves) or do they just get different (i.e. become different people, have different perspectives, learn things, have new resources and relationships)?

Most of my fiction happens around perfecting a skill or coming of age stories.<br/><br/>For instance, next week I'll be publishing the first of a series of short stories titled "Bushido".

Everyone describes actions and then rolls the results together. That keeps the action going pretty fast and cuts the time it would take on reaction rolls. I don't hate the idea of reaction rolls, but in dice pool systems they can bring combat to a screeching halt.<br/><br/>I was just going over it in my head. Characters all have the same skills (rated based on die size, as above), and they have qualities that describe what their attributes are (rather than set attributes). They announce their action, apply any qualities that would help the action, then pass to the next person. After all players have used up their dice pools for describing their actions, round-robin style, they roll the dice together.<br/><br/>For example, Rohan above might have the following qualities: Strong, Determined and Tough. When he describes the action (skill) he's using, he also describes what could apply (the Strong quality, for that <i>mighty</i> leap, for instance). <br/><br/>This didn't make it in the above post because I'm just now trying to find a way to mix it in. I'm not sure if only one quality should apply, all of them or if characters should have an exhaustible (or not) pool of dice to apply the qualities with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383786">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383786/#Comment_383786" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-28T15:47:34+00:00" title="June 28, 2012  3:47PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm kinda thinking in two different directions now, without being sure which would be more appropriate.<br/><br/>1. Have you played any Burning Wheel at all? I have a feeling you would at least get along well with the philosophy behind it.<br/><br/>2. (and on a slightly different tack)<br/>The way you described the dice pools and the two characters rolling against each other in the OP made me think it would be more appropriate as a conflict-resolution system than a task-resolution system. Then you write this here:\n<blockquote>In the first story, he learns that he's a good fighter when pitted against the average soldier, but not so good against someone who has trained all their life for fighting. Throughout the future stories, he will learn new techniques and become a better fighter.</blockquote>\nFrom this statement, it seems like you have a protagonist who, when he rolls <i>against</i> "the average soldier" does pretty well, i.e. he beats his opponent's rolls. But when he rolls <i>against</i> "someone who has trained all their life," his dice are not good enough, and he has to train and learn, and get more/better dice in order to overcome this challenge, which takes the form of a person.<br/><br/>So in this case, it doesn't seem to me like you need players taking actions in turn, or rolling dice against a target number. It seems like what you want is to pit characters against each other, in fights, conflicts, tests of skill, whatever, and see who wins and who is defeated. In which case, they should be rolling against each other. And you can move from conflict to conflict around the table, instead of from action to action.<br/><br/>Another thing you might consider is making it a <i>requirement</i> that, in order to overcome certain challenges, like that master swordsman, player characters <i>must</i> grow and learn and get better. This could range from simply taking some of the randomness of the dice out of the game, so a lucky d6 roll doesn't pwn the master's d10 roll, to characters actually being unable to win until they get an advancement related to the conflict they are trying to win.<br/><br/>Also, you're talking about keeping everyone at the table involved, which is cool, BUT in rpgs this usually represents like a gang of dudes who team up to take on a threat or challenge together. Is this a staple of your fiction? If it isn't, there are still ways to set up scenes where a single protagonist faces a challenge that include contributions from a group of players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383790">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RyanDanks" title="RyanDanks"><img alt="RyanDanks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RyanDanks">RyanDanks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383790/#Comment_383790" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-28T16:03:27+00:00" title="June 28, 2012  4:03PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, I haven't played Burning Wheel. But I have read up on it a bit.<br/><br/>If I were making the Bushido a setting for the game, that would sound very appropriate. In that series, there is only one time when the protagonist fights a gang of enemies, the rest are one-on-one duels. But that is an unlikely setting that I would run at my table, as it will be short lived (only five short stories planned for the series at the moment). I would do something similar to Cortex+ with it though, and adapt the system to the setting in a short-page-count document for people who like that setting.<br/><br/>For the more mainstream settings, since the dice pool (how many dice gets rolled per round) changes dependent on the encounter, the protagonists could split the die pool amongst each other. If the dice pool was, say, 8 for a scene involving four players and a big bad guy, the players would split the 8 dice (2 each) and the big bad guy would get a full 8 to roll against the players.<br/><br/>That is taken from Wushu. I'm not quite sure how it would play out when you apply damage to someone. Maybe the group would share a damage pool as well?<br/><br/>I kind of see where you guys are saying that the system applies to the setting specifically, and there is no generic system. But what about GURPS or Cortex+, which both use the same core system (maybe with slight changes) for each setting? Or systems like Mutants and Masterminds, which could apply to any number of settings with little adjustment?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383801">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383801/#Comment_383801" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-28T17:01:29+00:00" title="June 28, 2012  5:01PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another thing worth considering: first-time role-players won't have weird polyhedral dice lying around their house.

It revolves around building characters and playing them for long periods of time, usually in an adventure-related context.<br/><br/>If I wanted to play a short game about Jodorowsky successfully making <i>Dune</i>, GURPS would not be a very appropriate system. And it doesn't do the same genre that, say, <a href="http://www.lamemage.com/friends/My_Daughter_The_Queen_of_France.pdf" rel="nofollow">My Daughter, the Queen of France</a> does.<br/><br/>If most of your fiction is adventure fiction, though, then yeah, probably something like GURPS or Cortex or Wushu is what you want to cover your various settings. But, you know, "Strength, Dex, Health and IQ" might not be the best way to present your fiction in a gaming context, right? And if you are writing both adventure fiction and romance stories, and the same people are reading both, then a damage system is probably not the best thing to represent the commonalities between your two types of fiction. That's why I asked what kind of fiction you write, and why I say there's no real "generic" system that does any setting or genre (especially genre).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383804">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RyanDanks" title="RyanDanks"><img alt="RyanDanks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RyanDanks">RyanDanks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383804/#Comment_383804" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-28T17:21:11+00:00" title="June 28, 2012  5:21PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That makes total sense. <br/><br/>Ok, judging by my fiction, this game should focus on wide-sweeping adventures, that puts the focus on high-drama.

So, with your answers in mind, let's go back to the original example.<br/><br/>Your description is certainly action-packed, but the dice kinda call bullshit on it. I mean, basically <i>nothing happens</i>. The Dragon Lord gets his hellfire off, but Rohan succeeds in his reaction, so... nothing? So the Dragon could have been rolling a d100 and it wouldn't mean squat, basically. What if he rolled 4 or less (50 per cent chance)? He doesn't get to use it? It fizzles? That doesn't sound very high adventure to me, he's supposed to be bad ass! But those dice results don't tell me that either of these characters are bad ass, and if I was playing one of them, I wouldn't feel very bad ass.<br/><br/>Now, if you were just comparing die rolls, you might still come up with a situation where nothing happens, because if you're splitting offense and defense pools, both defense pools might overcome the offense pools. But in this case, I wouldn't be comparing my die rolls against an abstract measurement of success (or "bad-ass-itude"), I'm just comparing them to my opponent's rolls. So I can be as bad-ass as I want, and nothing tells me I can't, it just says that if I lose the conflict, my opponent gets to be <i>even more</i> bad-ass than me.<br/><br/>But, hey, maybe that doesn't work for you. If you're still set on a target number, I'd suggest lowering it to 4, at least. With your system now, d4s are not even worth rolling. I've got an idea for a step-die system of my own sitting around, and what I decided to do was that every full 4 points on a single die gives you 1 "success" or point. So if you roll 4-7, that die gets you 1 success, 8-11, 2 successes, a 12, you get 3 successes. I was figuring that you'd always be rolling around 3-5 dice, so there's little chance of getting no successes, except if you're rolling all d4s. Then you compare number of successes between characters in conflict to see who wins the conflict. But you could make larger dice even more powerful by giving 1 success for every full 3 points, making players feel even more bad-ass, and encouraging them to strive for larger dice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383831/#Comment_383831" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-28T20:17:29+00:00" title="June 28, 2012  8:17PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, Rohan healing feels really incongruous in this scene.

Either he had just moved on from another battle or they had been fighting for a while, I have no idea. I just made it up as I typed it. I also made those rolls while typing.<br/><br/>I feel you about the <i>badassery</i> feel of the whole thing. Since I was basing the round mechanic on Wushu, their descriptions happen, no matter what the dice say, and the rolls just represent plot immunity - once that goes, the coup de grace happens. Thus, the rolls failing don't represent the characters not succeeding in their actions, but they just didn't affect the plot of the character. Blood and hellfire still flies.<br/><br/>That probably wasn't a very good example, and I'll admit that I have made a lot of changes since then. I'm going to playtest it over the next few weeks and, if it turns out well, make a beta sheet for anyone who wants to try it out online.<br/><br/>By the way, that mechanic is pretty unique, and very effective for a step-die mechanic. The only concern I'd have is with all the counting during large dice pools. Although, I could see someone getting used to seeing certain numbers and automatically remembering how many successes it garners.<br/><br/>I'd be keen to try it, at any rate. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383842">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383842/#Comment_383842" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-28T22:20:08+00:00" title="June 28, 2012 10:20PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's not much more to it, so if you try it out, feel free to run with it.
