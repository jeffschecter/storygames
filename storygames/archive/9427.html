All the people I gamed with get the "feel" of the game once chargen is finished and always play characters that end up being very true to the genre.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208939">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jporrett" title="jporrett"><img alt="jporrett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jporrett">jporrett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208939/#Comment_208939" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-25T06:13:51+00:00" title="May 25, 2009  6:13AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've run it twice so far, and posted AP reports on my blog:<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://esotericmurmurs.blogspot.com/2009/01/arcus-against-black-druids.html<br/>\nhttp://esotericmurmurs.blogspot.com/2009/05/arcus-and-eyes-of-chaos.html<br/>\n<br/>\nWe've had a lot of fun with it.

Lots of flavor, good feel, extremely quick to get in motion... but. I felt there was very little tension in play. Characters are ridiculously competent, so much so that I never felt much concern that we would fail at anything significant. While this does kind of fit the source material, it wasn't terribly satisfying.<br/><br/>As is usual with this sort of game, it really seems to be all about the genre trappings and color. If your group brings those and revels in them, it's actually a really good fit. And the material in the text is very evocative and gives you plenty of fuel for it. But I don't feel that the game mechanically brought a great deal to the table in support of play.<br/><br/>On the other hand, this was 4 guys picking up the game and skimming it. There may be a bunch there that we didn't see.<br/><br/>ART was perfect.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208963">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emprint" title="Emprint"><img alt="Emprint" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emprint">Emprint</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208963/#Comment_208963" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-25T10:18:33+00:00" title="May 25, 2009 10:18AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't run it as much as I'd like. But, then, I don't do S&amp;S gaming as much as I'd like.<br/><br/>My experience was that it was a straightforward system that didn't break my assumptions about how the genre should operate. It captures the "odd jobs and adventures" feeling of characters like Conan, without bogging down character creation in complicated determinations of their history. I felt it was an ideal light system for sword and sorcery gaming.<br/><br/>I felt it paired nicely with the interpretation of the genre in <i>Sorcerer and Sword</i>, although it's much more cheerfully all-encompassing.<br/><br/>I like the sorcery system in principle, but haven't used it in practice.<br/><br/>I recorded my read-through opinions here: <a href="http://emprint.livejournal.com/190150.html#cutid1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://emprint.livejournal.com/190150.html#cutid1</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
