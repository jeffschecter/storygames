I think deciding what's important (especially what's important enough to take a risk for) is a key element of play.<br/><br/>2) Well, it kinda breaks the mood when the character seeks knowledge and the player gets it. +1 sword is a metagame abstraction for what the sword does in the story. The character shouldn't get player information. I don't see much of a problem if the player wants to ask after the game "hey what do I write on my sheet for that cool sword?" But a character's spell should at least yield character-type info.<br/><br/>2.a) Knowledge should always come at a cost.

If magic is a commodity, then "+1 sword" really could mean the same thing in-world and at the table: repeated testing has indicated that a weapon of this quality is 5% more likely in most cases to deliver a telling blow, and inflicts blows that are, on average, more telling to a degree that you can actually (but just barely) make a clear distinction between such a weapon and a lesser weapon. If magic swords have the same cultural role as modern firearms, then a short, efficient, specialized terminology is likely to emerge to talk about them. We don't talk about "partially vacant metal shells that have the strange property of deforming upon impact when fired from a piece of musketry, creating a more brutal wound thereby," we just say "hollow point slugs."<br/><br/>That commodification might not be your cup of tea, but its the whole point of, for example, Eberron (at least, that's the designer's stated intent with regards to magic), so its got at least some fans out there.<br/><br/>On a related note, if you want to do the whole magic-is-mysterious thing, you probably need to go beyond making magic hard to identify; you should probably also make it unreliable. Repeatability is the death of mystery. It's hard to not nail something down to its particulars if it always does the same thing all the time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76873">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76873/#Comment_76873" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-20T23:19:10+00:00" title="June 20, 2007 11:19PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 20, 2007 11:20PM by noclue.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think I agree. "+1 sword" is specifically a reference to +1 on a dice roll. People will develop shorthand, but they will not refer to guns (for example) as improving dice rolls without a game structure that uses dice. We quantify everything, that is true, but +1 sword is an abstraction and a player's shorthand not a term that is inherent in the setting.<br/><br/>When I said magic an mystery in the original post I wasn't really saying that magic should be mysterious, but that the world should be full of images and imagery (magical in the poetic sense). Although, I do believe that a good dose of mysterious makes magic better in gaming.<br/><br/>As for unrealiable magic, personally I find it a bit annoying. I would rather play with the cost of magic, make the choice to use it an important one, or make the cost unreliable rather than the affect. Personally, I also like making magic rare rather than commonplace (yeah, Eberron has too much of it for my tastes). But mostly, I think you can get some of this feel if you create limits to what characters can touch in the magical realm. So even the wisest mage feels like he's only touching the surface of a great ocean. He knows what he knows, but he also knows what he don't knows. This makes great sense to me. Theoretically, these folks are toying with the very stuff from which the cosmos was fashioned.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_76930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/talysman" title="talysman"><img alt="talysman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/talysman">talysman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76930/#Comment_76930" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-21T10:44:42+00:00" title="June 21, 2007 10:44AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>He's got a point.
