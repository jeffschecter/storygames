As for the specifically Tarantino thing of the talking lasting a long time and subtly navigating the characters' positions w.r.t. violence throughout, I'm quite sure there aren't any systems that do that.<br/><br/>You could probably do a <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> hack where instead of "talking / physical / punching / shooting" it's "posturing / baiting / threatening / shooting".  But even that wouldn't mechanize the core dynamics of shift-able allegiances and triggers.  You'd have to cover those things in scenario-creation and character-creation, so that's more hacking.<br/><br/>Actually, if you can work with the Anasazi color, <i>How We Came to Live Here</i> might work for this if you crank up the Inside (societal) pressures and delay or distance the Outside (wilderness, monsters) pressures.<br/><br/>The third thing I can think of is to use <i>Burning Wheel</i>'s Duel of Wits a lot, but change the way stakes are set.  Instead of being about getting NPCs to buy your side or an argument over an opponent's, you could write up some system of how each Duel establishes each participant as trustworthy or useful or dangerous or suspicious or whatever specific categories you want to break Tarantino-ism into.  The standard BW win/lose/minor compromise/major compromise rules could be used to determine degree.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450270">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450270/#Comment_450270" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-02T04:49:34+00:00" title="January  2, 2016  4:49AM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 2, 2016 4:49AM by CarpeGuitarrem.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is the sort of thing you can model with <a href="https://sethbenezra.wordpress.com/darkomengames/showdown/" rel="nofollow">Showdown</a>, I think!

The closer fights are to a 50-50 proposition, the more people will be cautious in the build up and hedge their bets. So I like using systems where a gunshot at least stands a chance of killing in a single hit.

An informed (accurate or inaccurate) impression of how quickly everyone else in the room might shoot you seems like a good thing to me.  I think a lot of the Hateful Eight dialogue takes on extra significance in this respect -- getting people to laugh or move their hands or direct their attention elsewhere often seems to push the violence a bit farther from "could erupt any second", giving whoever is prepared the advantage.  I think we can see various characters angling for that advantage ("you're lost in the moment while my hand's still by my gun") throughout the film.  "How far everyone is from the nearest gun" is also a big deal.<br/><br/>Sometimes, of course, being the first one to point guns at people just establishes you as the biggest threat/bully/jerk in the room and makes you a target...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450398">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450398/#Comment_450398" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-06T17:32:24+00:00" title="January  6, 2016  5:32PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a good insight. Perhaps a tense negotiation scene can be modeled as various characters trying to:<br/><br/>a) Get a sense for how quick their opposition is. (You don't want to draw your gun on someone who will draw faster and shoot first.)<br/><br/>b) Establish an advantage for yourself when it comes to the showdown: maneuver so as to position yourself ideally while trying to throw off your opponents (psychologically, in terms of physical location - the classic "speech from the shadow", someone moving just out of sight and delivering a monologue while their target tries to draw a bead on them - or perhaps in some other fashion).<br/><br/>If your rules include some advantage for declaring and taking aim, that could also really help. (You can choose to focus your attention on a particular enemy ahead of time, which gives you an advantage if you choose to attack them, but puts you at a disadvantage against other targets.)<br/><br/>There is now a reason to have these tense standoffs - everyone is silently/stealthily/subtly maneuvering for advantage before violence breaks out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450426/#Comment_450426" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-06T20:46:57+00:00" title="January  6, 2016  8:46PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe Fiasco would work?

In my mafia game, each character received a Family Goal assigned to them from the boss at regular intervals. These were often things like "Whack player character X". They were secret. So you never knew if the guy sitting next to you at the table had orders to kill you (and again if the system is sufficiently lethal all it takes is him getting the drop on you, so your guard is way up and you hedge).

Speaking only for myself, though, I have never seriously considered buying a game where I couldn't get answers like this first.  Anyone who skims a book off the game store shelf has this ability.  <br/><br/>For whatever this is worth, nearly all the most successful indie RPGs I know of have large and vital chunks of their innards online for free.  I'm not saying that's the best strategy for you -- I'm sure you'd know better than I would -- I'm just saying that revealing some particulars probably isn't a death knell.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450605">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hazard" title="hazard"><img alt="hazard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hazard">hazard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450605/#Comment_450605" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-13T04:51:22+00:00" title="January 13, 2016  4:51AM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">@David_Berg</a> there is an actual timer, in as much as once the heist has taken place a meet is planned for a specific time in the future. A timer/watch is set for this time.<br/><br/>As far as "innards" are concerned this is a story game free of mechanics. There's a scenario and four fleshed out characters. There's a situation which can be randomly generated or provided by the players. The only "secret stuff" is the character backgrounds which, first time, it's actually more fun to not know.<br/><br/>As far as structure, in some respects it's like Fiasco but it is more like the excellent <i>Witch: The Road to Lindisfarne</i>.<br/><br/>Although I wrote the game 20 years ago (when I didn't even know what a story game was) playing those games certainly informed some of the adjustments I made to the original game before publishing.<br/><br/>At the risk of self-promoting... here is a little more information about its production<br/><br/><a href="http://victoriaroleplaying.blogspot.ca/2013/04/faith-is-out.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://victoriaroleplaying.blogspot.ca/2013/04/faith-is-out.html</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450606">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450606/#Comment_450606" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-13T05:06:29+00:00" title="January 13, 2016  5:06AM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am glad to know all that!  Thank you.  Now I know how to parse your earlier replies, and I have a much better idea of how you tackle the issues in the opening post.  <br/><br/>Secret pre-gen character backgrounds, a starting situation which primes the pressure, designed interesting relationships between the characters and that situation, plus a countdown to a sort of "point of no return" (I assume at least some of the characters need to get certain stuff resolved before the pick-up) sounds great to me.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that most Tarantino movie characters aren't literally looking at clocks, I think there's often a similar sense of "get stuff resolved before it's too late".  Hateful Eight kind of moves between timers -- the expected storm duration, the expected appearance of other characters, etc.  Even "when the meal's over" in that grueling scene where Shosanna has to sit with Landa in Inglourious Basterds, or "when we can leave without arousing suspicion" in the same film's basement scene.  While often one character is content to wait it out (or even drag it out!), another usually isn't, and that contributes to the tension.<br/><br/>And those character-situation relationships are not the easiest thing to guarantee in "make your own" play, so I see how the pre-gens and the heist are great ingredients for that.<br/><br/>Cool stuff!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
