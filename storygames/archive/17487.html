Apocalypse World - WOW, had to do my own hack<br/>2. Archipelago II - mindblowing, a bit out of our comfort zone but worth it <br/>3. Dungeon World - approx 75% hit rate of awesome<br/>4. World of Dungeons - played several sessions but ultimately decided preferred DW<br/>5. The Regiment - one attempt not great but mitigating circumstances (me!) and will try again<br/>6. The Kingdom (playtest) - interested to play again<br/>7. Ghost/Echo - excellent, can't wait to play again with a different group<br/>8. Traveller World - needs more polish but having fun with it<br/>9. 3:16 fell a bit flat as a one-shot, probably won't bother again<br/>Edit:(I forgot) 10. Cthulhu Dark hmmm, not sure about this but CoC is a big favorite of ours,  didn't like the inversion of the SAN death spiral                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396225">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396225/#Comment_396225" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-04T15:07:10+00:00" title="November  4, 2012  3:07PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1. Vulture City (my own skirmish-drafting card game) - Really fun, with some structural inelegance that I hate.<br/>2. Montsegur 1244 - I love the game, though my play session was dissatisfying in some ways.<br/>3. Loose Leaves - A beautiful, esoteric, minimal flash of wuxia fiction. I love this game that Brendan Adkins is designing.<br/>4. Dog Eat Dog - It makes me uncomfortable in good ways, and I think it's a really interesting game. Want to play more.<br/>5. Antarktica - Steampunk imperial adventure using Archipelago. The people I played with were awesome, the game isn't for me.<br/>6. Superhero - Another tiny flash of a game (like Loose Leaves), this one by Jackson Tegu makes me feel nostalgic for all those childhood memories I haven't had yet. Funny, raucous, and somehow cozy.<br/>7. Brave Sparrow (I wrote this) - playing it has helped me clarify a lot of what it means to be human and not-human.<br/>8. The Regiment - totally not the game for me, but I can see why others would love it.<br/>9. Silver &amp; White - Is it my favourite game? Maybe. It is beautiful and teenage and real.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396226/#Comment_396226" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-04T15:11:39+00:00" title="November  4, 2012  3:11PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In order of when I first played them (thank goodness for blog-keeping to remember all this):<br/><br/>1. Dogs in the Vineyard - right at the turn of 2012, enjoyed it but think I GM'd it wrong.<br/>2. Dungeon World - One session of my own GMing, one played at GPNW, one played at the Gamerati Game Day. Loved it when I was not running it, again ran it oddly (but now know how I would do it differently).<br/>3. Microscope - Played at GPNW, loved the hell out of it.<br/>4. G.I. Joe 1946 AW Hack - Played in its first playtest at GPNW. Very fun, despite knowing nothing about GI Joe or 1946.<br/>5. Geiger World (Gamma World AW Hack) - Also a playtest at GPNW. Crazy weirdness, would play it again.<br/>6. Metamorphosis: Omicron - Tony Dowler gave the World of Dungeons treatment to Metamorphosis Alpha at GPNW. The zaniest thing I played all year, but awesome.<br/>7. D&amp;D Next - I like it better than the other D&amp;Ds I've played!<br/>8. Fiasco - I love it. Have played at least 3 times. Can't wait til Durance goes on sale.<br/>9. Apocalypse World - Finally MC'd it in September, and am still MC'ing the same characters. Made of gold, and I'm now doing my own hack.<br/>10. Monsterhearts - Played at the Gamerati Game Day. Definitely interested in playing again, and our group is is whispering about doing it.<br/>11. 13th Age - Also played at the Gamerati Game Day. Does some interesting things, probably not campaign material for me, but worth it for some.<br/><br/>For my first full year playing something that isn't D&amp;D 3.5, I think it's a pretty great haul. Can't wait to play even more next year!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Terwox" title="Terwox"><img alt="Terwox" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/482/nSPMQ33PX1PEF.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Terwox">Terwox</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396228/#Comment_396228" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-04T15:27:25+00:00" title="November  4, 2012  3:27PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1. Dungeon World - Holy crap this game is amazing and I love it -- never fails.<br/>2. Monsterhearts - Seems fantastic, but it doesn't seem suited for one GM / one player, can't wait to try w/ more.<br/>3. tremulus - Really fun, but mainly due to Stealing Cthulhu -- but I loved the framework system, really cool.<br/>4. Stealing Cthulhu - Remarkably helpful!  (Sure, not a game per se, but whatever, it was more useful than most gaming books I've read.)<br/>5. Monster of the Week - Had some trouble w/ the game steering totally towards combat, but seemed promising.<br/>6. Traveller (2nd edition?) - Around the most boring eight hours of my life, likely the GM's fault.<br/>7. AW-hacked Vampire (mine) - Surprisingly entertaining, essentially just a super-anti-heroes game -- easy to jam AW stuff together in 30 minutes on the fly and still have a decent time, which was cool to see.<br/>8. AW-hacked Council of Wyrms (mine) - Really fun, but needs something different for the more steady player versus player bits.<br/>9. Annalise - Only did the first phase a couple days ago but it seems promising, although the freeform is a bit intimidating.<br/><br/>(Discovered AW this summer, tried a ton of the variants that interested me without trying the original yet!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith" title="Keith"><img alt="Keith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/41781_139848736039153_8022_q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith">Keith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396232/#Comment_396232" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-04T15:48:59+00:00" title="November  4, 2012  3:48PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting idea for a thread.  My likely incomplete list:<br/><br/>1. Bulldogs! - My first FATE based game.  I was delighted at how well it worked.  Does exactly what it says it will.<br/>2. Monsterhearts - I like almost none of the source material, but I love playing the game.  Probably my most played game of 2012.<br/>3. In a Wicked Age - Only just got to play it last weekend.  Mechanically wonky, but creates such wonderful stories.  Playing again tonight.<br/>4. Lady Blackbird - Ran this several times and played it once.  Just super ridiculous fun.<br/>5. Danger Patrol - Not sure if we bollocksed this up or what, but it did not turn out the way I thought it would.<br/>6. Dungeon World (&amp; Number Appearing) - I much prefered playing the monsters.<br/>7. ViewScream - I decided not to include playtests, but this was so damn fun (twice).  Perpare yourselves for the VARP future!<br/>8. Within My Clutches - OK, two playtests. I'm not a superhero fan, but I really enjoyed playing a villain in David Berg's game.<br/>9. Kingdom of Nothing - Did not click with this AT ALL.<br/>10. Archipelago - Such a neat little system.  Can plug in anything and just go.<br/>11. Apocalypse World: L5R hack - Deserves to be mentioned even if it's not its own game.  Did L5R so much better than L5R does.<br/>12. Cthulhu Dark - Another sweet little system.  Could be used to port almost anything.<br/>13. Night\u2019s Black Agents - My first Gumshoe game and it was fantastic.  Hard to tell if it was the system or the fact that its author was GMing it for us.<br/>14. Sagas of the Icelanders - Just so great themematically.  Takes the AW ball and runs with it.<br/>15. Kagematsu - Not sure if I would play it again, but I enjoyed it way more than I thought I would.<br/>16. FU - Yet another rules lite do-it-all.  Used it for my <i>Dawn of the Dead / Evil Dead</i> mashup.<br/>17. S/Lay W/ Me - Quirky, maybe a little broken, but fun and very interesting.<br/>18. Murderous Ghosts - We scared the crap out of ourselves with this one.  So, that's a success.<br/><br/>Sometimes it seems like I never get to game, so it's nice to see how much gaming I've actually gotten to do.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396254">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396254/#Comment_396254" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-04T18:44:24+00:00" title="November  4, 2012  6:44PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A year is a long time. Not sure when all of the campaigns happened.<br/><br/>1. Fiasco I for sure got this year and really liked it. Played it a few times since and infected my gaming friends.<br/>2. A Dirty World also was ordered in the autumn and the one game I played really was great fun.<br/>3. Monsterhearts. Came in the same envelop as Dirty World. A good game but for the first time almost ever GMing felt like a chore for a while and did not come naturally. Still I got into the rythm and had fun. As a player over Skype with people from around here it rocked.<br/>4. Kobolds Are My Baby. Played at a Con. It was stupid fun, nothing I would buy or seek out to play again. Still not a waste.<br/>5. Eclipse Phase. Played at a con too with maybe not the best set up and GM. Still a system I generally like because of the way they publish it. Also some of the ideas appeal to me. A bit rules heavy though.<br/>6. Don't Rest your Head. With the translator at a Con too. It was nice and fun but did not convince me to get the game. Some great ideas though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark" title="Captain_Thark"><img alt="Captain_Thark" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/674/nQDB5F77NZR8N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark">Captain_Thark</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396273/#Comment_396273" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-04T22:39:26+00:00" title="November  4, 2012 10:39PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1. Fiasco: My dirty secret is that I only find it kind of OK. It's just that everyone else likes it a lot so it's great to expose people to weird RPGs.<br/>2. My Daughter Queen of France: OH MY GOD THIS GAME IS AMAZING. The emotions, the personal drama, the way you keep revising the situations. It's fantastic.<br/>3. Montsegur 1244: I wish I could have played more than half a game of it, but it was a very good half of a game. I was surprised I liked it more than Fiasco.<br/>4. Freemarket: Not a complete game, but enough of a taste to convince me I want to play a complete game of it very badly.<br/>5. D&amp;D 5e Playtest: Was very enjoyable, very freewheeling, and definitely has more spark that it's given credit for. I hope it doesn't get screwed up before it comes out.<br/>6. Keep it Sunny: Probably the best game I've played this year that will never receive the recognition of how fucking good it actually is. Is now my go to game for situations improving an episode of It's Always Sunny in Philidelphia is a good idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396283">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396283/#Comment_396283" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-04T23:35:53+00:00" title="November  4, 2012 11:35PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 4, 2012 11:36PM by Lisa Padol.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hm.... Okay, not counting larps:<br/><br/>1. Monsterhearts (Dreamation): Awesome -- I feel that I could run it.<br/>2. Technoir (Dreamation): Mixed, mostly fun, my being exhausted may have gotten in the way<br/>3. Something that was being playtested at Dreamation: I barely remember it.<br/>4. The Dance and the Dawn RPG (as opposed to the larp): Fun, but as I was warned, it is rather arbitrary.<br/>5. Smallville: Still having bumps with the system.<br/>6. Critical Go Westerly (DexCon): A game focused on Being Funny that actually worked for me.<br/>7. Night's Black Agents (DexCon): I won the tournament and got to play with Ken Hite running it, so am biased.<br/>8. Cthulhu Dark (DexCon): A lot of fun, but I think one of the GM's rules interpretations was a bit off (important because I want to know how to run the game myself)<br/>9. Progenitor (GenCon): Awesome, but I played with Greg Stolze, so am biased.<br/>10. Fate of the Norns (First Exposure, at GenCon): I had a great time, but as with 7 and 9, I played with the game's creator.<br/>11. Bollywood playtest (Metatopia): Definitely in progress, but fun.<br/>12: Titans playtest (Metatopia): Either this will become one awesome game or it will become one of two or three potential games, all of which are awesome.<br/>13. 13th Age playtest (Metatopia): Not really my thing, but I loved the One Unique Thing.<br/>14. Atomic Robo playtest: I like the streamlining of the core Fate rules and am glad I read a volume of the comic before playing.<br/>14. FATE, the in progress version, if having playtested Atomic Robo doesn't count as the same thing (Metatopia): Fun playtest of dogfighting rules.<br/><br/>This was... more games than I'd thought.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396286">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396286/#Comment_396286" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-04T23:38:02+00:00" title="November  4, 2012 11:38PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 5, 2012 12:04AM by Steve_Hickey.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1. <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5005799/grace-0.0.pdf" rel="nofollow">Grace</a> was a wonderful little one-page game and the characters we created have stuck in my memory.<br/><br/>2. Marvel Heroic Roleplaying is a bit more system-heavy than my group usually likes, so I created (and am refining) a cut-down version of the rules and am developing a process for introducing the game to people (I may post about that later, because I'm interested in how others approach this).<br/><br/>3. <a href="http://norwegianstyle.wordpress.com/2007/12/07/37/" rel="nofollow">Until We Sink</a> was a series of melancholic and low-key conversations that my group really wants to try again.<br/><br/>4. The Quiet Year. Great game with really interesting procedures that elicited a lot of different opinions from our group about how to survive and prosper, none of which helped us at all.<br/><br/>5. Companions, Jeremy Tidwell\u2019s hack of Apocalypse World to tell stories of what happens after the Doctor dies, has an amazing subtext in its setting and is rolicking good fun.<br/><br/>6. Bad Family (revised) is my game of animated family sit-com hijinks, and my playtests impressed me about how the rules can help you generate both black comedy and sweet studio-audience 'awww' moments.<br/><br/>7. In a Wicked Archipelago has produced reliably fun play both times I've played in and is now one of my go-to games.<br/><br/>8. Kingdom.

That's a lot, so in no particular order:<br/><br/>Our Last Best Hope, when it was in final beta. A very fun one-shot!<br/>Project Ninja Panda Taco, also in late beta. Silly and fun, a great game for kids, I think.<br/>Will Hindmarch's fantasy stealth game (I can't remember the name) in Playtest. Loved it, and really looking forward to seeing it developed!<br/>Poisn'd. Harsh, and not necessarily my cup of tea, I think.<br/>Cthulhu Dark. The session I was in got cut in half unexpectedly so it didn't really get a chance to work, but I liked what I saw and want to try it again.<br/>School Daze. It was an online session and frustratingly short. I want to play a full-length game sometime.<br/>Death School. Ran it for an enthusiastic table at GenCon GoD and it was a blast.<br/>Ghost/Echo. I loved the anime-flavored world that emerged from our play-through, but I am still fuzzy on how Harm and lingering goals and threats work.<br/>Rock of Tahamat the Space Tyrant. Weird and fascinating; it took a while for us to figure out how to create 'middling' results that still moved the story, but the endgame really built to an epic collapse.<br/>All Flesh Must be Eaten. Helped Playtest a convention scenario. It's a system optimized for one kind of play, but it does it pretty well! The game had a strong Resident Evil feel to it, so I enjoyed it.<br/>Serial Homicide Unit. It was a beta of a Hunger Games hack and really fun.<br/>Annalise, using Kat Jones' Dracula Reloaded; an amazingly great session.<br/>Psi*Run. It was a less-than-optimal table and situation. It really fell flat for me, I want to try it again with friends on the same page.<br/><br/>Wait, did Marvel Heroic just release this year? Holy crap! So, yeah, that's the one I payed the MOST that just came out in 2012.<br/><br/>I probably missed one or two, but if I can't remember they either didn't make an impression or i am misremembering exactly the first time I played. There were certainly several systems I had GMed but got to play as a player for the first time and vice versa, too. (Matt, was our Ridde of Steel game this year or last?)<br/><br/>Intending/really wanting to try but never got to: Durance, Always/Never/Now, revised 1001 Nights, Atomic Robo, the Regiment, Mouse Guard. <br/><br/>Wow, what a good year. Bring it, 2013!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396386/#Comment_396386" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-05T11:23:54+00:00" title="November  5, 2012 11:23AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Off the top of my head, I remember playing for the first time (in no particular order):<br/><br/>Dramasystem<br/>Durance<br/>Perfect Unrevised<br/>Ocean<br/>Dungeon World<br/>Apocalypse World<br/>The Shab Al-Hiri Roach<br/>Kagematsu<br/>Snapshot 1969<br/><a href="http://nickwedig.libraryofhighmoon.com/2012/09/nameless-horror/" rel="nofollow">Several</a> <a href="http://nickwedig.libraryofhighmoon.com/2012/06/house-of-masks-new-playtest-version/" rel="nofollow">games</a> <a href="http://nickwedig.libraryofhighmoon.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/project-phaeton-one-page11.pdf" rel="nofollow">that I</a> <a href="http://nickwedig.libraryofhighmoon.com/2012/09/sophies-pirate-game/" rel="nofollow">wrote</a>.<br/><br/>There's still time left, though, and at least one con and one playtest scheduled for the next month.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396390">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396390/#Comment_396390" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-05T11:30:30+00:00" title="November  5, 2012 11:30AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's sad how little gaming I've been able to do this year.

So I pulled it up, and have been carrying it as my burden/shield/two-handed great weapon ever since.</blockquote>\nIt's true. Last time I saw Joe he had it.<br/><br/>Me, leaving out my stuff:<br/><br/>1. <b>Monsterhearts</b>: Meh until I played it, then Hot For It. Playing a multiple-session game of this is on the upper-middle-class of my list.<br/><br/>2. <b>Sorcerer</b>: Yeah, baby. The game was really great, but playing it on Hangouts hampered it a bit, for me. Running a Sorcerer &amp; Sword game soon, and I have <i>never</i> been more excited to run anything.<br/><br/>3. <b>Maid</b>: Ran this for six people. Not an ideal setup, but it worked, and was all the hilarity you'd expect from a Maid game. Brought in a rando who came with like 15 pre-made characters and utterly did not know how to play a game with other human beings, but that's not the game's fault. Would love to play 3-4 sessions with 3-4 Maids.<br/><br/>4. <b>Lamentations of the Flame Princess</b>: Played in a one-shot with 8 people, which is kind of my nightmare when it comes to games, unless there's lots of care taken in the design with that particularly high number. I got nearly killed in the first encounter and was out of the game for most of it. I want to play it again, with the right group that is focused laser-like on the particular kind of challenge-laden play it supports. Basically this is me wanting to taste what old-school D&amp;D is like, but with better color and a better character sheet.<br/><br/>5. <b>Montsegur 1244</b>: We didn't finish, but real good all the same. Need to play this again in a langorous setting, where we know it will take five hours.<br/><br/>6. <b>44</b>: pretty much the same thing Jonathan said (we played in the same game). Cool, creepy fiction until the mechanics kind of broke on us.<br/><br/>7. <b>Hot Guys Making Out</b>: Played this twice, with two very different outcomes. Once it was all hot burning romance set against the sketchy backdrop of the Spanish Civil War, and once the war broke into our game, with an in-check romance taking place in the basement with all characters present, while soldiers looted the manse above us. Great stuff.<br/><br/>8. <b>Polaris</b>: I've wanted to play this forever, and hadn't even read my book until a week before play! What to say except: it delivered, and then some. Extremely evocative, extremely colorful.<br/><br/>9. <b>Serpent's Tooth</b>: Liked it a great deal, and now that I have the box I think this will be a go-to with many great sessions ahead. When I played it it was in playtest.<br/><br/>10. <b>The Wilding Tales</b>: Joel Shempert's pick up and play(test) game of round-robin storytelling in a post-apocalypse. Quick and grabby. I hope he finishes it.<br/><br/>11. <b>Fedora Noir</b>: Morgan Stinson's playtest noir-mystery game. It really feels like you're solving a mystery! There's a detective, a hat (who speaks the detective's thoughts and can solve the mystery), a partner, and a femme fatale (in the version I played). Lots of fun props, like cigarettes, shot glasses, a fedora, a toy gun. You can pull the gun out to have two guys enter the room with guns! Doesn't the name have the best assonance <i>ever</i>? Morgan is a really sweet guy with some very thoughtful concerns about the genre tropes he is playing with, and I hope he can make it work for himself and for us, because you'll like this game.<br/><br/>10: <b>Letting Go</b>: A playtest of a game by Orion Canning and Robert Bruce about letting go of a dead loved one. Some really amazing stuff in there. You start the game by making relationships between characters based on a wedding they were all at, fleshing out the characters from there. Once you're all bought-in to the characters and their deal, and they feel like real people, everyone draws a card. High card: You're dead! Who was closest to the person who died? You're the Bereaved. You're the main character and we play out the Stages of Grief, which also come with magical realism powers. Fuck. Some of the best play I've had all year. I am really loving some of the different styles of play that Oly folks are introducing me to, such as really fucking long scenes. <br/><br/>Maybe more? I've played a ton of games this year that I've played before, but only once or so. This year I got to dig deeper with a lot of stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tore_V" title="Tore_V"><img alt="Tore_V" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tore_V">Tore_V</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396552/#Comment_396552" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-06T06:16:36+00:00" title="November  6, 2012  6:16AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Three campaigns of Monsterhearts.<br/>Six games I ran at Fastaval.<br/><br/>Hmmmm, seems that was it...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396555">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason" title="Joe_Beason"><img alt="Joe_Beason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason">Joe_Beason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396555/#Comment_396555" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-06T06:35:51+00:00" title="November  6, 2012  6:35AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 6, 2012 6:42AM by Joe_Beason.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Monsterhearts - wonderful game, very well suited to my go-to character: overwrought and sex-obsessed<br/>Monster of the Week - another great game; I would like to play a long-form game of this one day<br/>The Play's the Thing - just a short con game.

Absolutely cutting-edge brilliant in a pure design sense, and great fun besides. <br/><br/>The Final Girl - great low-key game to play with strangers and/or die-hard horror people. I'm a big fan! <br/><br/>Vesna Thaw - worked better than I thought it would! I'm biased, but I managed to charm myself with it, which is nice (also, don't worry Joe, I feel the same way vis. Be Ashamed Young Prince)<br/><br/>Drifters Escape - had a little trouble getting into the mindset for it, but enjoyed it enough to want to play again. I just bought a copy at Metatopia!<br/><br/>Playtesting an unnamed epic fantasy game that Tim Kleinart is working on, and I'm super pumped for it, tho it clearly needs a lot of development. <br/><br/>Playtesting my own stuff, doesn't count. <br/><br/>Playtested a wacky time-travel-hi jinks game by the Jankcast folks. Had a good time, and hopefully gave some productive feedback, but its aiming for a play experience that isn't really my thing. <br/><br/>Dungeon World - large convention game (7 players, I think). My Paladin got to be totally badass, but its not really my thing (along with the whole world of D&amp;D clones/homages/remixes/etc)<br/><br/>Hero's Banner - finally! Great game, sadly cut short by the one-session format. It's a little more hard edged that most contemporary designs, but I really enjoy the stark clarity of the hard-choices paradigm that it inhabits. Want to play a long term / generational game. <br/><br/>Hero Wars - guys, this game has so much good stuff that's kind of worked its way into modern game design DNA. I'm in a long-term game of it now, and I'm learning a lot (though I'm not sold on the usefulness of some of the subsystems). Also, I love how all the characters are total badasses in their own ways. <br/><br/>Fiasco - I get why it's a great game, but its not for me. Played twice, and don't see myself playing again outside of exceptional circumstances. <br/><br/>Dirty Secrets - just played this over the weekend at Metatopia and daaaaamn. The central resolution mechanic was confusing for me (and needlessly fiddly overall, I think), but the structural and procedural elements are ahead of their time and extremely productive and fun. The group I played with was great, and it was just a standout session despite my issues with the dice. <br/><br/>How We Came To Live Here - just started. So excited. Been wanting to play this forever. <br/><br/>And there's still time for more!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396576/#Comment_396576" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-06T09:34:19+00:00" title="November  6, 2012  9:34AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 6, 2012 9:34AM by ndp.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whoops double post                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396591">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396591/#Comment_396591" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-06T10:17:30+00:00" title="November  6, 2012 10:17AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 6, 2012 12:51PM by Joe_McGuffin.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Hero Wars - guys, this game has so much good stuff that's kind of worked its way into modern game design DNA.

HW was also my intro to Glorantha, which is probably my favorite fantasy setting (that I've yet to run more than a one-shot in).<br/><br/>My list:<br/><br/>13th Age: Played one session during the playtest and was faintly disappointed (I was hoping Heinsoo and Tweet would let their pre-D20 freak flags fly a little more), but this is probably the version of D&amp;D I would play if I was in the market for that.<br/><br/>Ars Magica:  Been wanting to play this for a long time.  Some things surprised me during play (starting magi aren't nearly as omnicompetent as their descendents in Mage: the Ascension led me to believe), but usually in a good way.  Sadly, it is a fairly demanding game as far as interfacing with the rules goes and right now I'm just not comfortable with that level of homework.  I definitely want to play again sometime when/if I am in the mood for that level of character maintenance.<br/><br/>Black Seven: Metal Gear Solid the RPG is a pretty great idea.  Not quite as limited a genre as you may think (this game actually models Raiders of the Lost Ark almost exactly on a scene-by-scene basis), but still something I'd run <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/390844#Comment_390844" rel="nofollow">the occasional one-shot of</a> as opposed to a steady diet.<br/><br/>Changeling the Lost: This started last fall and ended in January so I'm going to count it.

My players got over excited and created an epic lord of rings plot we could never hope to complete.<br/>6. The Quiet Year. 'Tokens of Contempt' such a great mechanic.  My wife says we should use them round the house.<br/>7. Lady Blackbird. Another microcosmic masterpiece. The joy of watching my trad friends eyes light up as they realised they could take the story anywhere.<br/>8. Dungeon World. I am 12 again and dungeons are once again dark terrifying places. I can't stop thinking about it. It demands a campaign.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396812/#Comment_396812" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-07T22:11:42+00:00" title="November  7, 2012 10:11PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 7, 2012 10:11PM by Steve_Hickey.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><i>'Tokens of Contempt': such a great mechanic.

I couldn't get a good read on the game in one session.<br/><b>Microscope</b> - Great for what it is.  I'm not certain I'd call it a game, but fun.<br/><b>The One Ring</b> - The closest thing to an old-school RPG I played this year.

Thought of idea for new My Life with Master scenario "Groom-ing the Bridezilla"<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">May</span><br/><b>Microscope </b>- the game I had of it was solid though unexceptional. The game mechanics though were a revelation. I got into story gaming in order to find out about collaborative storytelling methods that would give me a new angle on devising theatre. I tried it with a <a href="http://www.ukroleplayers.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=162&amp;t=12087" rel="nofollow">mix of systems</a> before and it didn't work out when I put it in front of actors. Microscope, I realised, is the game I came to story gaming for. I haven't done a complete production with the new approach yet, but the pilot workshop was promising. With the addition of elements from Forsooth!, Durance and some basic story gaming concepts, I have every hope that we'll be able to put together better play settings quicker.<br/><br/><b>Monsterhearts</b> - my <a href="http://www.ukroleplayers.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=162&amp;t=13122" rel="nofollow">first one-shot</a> was totally awesome. My others couldn't come up to the same level. I don't tend to replay games that much, but MH is definitely one that keeps drawing me back in.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">June</span><br/><b>Cthulhu Dark Bank Heist hack</b> - solid and completely memorable for the following: the GM left us for 30 mins to devise a plan on how to rob the bank. When he came back, the first thing we told him was "Okay, we're going to make a bomb and pretend to blow up a shopping mall across town."<br/><br/><b>Fiasco </b>(Elizabethan spy playset) - this was my first actual game of this story game standard-bearer. It lived up to it's name.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">August</span><br/><b>Narrative Pursuits</b> (playtest) - this surprised me by how well it worked. I think a key moment was when the group decided to play with a serious tone and we ended up as Jews in fear of our lives in Nazi-occupied Poland. <br/><br/><b>Dread Jenga</b> - I'm not sure if it was the tower or the players or the GM or the combination, but <a href="http://www.ukroleplayers.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=162&amp;t=13682" rel="nofollow">powerful, powerful stuff</a>. And, as every new Dread Jenga player, I came away from it wondering how I could incorporate Buckaroo, Operation, Hungry, Hungry Hippos and other childhood games as a resolution mechanic.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">September</span><br/>I ran a few games at the Cow, the only first one was the one I called the Scream (which I'll probably call the Silent Game from now on). Super players who didn't blink at what was demanded of them and got straight into the spirit of it and a surprisingly fulfilling off-the-cuff adventure.<br/><br/><b>Witch </b>- With all the bigging up in the UK, I was wary about this one and even warier as the author talked us through the set-up, but I was happily surprised with it. A nice, simple game where you get out of it as much as you put in.<br/><br/><b>Forsooth!</b> - We ended up creating a play called <a href="http://www.ukroleplayers.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=162&amp;t=13855" rel="nofollow">Love Lies Bleeding</a>. This game ends up with madder, more convoluted stories than Fiasco and a 6 man game of Monsterhearts combined! I'm really glad it exists, it's a big help. I want to play it some more, but I want to put a bit more structure in it to contain the madness. I also want to do a Commedia version.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">October</span><br/><b>Kingdom </b>(playtest) - Note my gushing about Microscope above. I really wanted to see what this game had. Maybe it was our setting choice, but it felt like a lot of effort to get going. Microscope doesn't give you a lot of help, but then the whole game is really creating the setting. For Kingdom, I needed more help. There's a good mechanic in there, but I'm not sure if there was enough around it. Probably need a saner game of it to give a proper opinion. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">November</span><br/>Who knows? I'm hoping I might get a chance with Hillfolk though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
