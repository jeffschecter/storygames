He's itching to play a character, and mine is nicely poised to retire to safety or die trying, so we've decided that I'll MC next.<br/><br/>Matt and I have been having chats for a few years about the character-POV style of immersion that characterizes some of my favorite games, and Matt has argued to me that AW is well designed to support that.  So, I'm going to give it my best shot, but some advice would be handy!  (Even if the advice is: "Don't try it.")<br/><br/>As a player, of all the times I've ever tried to do a Move, here's my best guess at the breakdown of Matt's MC responses:<br/>1) 95% -- Okay, roll!<br/>2) 4% -- I don't think that would work here, but feel free to try something else.<br/>3) 1% -- I don't think that would work, you're taking forever, the situation escalates, <i>now</i> what do you do?<br/>4) 0% -- Okay, you try it- Stop!  Don't roll!  It doesn't work.*<br/>5) 0% -- Okay, roll!  You got a 10?  Well, for some reason, it doesn't work!<br/><br/>There are very good reasons for these percentages.  However, the end result is that, as a player, I know I have the ability to rule certain possibilities (and even probabilities) into and out of the fiction.  This creates an information mismatch between me and my character.<br/><br/>My character is talking to an NPC.  The MC roleplays their disposition as distrustful and taciturn.  And yet, I know that all I need to do is announce an attempt to read them, and I have a high chance of finding out what they want.  But my character doesn't know this!  If I'm trying to imagine the fictional situation from my character's POV, I'm going, "Crap, they're not gonna talk."  But as a player, I know they probably are, because there's a rule that says so and all the other players keep using it.<br/><br/>So, back to the 5 responses above.  Without other options on the table, <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> and <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> wind up as preludes to <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, which can't help with the player/character information mismatch.  <a href="/forums/search?Search=%235&amp;Mode=like">#5</a> seems like a dick move that would break resolution.  So, what do you think about <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a>?  <br/><br/>Allowing "you don't know what's possible/probable until you try" into the range of interactions between character and world would better synchronize player and character points of view.  But it might also undermine the way Moves are currently guaranteed to push the narrative forward.<br/><br/>All this is just a first guess.  "Try adding uncertainty between initiation and execution" is all I've come up with so far.  Maybe other options would be better for character POV and/or have less downside.  Any advice would be much appreciated!<br/><br/>Ps,<br/>-David<br/><br/>*or, "It works easily."                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310842">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310842/#Comment_310842" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-03T11:26:35+00:00" title="February  3, 2011 11:26AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<img alt="image" src="http://www.dclxvi.org/chunk/what/image/hires/portraitdopus0150.jpg"/><br/><br/><a href="http://www.dclxvi.org/chunk/what/" rel="nofollow">"After the apocalypse, everything will change, including the laws of physics as we know them.

I'm not saying it doesn't exist, just that it's never happened to me.<br/><br/>Here's an example:<br/><br/>My operator, Lafferty, is talking to some scrawny cockroach named Rolfball.  Lafferty wants to know where a missing member of his crew is and Rolfball doesn't want to tell him.  I look down at Lafferty's sheet and (just making this up on the fly here) he's got Hard+2, Hot+1, Sharp+1, Cool+1, and Weird-1.  So Lafferty's a tough-ass dude who's also fairly sexy, perceptive, and slick, but he doesn't traffic with that psychic maelstrom bullshit.  If I want Rolfball to spill the beans, there are a bunch of different things that I could try.  I could just offer him some jingle (Barter) to bribe him for the info.  I could threaten him with a beat-down (Go Aggro).  I could offer him sex or try to convince him that he should just tell me (Seduce or Manipulate).  I could try to read his body language to see what he's hiding (Read a Person). Normally, I could ask the psychic maelstrom where my crew member is, but Lafferty hates doing that (partially because he's bad at it).  Or if I've got other crazy moves, I could use those.  Or, perhaps best of all, I can just start doing things fictionally, based on what I think Lafferty would do, until it's clear to either me or the GM that I'm making a move.  If you really want to immerse in AW, honestly, I'd suggest the latter approach, letting the moves emerge naturally from the fiction rather than picking the move you want to do and then having the GM ask you: "Okay, how do you do that?"<br/><br/>So, let's say things work like this:<br/><br/>JWALT: "Rolfball, if you have any idea where Clarion is, you best tell me quick." I glare at him.<br/>MC: Rolfball hesitates and looks over one shoulder, as if checking to see if he's been watched. "Told you, don't know nuffin 'bout nuffin."<br/><br/>At this point, I don't need to Read A Person, because I already know 1) he's lying, and 2) he's worried about the consequences of squealing, probably because someone else might come kill him.  That's just from the fiction.<br/><br/>JWALT: "What are you scared of, Rolfball? Who's got you all spooked."<br/>MC: "I don't know what you're jabbin' about. Nobody messes with Rolfball." He scampers a few feet away and starts going through the drawers of his cabinet.<br/>JWALT: I walk over and put a hand on his shoulder. "You don't got to worry about anyone hurting you, Rolfball.  I just want to find Clarion.  You can come with me if you like and I'll make sure nobody does you no harm for a good deed."<br/>MC: So... you're manipulating him, by offering him protection?<br/>JAYWALT: ....Uh, yeah, I guess I am.  So I roll+Hot?<br/>MC: Yup.<br/><br/>Does that help?  Do you see what I'm saying?  Am I not understanding your question right?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310865/#Comment_310865" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-03T12:42:11+00:00" title="February  3, 2011 12:42PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, guys.  I appreciate your thoughts on this topic.  Unfortunately, I've tried most of these already.<br/><br/><b>On declaring moves:</b><br/><br/>Early in this game, I used to just roleplay the conversation with the NPC, and eventually the MC would say "are you trying to Read a Person?"  Well, yeah, I guess I am.  Now I know what to roll (+Sharp), but I also know that I can learn how to get what I want from him, even though the fiction hasn't offered that as a possibility.<br/><br/>Since it didn't make any difference, I eventually adopted the shorthand the other players were all using, and said, "I try to Read him."<br/><br/>One could just blame my play group for thinking mechanics-first instead of fiction-first, but I don't think that's fair.  Everyone looks at their sheet and uses the move they have a +3 in and which lists stuff they want among its success outcomes.  Why?  Because they want to know their options, and what's the best way to get what they want -- same as in any other game.  <i>Not</i> doing this takes a certain level of discipline and clarity of priorities that I think is a tall order.<br/><br/><b>On move results in the fiction:</b><br/><br/>Learning how to get what you want from someone in the real world <i>who is specifically trying to hide that</i> involves a long, multi-step process, possibly months of building trust, demonstrating value, learning weaknesses, earning favors, gaining leverage, etc.  It can be done!  And maybe it can be done quicker by a badass!  But in one quick conversation?  I'd have to see it to believe it.  Which I'd love to try!  But we haven't been roleplaying out situations where the rules tell the player "Ask the MC this question, which they must answer honestly."<br/><br/>I guess I could ask Matt to roleplay out his MC answers rather than answering directly, but that seems completely socially unfeasible.  I mean, that is asking a lot out of him (to invent and portray the NPC's process of coming around) and the other players (to stay enthused through a long one-on-one, when a single sentence would have gotten the fiction to the same point).<br/><br/><b>On character badassery:</b><br/><br/>1) Having decent odds to do something nearly-impossible, but also decent odds to fail, doesn't really say "badass" to me.  "Living an adventurous life of extremes," perhaps.  I still don't know why people should tell me stuff they'd never tell anyone else under similar circumstances.<br/><br/>2) I don't <i>want</i> to be <i>such</i> a badass that the apocalypse becomes a light-hearted romp.  So yeah, I <i>could</i> answer any cognitive dissonance with, "Well, cuz I'm special, mufuckaz!" but I don't want to.<br/><br/>Before I get a billion responses about playing wrong, let me reiterate that these are<i> from the perspective of someone <b>trying to immerse in character POV</b></i>.

You are a unique and special ashflake (snowflake), and you know it. So to me that doesn't mean you'll never fail, or that you'll never have really shitty odds, or that you'll never get your ass beaten into the ground... rather that those things don't really affect you. You do what you do anyway.<br/><br/>Your character might not ever think "Shit, he's not going to talk," and give up. Or maybe he will realize that the guy is never going to talk, but he's going to interrogate him anyway, because he's a badass. Later on in the evening when he's picking up his teeth off the ground and vowing revenge... well, that's a cool scene too, and I don't think it takes away from the badass nature of your character.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if this helps in any way, I just wanted to get it out.

The problem (for my particular style of immersion) is that we <i>choose</i> actions based on the Moves and all the knowledge we have about them.<br/><br/>I suspect it's not possible to decouple the use of the Moves from the Moves' probabilities and effects and still be playing AW.  Thus my thoughts about changing the process that leads up to using a Move.  If we had <b>less certainty about when we could/would employ a Move</b>, we might go back to making decisions based on the fiction...?<br/><br/>An alternative or complementary approach could be to <b>narrate the fuck out of each move outcome once</b>, so we have a fictional referent for subsequent uses.  Like, if we played through a month of "find out how to get him to do what you want" once, then we could just do "a month later:" for future uses.

Or if you were, you don't know it (which is more likely). It doesn't take months just to get someone to give a hint about interests they usually keep veiled.<br/><br/>Look at how femme fatale characters are portrayed in noir movies. Real people can really be that good at manipulating.<br/><br/>All the Move is supposed to do is give you some extra insight, right? (I am speaking from ignorance, haven't read the game). It doesn't completely win the conflict for you with one roll. It gives you information that you didn't have before. But as was previously mentioned, that information could be "This guy is guarded. You're not going to get what you want just by asking for it."<br/><br/>But that result can come about through descriptive fiction, rather than an OOC statement from the MC, just as you would deliver a physical result through description.<br/><br/>The choice to initiate the roll can come from the character. It's the choice to turn on the charm. Make some piercing eye contact. Ask a provocative question. Pay close attention to the response that gives.<br/><br/>That's it, really.

In the case of Read a Person, you know what your list of questions is, and due to the nature of dice rolls in AW, you know your odds of being able to ask one question. In the "real world", you have no way of knowing that you'll ever be able to find out what a certain person wants. In AW, you know your odds for doing that, exactly.<br/><br/>In a trad GM fiat/Rule Zero/task resolution game, there is a much stronger element of mystery. Each time you go to roll the dice, or each time you try to do anything in the fiction, you literally have no idea whatsoever how it will end. Maybe you will roll the dice and something terrible will happen to your character. Maybe you won't roll the dice, and instead you'll just get what you want. Maybe you'll really well and still not get what you want (in which case you know you're facing some unusual opponent or some unusual situation). <br/><br/>The process of playing the game is a mysterious black box, not unlike real life (and especially mysterious, weird, unusual situations in real life).<br/><br/>Of course, this breaks down for more experienced/less gullible/older gamers when you start to see the social patterns underlying it all. It's not that hard to go from "mysterious fiction" to "OK, I know Dave, and when he arches his eyebrow it means that he knows he should tell me what the NPC's thinking, but he doesn't want to because he thinks it would make the game 'too easy' for me."<br/><br/>I'm not convinced there's a solution to this whole conundrum.<br/><br/>My solution at this point is to realize that, yeah, we're playing a game, and suspend my sense of disbelief. If I can imagine that Dave's voice is the husky tone of a femme fatale, I can easily imagine that this die roll here is somehow reflected in the fiction. (An obvious one being that, yeah, obviously my character is so slick that he can just read the crap out of people.)<br/><br/>I also find, perhaps ironically, that stakes-setting games allow me to do this better, in a way. In AW, you effectively always know what the outcome *can* be. If you're setting stakes, though, you might have dramatically different results from the same "move", coloured in different ways, depending on the situation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310955/#Comment_310955" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-03T18:38:53+00:00" title="February  3, 2011  6:38PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 3, 2011 6:52PM by David_Berg.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Rob</b>, I think you're incorrectly assuming the extent of what a successful move can establish into the fiction.

For this thread (and for other stuff on Delve), I'm talking about losing myself in my character's sense of place and knowledge -- acting, reacting, and making decisions as if I were there, in the fiction.  To that end, yeah, taking attention off physical play props tends to help.  That's not the goal in itself, though.  <br/><br/>[Edited to add:] Actually, fuck it, that was a wussy response.

I guess I should just speak for myself when saying that I think it might be nice.  <br/><br/>As for the more extensive "hide the mechanics" hack, I'm still definitely down to try that!  I'm really curious about the psychological difference between "the GM is making shit up" and "the GM is rolling for we-don't-know-exactly-what behind his screen".

I'd like to see it...<br/><br/>As for AW:<br/><br/>How the hell would you do "blind" AW? I don't see why you can't have the players roll the dice: it doesn't make them imagine less fiercely. The key is them not knowing why they're rolling the dice, or what the odds are: no connection to the mechanics of play.<br/><br/>But how can you handle this using the lists in AW? The players need to see the lists. I could see printing them out and showing them the appropriate list at the appropriate time... but even that would become predictable after you've long enough.<br/><br/>You could try to couch the terms of the list in fictional misdirection. (e.g. instead of "Do they mark experience or do they act under fire?" You could say, "Are you trying to approach them all friendly-like, guiding them to the answer you think is best, or are you trying to intimidate them, shake them, get them flustered, etc?") But, man, I think that would be really hard to do for some moves (especially the one I chose, right there).<br/><br/>Plus, stuff like advancing the character (choosing new moves, etc) is very anti-immersive, I think. (Especially moves that essentially just give you a bonus to stuff, instead of changing anything fictional, like some of the substitute-one-stat-for-another moves.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_310974">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310974/#Comment_310974" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-03T19:56:19+00:00" title="February  3, 2011  7:56PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul: actually, rolling the dice and not being allowed to know what they mean drives me absolutely batshit about Delve and trad games generally, which is the whole impetus behind this idea!

I'm totally on your side: understanding what the dice are and what you're rolling, etc, can really help immerse. Not knowing what it means at all is pretty... misleading, sometimes. I agree with you on this point.<br/><br/>That said, given a game where the rules are not exposed to the players, and the dice rolled are the same every time, I wouldn't have any qualms about rolling the dice rather than having the GM roll everything. It gives you a certain sense that you have a hand in your character's fortunes. <br/><br/>This might be a matter of taste; I don't know. I like having something to do (roll dice) rather than sitting there and waiting for the GM to do it. And it's fun to have some sense that, for instance, "Hey, when I'm violent, I tend to get my way even when I roll poorly, but the opposite is true when I try to seduce someone. Maybe I'm not as charming as I think I am?" That kind of organic discovery of character can be a fun design feature.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_310981">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310981/#Comment_310981" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-03T20:05:20+00:00" title="February  3, 2011  8:05PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Oh, and: why is the framework of AW a good match for Delve, then?

Walton</cite>David: Sounds like you might be looking for a structured freeform version of AW.  Would something like <a href="http://thouandone.wordpress.com/2011/02/01/apocalypse-world-structured-freeform-take-1/" rel="nofollow">this</a> or this work better for you?</blockquote>\nThat AW freeform idea is slick.  It opens up a lot of possibilities for ways to narrate resolution.  Putting immersion-fostering techniques on top of that wouldn't be hard.  The token economy might deform incentives in some weird way, but I'd have to try it to find out.  I don't think I'll get the chance with my current group, but I may come back to this at some point.  Thanks!<br/><br/>The Ghost Opera thing seems like it would absolutely rely on a strong set of player skills and priorities to not devolve into a mess.  I'd try it if I had a good trad group utterly sold on an aesthetic premise.  It might work well as an empowered Cthulhu thing, for example.  Personally, AW's apocalyptica doesn't grab me that way, but that might just be me...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311225">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311225/#Comment_311225" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-05T04:10:42+00:00" title="February  5, 2011  4:10AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Synching player/character knowledge through all 3 variants using the same resolution system is hard!</blockquote>New idea.
