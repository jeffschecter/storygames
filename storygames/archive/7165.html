I wrote that "story" means a lot of things. <br/><br/>I think the useful question is not "what is story?" but "what structure and elements do you want in the stories you play?"<br/><br/>These are elements of form, because form is what gives meaning. Just ask a film editor -- he chooses to arrange clips in particular ways to produce particular impacts on the audience. That's all form. Form applied to content brings meaning. And for similar reasons the writer and the director each have input into what content to provide and in what order.<br/><br/>So for example, do you prefer a story to have a moment where a character gets what they deserve? <br/><br/>Of do you like stories that start in the middle, then introduce the elements, then resolve success or failure of the activity?<br/><br/>Do you prefer characters who are challenged by internal demons or external forces or both?<br/><br/>What structure and elements do you want in the stories you play?<br/><br/>Do you see them in the game designs you like?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_159522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/159522/#Comment_159522" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-29T14:38:12+00:00" title="July 29, 2008  2:38PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm currently writing the Pentasystem exactly to produce the kinds of stories I like. <br/><br/>That is, stories in which people engage in conflict because of things they care about, are changed by the conflicts they engage in, and triumph through sacrifice and through putting their self-definition on the line. <br/><br/>All of these are specifically built into the mechanics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_159526">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/159526/#Comment_159526" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-29T14:41:02+00:00" title="July 29, 2008  2:41PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like nemesis characters that have multiple run-ins with my characters, confounding me yet making me all the more keen on their re-appearance and eventual comeuppance<br/><br/>I have a total weakness for grand and convoluted quests to save the world<br/><br/>I like those stories where the characters realize they are exposed, exhausted, hunted and up against the wall, but find some way to triumph through that adversity by the skin of their teeth through dint of determination and quick thinking                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_159590">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/159590/#Comment_159590" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-29T16:39:18+00:00" title="July 29, 2008  4:39PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alan</cite>do you prefer a story to have a moment where a character gets what they deserve?</blockquote>\nI always put one of these in for someone.

They want a lead-in, they want to have things introduced, they want to invest in it, then and only then will they care if I upend it.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alan</cite>Do you prefer characters who are challenged by internal demons or external forces or both?</blockquote>\nNormally, I really like external forces that hit the characters very hard where they are very strong.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
