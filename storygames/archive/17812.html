They present alternate (and, for the most part, superior, but I'll get into detail below) rules on some matters from the core book.<br/><br/>Here is my contribution:<br/><br/>A. From the Companion: <br/><br/>1) Ditch Luck, and replace it with Drama (which all PCs have and which does not take up a Spiritual Attribute slot). I've never loved the Companion's (lack of) guidelines for giving Drama, though, so last time I ran TRoS (in an epic all-nighter entitled "Night of Blood and Dice") I made it work like fanmail, where each PC could be awarded up to one point of Drama per scene. But Drama is flat-out better than Luck, though I can see people feeling like it makes the game too easy.<br/><br/>2) Allow Oath as a new SA category. Nicely distinct from Drive, since an Oath is external and in-fiction in a way the purely internal Drive is not. (I also enjoy the commentary on Destiny, but it's not really anything I didn't already know, thanks to the excellent job Ben Lehman did in teaching me the game's concepts.)<br/><br/>3) I use the Skill Packets presented in the Companion\u2014they're a bit more logical than core. Also, I use the rule that everyone gets a small third skill packet based on their social class. In addition, the rules addressing high mastery skills, extended contests, etc, have been useful from time to time. (Especially since skills are one of the weaknesses of core, in many people's opinions, )<br/><br/>4) There are several alternate methods of chargen presented in the Companion. I have used different combinations of them at different times, and generally enjoyed being able to tailor chargen to the type of game I'm running. Especially for one-shots you often want people to have an Epic pick (worked great for Riddle of Shell, my ninja turtles game :-) ).<br/><br/>5) The expanded lists of Advantages and Disadvantages presented here are welcome, but still not really enough in my experience.<br/><br/>B. From TFoB:<br/><br/>1) Basically all the combat rules in the first part of the book\u2014I find both archery and wrestling cleaner the way it's presented there, as well as some stuff about armor. The new Terrain rules are more of an expansion than a replacement, but they're pretty great.<br/><br/>2) The new Maneuvers are mostly fine, though I've never played long enough to have anyone learn <i>Meisterhau</i> (Masterstrike), more's the pity. Disarm, in particular, was a notable absence from core, and comes up a lot\u2014in particular I love that it can be done defensively, albeit with difficulty. Quick-Draw's a little confusing\u2014is it something you do in conjunction with another Maneuver, or as part of a Terrain roll?<br/><br/>3) The new combat styles and the master list of defaults are great! The guidelines for designing your own styles are awesome too\u2014I had to design a Sai style for Raphael and a Nunchuks style for Michelangelo in TMNT, as well as a hatchet-and-dagger proficiency for Night of Blood and Dice (we were doing a Last of the Mohicans-inspired game).<br/><br/>4) I like the expanded weapon list in general, but some of it is kind of dumb.<br/><br/>5) I've never had much use for the poisons or magic items sections, but hey, it's nice that they're around in case!<br/><br/>6) Mass combat is pretty clunky and I probably wouldn't use it without good reason.<br/><br/>C. Pure houserules.<br/><br/>Not much! There is some ambiguity in core, as I recall, about when exactly you earn SA points. I've always played it that you earn the point the moment the danger starts, thus incentivizing people to hurl themselves into danger. But also encouraging them to make permanent expenditures as soon as they hit 5 in a particular SA, so that they don't waste any increases. That said, I've occasionally had situations where an SA was relevant but the danger wasn't really mortal\u2014in those cases I've generally allowed the SA dice to add to the pool but not increased the SA. Also, I do Skills BW-style, with an announced Obstacle and failure consequence.<br/><br/>As an aside, I also wrote a complete set of house-rules, in addition to the above implementations, when I attempted to use TRoS to run Highlander. The game floundered due mostly to scheduling and partly to some social contract issues, but I was happy with my rules changes. Let me know if you want me to post them.<br/><br/>Matt                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_402949">\n<div class="Comment">\n<span id="latest"></span> <div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402949/#Comment_402949" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-07T17:15:03+00:00" title="January  7, 2013  5:15PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/27904663/TRoB%20_Rough_Rough_Draft_Unedited%20by%20Judd%20Karlman.pdf" rel="nofollow">The Riddle of Blood</a>, a rough draft of an unfinished setting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405321">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405321/#Comment_405321" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-03T00:43:45+00:00" title="February  3, 2013 12:43AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd think, given that you get a SA point if you pursue your SA whether you win or fail at it, that you get it once you win or fail.<br/><br/>In a way it's almost better to just leave it up to the player to declare they are pursuing an SA. It really comes down to fiction and just assuming that when such is the case you have players who care about fiction, then they are only going to declare their pursuit of the SA when it fits (as far as they can tell in their role as a co-author)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
