I'm still getting used to the style of GMing it requires and so planned a bit more cautiously than the game text suggests, not really equipping myself well to hammer the players.  However, the session still went really well and I feel more comfortable now and will be more confidently able to lay the smackdown next session.<br/><br/>I'm going to post my planning notes first and then talk a bit more about what actually happened later (as I get time between working), because I feel like it might be helpful for other folks who are running or thinking about running it.<br/><br/>On Wed evening and the few hours before folks arrived last night (Thurs), I wrote the following:\n<blockquote>Gwendolyn, the current Matriarch of the Mouse Guard, came to authority when Eleanor, the former Matriarch, died of a sudden illness.  She is the youngest Matriarch ever and, until recently, was largely supported (some say \u201crestricted\u201d) by the old warhorse advisors that were installed by Eleanor.<br/><br/>The Winter War of 1149, in which an army of weasels assaulted the western outskirts of Mouse Territories, tested Gwendolyn strongly.  The Guard, not large enough to serve as an army, instead served a leadership and coordination role with militias from various settlements. They prevailed, but at the cost of losing three western settlements, Ferndale, Woodruff\u2019s Grove, and Walnutpeck.<br/><br/>Starting just over three years later, in Spring 1153.<br/>What were you up to in the Fall 1152 (were you already a patrol then)?<br/>Where did you camp for the Winter (Lockhaven or somewhere further west, preferably)?<br/><br/>Make a Circles roll (Ob 4) to learn true information about what happened in Fall 1152 (Midnight\u2019s rebellion). Ob 2 if in Lockhaven.<br/><br/>\u201cLockhaven was attacked by a rebellion just last Fall, led by a former Guard named Midnight \u2013 who served in the Winter War \u2013 and his army of dissenters from Barkstone.  They dislike the way Gwendolyn is running the Guard \u2013 too lax, not showing enough strong leadership \u2013 and wanted to set Midnight up as king.\u201d<br/><br/>Mission Briefing<br/><br/>Given to them by Oliver, Gwendolyn\u2019s new Commander of Western Intelligence. He\u2019s based in Barkstone and is on his way there if it\u2019s not where you start. Circles (Ob 3) to know him or have heard about him. He executed a deserter during the Winter War and served as an intelligence officer under Matriarch Eleanor.<br/><br/>It\u2019s important that Gwendolyn root out sources of outright rebellion and unrest in the western settlements. She doesn\u2019t want to directly govern the settlements, but she can\u2019t continue to be hands off when rebel armies are marching on Lockhaven.<br/><br/>This song is indicative of the legitimacy problem the Guard has in these areas.  Gwendolyn wants your patrol to, first:<br/><br/>-\ttravel to Sprucetuck, along the road of retreat from Woodruff\u2019s Grove;<br/>-\tdeliver the mail (pick up the mailbag from Edward the Metalworker);<br/>-\tliaison with Captain Wessex, the intelligence officer assigned to Sprucetuck;<br/>-\tdiscover who is responsible for spreading <a href="http://thouandone.wordpress.com/2009/01/30/the-tragic-tale-of-caroline/" rel="nofollow">this song</a>.<br/><br/>Report back to Oliver who will provide you with further orders.  Hopefully, we will be able to sort this matter out within the borders of the territories and will not have to travels to the ruins of Woodruff\u2019s Grove or, worse, into the Darkheather itself.<br/><br/>Edward the Metalworker is making a new clasp for the mailbag.  The last one was shiny silver and was ripped off the bag by a raven who tormented the group of guardmice who delivered it here, losing half the mail in the process.  The new one is made of a dull piece of scrap copper.<br/><br/>His son Clarence is supposed to make a delivery to Sprucetuck and Edward hopes the kid can travel with the patrol through the treacherous spring weather.  Clarence has a large pack full of jangly metal objects but doesn\u2019t know strictly what\u2019s in it.  He\u2019s supposed to deliver it to Jacob the Glassblower, so he assumes it\u2019s glassblowing equipment.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_191382">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191382/#Comment_191382" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-06T08:21:04+00:00" title="February  6, 2009  8:21AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Weather/Journey Extended Obstacle on the way to Sprucetuck!  Spring 6.<br/>Along the way, Clarence\u2019s pack spills, revealing a bag full of round copper pins marked with the letters \u201cCL.\u201d  For Clarence?  He begins wearing one.<br/><br/>Hollow tree full of weighted elevators. Clarence goes to deliver the pins?<br/><br/>Inside the tree, the group encounters some mice wearing the \u201cCL\u201d pins.  They might mistake Clarence for one of them?  \u201cAh, so you\u2019ve pledged yourself to the League, I see!  Congratulations!\u201d  If confronted, they attempt to flee the guard.  Chase? Fight?<br/><br/>The local guard leader is Captain Wessex. If they come to his office, he has a \u201cCL\u201d pin on his dresser, which he claims to have been given by members of the Carolingian League, but has chosen not to wear.  Secretly, he is an active member of the League, one of its senior members. He has an assistant, Anthony, who is not a guardmouse but has served the guard since his arrival from Ferndale.<br/><br/>All Sprucetuck\u2019s bards, poets, and singers know the tale of Caroline, but they first heard it from a small mouse named Truth, the daughter of Captain Wessex.  She did not write the song, but refuses to say who did, because she promised.  If the guardsmice are harassing her, Anthony will come to her defense and admit that he wrote the song in memory of his sister, Caroline, a guardmouse from Woodruff\u2019s Grove.  He left with the other refugees while she and the rest of the guardmice covered their escape.<br/><br/>There is a League meeting that they could find out about? The League meeting is full of people who intend to gradually replace the guard, but the failure of Midnight\u2019s rebellion has caused controversy.  Direct attacks are foolish, though some members think they should attack immediately, before Gwendolyn can recover.  Others see no reasons to confront the guard if they can render them obsolete.  \u201cIt\u2019s time each settlement managed its own affairs without outsider meddling.\u201d</blockquote>\nI also stuck little sticky notes throughout the book, marking the extended conflict rules, the pages with stats for various mice, the animal stats (just in case I needed a twist and wanted a fight), and a few other things of note.<br/><br/>Then the players arrived and we started!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_191383">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191383/#Comment_191383" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-06T08:25:35+00:00" title="February  6, 2009  8:25AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 6, 2009 8:29AM by J_Walton.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, "the song" mentioned in the mission instructions above is the ballad of Caroline, which <a href="http://thouandone.wordpress.com/2009/01/30/the-tragic-tale-of-caroline/" rel="nofollow">I posted earlier</a> and had sent to the players by email.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
