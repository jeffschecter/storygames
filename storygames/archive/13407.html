something that "looked cool" at the store, buy it, and then never really find a use for it.  Maybe it was a crappy product, maybe it was just something that didn't click with my friends and therefore never could be played.  Sometimes it was an okay book, but cost too much for what use I got out of it (back then, $30 was a hell of a lot of cash for a twelve-year-old to be spending in one shot, and it was a very rare product that could deliver enough value to match up to that).<br/><br/>As I got older, I started thinking more about things before buying them, doing some research to find out more, and then asking myself the tough questions ("Is this actually worth $XX to me?").  And the weird thing is, it feels <i>good</i> to not buy things.  Every time I weigh a potential purchase and decide that no, I don't really want it that much, it makes me happy.  (So basically, I'm killing the RPG industry but I'm feeling good about it.)<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>- theme-song from old american movie</blockquote>\n(That's "The Order of Death" by Public Image Ltd.; I wish I could tell you which movie used it as a theme, but it got used all over the damn place in the late '80s and early '90s.

There are three primary things that I want in a RPG.  I want to be inspired by new ideas.  I usually am.  I want to support the author to continue their work.  I assume my purchase does that.  I want to play new games.  This happens least of the three, but often enough that it's all good.<br/><br/>If I feel cheated it's because the game or author stinks or some weird social thing.  It's really quite rare.  I don't usually feel cheated even if I never play the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_302823">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302823/#Comment_302823" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-01T10:58:35+00:00" title="December  1, 2010 10:58AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>When buying role-playing games;<br/>- how often do you get what you want?<br/>- how often do you feel cheated?<br/><br/>If you feel cheated;<br/>- is it due to yourself being unable to make the game work?<br/>- or is the game unable to make you work?<br/></blockquote>\nCheated is too strong a word, but I feel disappointed regularly.  <br/><br/>Sometimes it's due to a mismatch between my tastes and the rules, sometimes the rules as written aren't really functional without a parallel oral tradition that I'm not privy to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/john" title="john"><img alt="john" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/john">john</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302837/#Comment_302837" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-01T11:39:07+00:00" title="December  1, 2010 11:39AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I buy a role-playing game, what I want is two-fold:\n<ul>\n<li>The primary thing I try to accomplish with my purchases now is to support voices that bring something exciting to the culture.</li>\n<li>Very much in second place, I'm trying to find something for my own use.</li>\n</ul>\nI have enough resources now (games, novels, imaginative friends) to provide entertainment for the foreseeable future.

However, I find that as I am better about not buying things I find more joy in weighing the decision.

Neither the PDF or the CD, of course, but the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">content</span> of it is.<br/><br/>What we really buy is the content; the right to play this music or game again and again, and to have it enrich our lives.
