I want to make as much procedures as I can a part of the game instead of just boring bookkeeping needed to play the game. <br/><br/>I do value prep, but I'm tired of being an slave to it and the gamestyle I'm looking for relies less on it and more on achieving the same effects on the table through more effective-less complicated procedures. The frame of mind needed for this gameplay considers the fiction as a rigid thing only after it's been established in the game, through explicit framing or implicit in the use of elements that define it. The reason for this is that content is susceptible to improvement, and that this improvement can happen at any time, specially at the last moment. Also, ideas to improve the game content can either come from the GM or the players, so implementing the best idea in order to improve the quality of the fictional content is one of the main priorities of this gaming style.<br/><br/>One caveat to this is that this must be done unobtrusively to prevent breaking the immersion, as well as blank page syndrome or analysis paralysis. The resulting gameplay is meant to be fast, barely losing momentum, except when narration requires a different pacing -which can be easily controlled by the GM.<br/><br/>Reduced and clear bookkeeping and pre/post-game communication is what allows the system to remain fair. Once rules and roles are established players can focus on the game, which in turn focuses more on the clash between PCs and NPCs (there's meant to be as much PvE as PvP)<br/><br/>However more than just a conflict defined and resolved around numbers, tactics and dice rolls, I would like to set a couple of lines in the setting/character generation part of the game, that could help players have a more clear view of their characters in a dramatic sense. This is where things like Motivation, Objective and Relationships and maybe one more or less thing should be doing the work of Alignment in other games, but in a way that could consistently produce interesting and important conflicts.<br/><br/>In hacking terms, I believe what I'm looking for is somewhere between the setup process in Hillfolk, fiasco's setup, Tenra Bansho's Emotion Matrix and some mechanics used in japanese RPGs.<br/><br/>First part of the puzzle came from the gameplay of a hacked version of microscope we used on a campaign hiatus to define a mysterious past event in the campaign. Instead of prepping everything of that event, we played to find what had happened. It was risky, I didn't knew how it would work and barely prepped a couple things. Everyone played a king from the ancient past, was able to come up with and use all kinds of wonderful advanced technologies and the only limitation I gave them came in the shape of a card that introduced a limitation for the character's modus operandi. I already described this <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/462533/#Comment_462533" rel="nofollow">in this thread</a>, but here are the limits established again:<br/><br/>-I can agree or support anything, but my people comes first.<br/>-I'll say anything that need to be said, but that doesn't mean I will stick to it.<br/>-Peace needs to be upheld at any cost<br/>-Knowledge comes first<br/>-People comes first, except those that don't value people's life.<br/>-Efficiency is everything<br/>-I'll support anyone that gives me actual benefits<br/>-The future comes first, sacrifices must be made.<br/>-I'll shoulder this but you better never forget what I did<br/><br/>These are geared towards a sort of "controlled conflict". They don't pit PCs against each other, but makes their immediate collaboration and full agreement harder and not exempt of consequences, even if things go well. So this is more of less what I'm aiming for.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462955/#Comment_462955" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-04T23:01:29+00:00" title="May  4, 2017 11:01PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tenra Bansho's Emotion Matrix is as I mentioned, a great influence too. Here, whenever two characters meet, the table generates a random emotion and it's up to the players to impro and find out what's behind the characters relationship, how those feelings came to be. <br/><br/>In Shinobigami your character is usually choosing between fulfilling their clan goal, personal agenda or sticking with their friends, who have the same internal conflicts.<br/><br/>I like Hillfolk's relationship map and character having two poles is closer to what I'm looking in some ways. The examples are good, but if players are left to come up with their own it requires certain degree of player skill to recognize good conflict starters from poor ones. I get the petitioner-granter procedure, but it doesn't click anything for me, I mean, we're used to talk things out as a group. We only resort to dice rolling for either less important conflicts or when important conflicts reach a blocking point without scaling or getting interrupted. Even when dice are rolled, now for us it works as a recurrent joke: two characters argue and there seems to be no solution in sight. A text appears on screen "two hours later", and then they are both the best friends ever, nobody knows what happened.<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462957/#Comment_462957" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-04T23:08:04+00:00" title="May  4, 2017 11:08PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've had great results with petitioner / granter for PC vs NPC.

There are a lot of ways to do what you are asking, but the question is what is the right way for <i>your</i> game? I think in order to give you good suggestions regarding the procedures that would work best and be most elegant, I would need to know more about the type of game you designed.  Without that information it's extremely difficult to give you anything useful, even if you know what you want is an amalgamation of some other games for your "controled" inter-player conflict\u2014BTW, did you mean inter-character conflict, by chance?\u2014I know providing those details however is no easy task, even a brief overview regarding how it works mechanically and procedurally might help some.

I'm sorta in the way but to finally make decisions about any design writing and sharing works wonders.<br/><br/>Sandra, we actually do petitioner-granter, it's just that we learned to do that organically following our instinct and a few lucky lessons from other GMs here. So, no need to add rules to do what we already do. Funny thing is that we just prompt this with the usual question "Ok, so you want to convince this guy of doing X. How do you do it, what do you say to him?". Natural conversation ensues, GM keeps in character and answers accordingly. If the GM were to focus on a procedure over this IC exchange both the performance and the mechanic solution will suffer (I know, I tried, I can't definitely play two games at once)<br/><br/>Rolling the dice for social stuff works more like an additional mechanic, one that sees use only when the GM realizes the NPC is in doubt and the conversation has reached its best moment (PCs and NPCs have stated their arguments, negotiation reaches blockpoint, everyone is looking at the silent GM showing expectation, etc) . If there's no doubt either for good or bad, GM roleplays ahead. Players may comment out of character whatever they think it happened, then the GM adds some brief explanations if needed. Our procedure here it's been so clear through the ages that no other mechanic for negotiation has ever clicked with us.<br/><br/>Thanks Jeff. I'll try to be as clear about the goals of this design and the things that took me to those goals as much as I can. This begun with us trying to play Anima Beyond Fantasy, an spanish streamlined hack of Rolemaster geared to reproduce a Final Fantasy like experience. As it was cumbersome and incomplete we started to hack it and made a different versions of it each campaign we played. It saw Fate-like implementations some of which kinda stuck, got revamped when we found out Tenra Bansho and a bit more when I finally got what was PbtA all about. I had readed a few player aids for Dungeon World and World of Dungeons and fell in love with how efficient and organic was the gameplay just by having the GM change his frame of mind a bit about when should things happen.<br/><br/>On the prep side, I got burned as a GM after the second campaign, because I didn't had enough time, had to prep way too much and relied a lot on rails and illusionism. I felt the diversity of my content was lacking and so I finished a quite broken version of the system and handled the GM seat to a friend of mine. We had a blast with his campaign, though it was mostly because the system was so broken that player agency skyrocketed and the GM had a really hard time coming up with true effective challenges. It was then however that we made our best memories about the game.<br/><br/>I returned renewed for the fourth campaign trying a more sandbox-with fronts approach, but still found out the prep to be too much at some times. So I tried all kind of random generators to fill in for stuff. I used a sad excuse of a big randomly generated dungeon at some point and filled the blanks in some of the rooms with whatever lore I could come up at the moment. In one of those rooms the players started joking about the dungeon builders and said that they should make their own religious cult. <br/><br/>I had an epiphany then and asked how would they do that. We didn't finish that dungeon, I followed them as they created their cult and improvised some rules about how they convinced people and managed their training. It worked wonders for the campaign. The second highest point was when I finally had to come up with the explanation about the mysterious past of the world and how it came to be. I couldn't come up with something so amazing as the things we had experienced already, but I trusted the players once and it was fantastic, why couldn't I trust them for this too? So we used a bit of Microscope for that on the way I mentioned above. Everything clicked perfectly, and the campaign ended on one of the best scenes we could recall, with one of the players, Nico, nuking the whole setting on a whim, because he thought they wouldn't win the final battle. They did. Up to this date we call that event "The Nicocalypse"<br/><br/>After that came the failed fifth campaign. I came up with a Tenra-Bansho hack that incorporated a few things familiar for the players and some new ones from Tenra and other games. One of the players opted out of the game and I ended up feeling the group was tired of my experiments and there was more interest on playing other stuff, so I dropped the campaign. I wrote a bit about that experience <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/19223/tenra-bansho-anima-hack-a-piece-of-advice-for-game-designers-hackers-in-general#latest" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/><br/>One of the players died two years ago. In his honor, Nico took again the GM duties and used a system another friend had come up with. It was nice, though he wasn't at his best and the system still had a couple of issues. But this triggered a conversation with the player that had opted out of the fifth campaing. It turned out it wasn't my fault or the system nor lack of interest. He had realized in the meantime that what he couldn't stand was some of the japanese gore aspects of the Tenra hack. I removed most of it, but I had kept the samurai who got supernatural abilities by engraving gems on their skin. That was what turned him off, though he didn't knew it was because of a phobia and only came to realize it years later.<br/><br/>It wasn't until this conversation that they told me that they actually liked the system! I was still unsatisfied due to some of the things posted on that thread, so I went back to the design table and tried something in another direction, enhancing the things players liked the most about all the system iterations.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463008">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463008/#Comment_463008" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-05T19:52:25+00:00" title="May  5, 2017  7:52PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 5, 2017 8:51PM by WarriorMonk.">edited May 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            About full PbtA, hmmm well, custom moves still feel a bit too rigid for us. I'm using a couple core mechanics from PbtA and that's enough to reproduce all we want from that system anyway. And players still want the d100 and high numbers from the original AbF.<br/><br/>So basically It's mostly a power fantasy, characters die when players decide because the ultimate gamble to get what you want in the fiction is to bet your control over the character, but you can fold at any time before that. Characters are OP, combat is fast, the GM doesn't need to actually prep too much but each thing prepped adds quality to the game. Everything is geared to take off creative pressure from both the GM and the players, but still relying on collaborative efforts to build the fiction and fill the blanks. <br/><br/>There are lots of blanks players can fill through any scene but instead of being asked to do so and make up something very specific, players are confronted with small creative limits, challenges, choices and random tables where connecting the dots creates content. And there is more than one way to connect two of those dots and the chance to pile up as many connections as you like. No blank page syndrome, no downtime, no prep, no bookkeeping, no stress, no demands, no long-term commitment, just us and the game.<br/><br/>Edit: almost forgot this, you're partially right Jeff, the procedure at the setup is meant to generate inter-character conflict, but as we tested on the Tenra-Hack Campaign, since players are able to pick up and play NPCs whenever there isn't any reason for their characters to be present on a scene, the inter-character conflict translates to the NPC. It's still under control there, NPCs never come into an scene without a predefined motivation, emotion and/or objective, but that doesn't mean players go easy on each other. most of these NPCs usually have the short stick due to game mechanics, so it takes player ingenuity to turn these little pieces of agency into interesting challenges or surprising story twists. At least is great to see how even the most simple NPC gets a lot of color.<br/><br/>Somehow its quite GMfull where needed, still nobody knows what's going to happen and yet it keeps coherence!<br/><br/>About the things we're keeping from Fate, it's mostly about<br/><br/>-Open skill list. While we are porting stuff from previous games, players are welcome to come up with stuff on their own. Due to the "nothing is an automatic sucess unless the challenge is too easy" principle used by the game, even the seemingly most unbalanced skills can be brought into the game and used, and they remain balanced against ordinary skills. After all in a true anime setting the Master Thief can steal even from the Avatar of the True Sight. Or at least he can try.<br/><br/>-Invoking and Compelling aspects hmm, maybe just for the motivations and objectives. It's just that sometimes players break coherence a bit when they act against the character's guidelines, like alignment and such. Sometimes they start deliberately assigning limits that leave them free to not interact with the situations neither for good or bad. While I understand this fear of compromise to a single way of action, this usually just makes it harder for most conflicts to happen, until they are forced upon the characters. While remembering players to act according to their alignment do works, it keeps feeling a bit artificial and doesn't make for a fun mechanic. However, negotiating this works a bit better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
