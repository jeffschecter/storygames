But indie games often are really tightly wedded to their premise, and don't leave a lot of room for that.  <br/><br/>Strangely, I think some traditional games, like Savage Worlds, do this, but they don't do it well.  For example, "hey, you're in a modern setting?  here's the rules for guns and vehicles."  <br/><br/>What I wish indie games had was "Hey, you guys have a hard time visualising the scene?  Have a hard time adding details?  Want to reward players who take on adversarial roles?  Want to emphasize some thematic point?"  That kind of thing, in the indie sphere, tends to be relegated to when you choose the game, not when you've decided you like a game.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175914">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175914/#Comment_175914" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-23T08:59:32+00:00" title="October 23, 2008  8:59AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are a few games that do this to a degree for me but not quite as modular as you are thinking.<br/><br/>Defining what Sorcerers, Demons and Sorcerous Rituals in Sorcerer but there are also modular bits in the supplements that allow setting building in delicious ways.<br/><br/>The way Burning Wheel, particularly in the Monster and Magic Burners allow for custom monsters, lifepaths, traits and emotional attributes.<br/><br/>There are more but those two come to mind immediately, probably because they are my two favorite games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_175917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175917/#Comment_175917" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-23T09:07:52+00:00" title="October 23, 2008  9:07AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Judd beat me to it!

Thing about it is that it's quite hard to actually implement, and requires the designer to be less of an author and more of just another guy involved in the dialog of the game. (Which is also where a lot of trad games fail, they don't actually talk with the group, they just talk to an assumed standard.) <br/><br/>Judd, <br/><br/>True that.

We just haven't seen as many of them yet.  I've been thinking some about this on my blog:<br/><br/>- <a href="http://thouandone.wordpress.com/2008/07/18/rules-for-generating-rules/" rel="nofollow">Rules for Generating Rules</a><br/>- <a href="http://thouandone.wordpress.com/2008/07/18/evolving-interaction-methods/" rel="nofollow">Evolving Interaction Methods</a><br/>- <a href="http://thouandone.wordpress.com/2008/09/29/they-will-play-your-game-wrong/" rel="nofollow">They Will Play Your Game Wrong</a><br/><br/>Honestly, I think we already have games that point the way in other fashions. The way setting gets collaboratively created or customized in PTA or Bliss Stage is pretty dern awesome.  We just need to figure out how to do the same thing with system, allowing folks to trick out their game engine and social contract before play begins.  Difficult, perhaps, but only because we're not used to doing it, I suspect.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175922">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175922/#Comment_175922" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-23T09:23:10+00:00" title="October 23, 2008  9:23AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite><br/><br/>Judd,<br/><br/>True that.

(For comparison, imagine a version of D&amp;D where you had to sit down with your friends and build classes and Feat trees before playing. It would probably be almost impossible to make that easy to do, but it would certainly make the game feel more "customizable".) <br/><br/>It might work the other way, as well: games that are less "coherent" (I'm using the term to mean 'focused on a specific playstyle or Creative Agenda') might <i>need</i> more customization to make them work for a particular group. Therefore, of course games like GURPS or Fudge or HERO or whatever are going to have lots of modular options available--many groups will need those options to make the game work for them.<br/><br/>I also agree with Filip: I'd like the game to take me 100% of the way there. But I also like it if the game includes some optional tidbits that give some other ways to play the game. Maybe long-term play of your particular game is better with an additional mechanic that you don't need in one-shots, for example (or vice-versa). For games that require a lot of development before playing, how about two or three "default sets"? Etc.<br/><br/>But the design of many "indie" games is often so carefully calibrated (at least in theory) that designing in options that work with what is there is impossible, incredibly difficult, or not worth the trouble. <br/><br/>Now, for some rhetorical questions (woo! My favourite!):<br/><br/>When you play a game like chess, tested over centuries, do you really need some "optional/modular rules"?<br/><br/>Do optional/modular rules suggest imperfection in design?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175939">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175939/#Comment_175939" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-23T11:48:19+00:00" title="October 23, 2008 11:48AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Now, for some rhetorical questions (woo!

As the largest example, one Toggle (World v Player Priority) dictates who can kill a character--anyone that can land a Killing Blow or ONLY the player of the character (albeit somewhat indirectly--the latter case still needs some opponent to do full damage to kill the player, barring suicides).<br/><br/>I'm just sayin'.

It is the whole hobby. There is nothing in the hobby that is not customization. All play is house ruling.  And so it is baffling to me that so little attention has been given to it. Everyone waves their hand at it. "Oh, that's a house rule, we can't discuss THAT, we can only discuss the GAME." As if any line that could be drawn between them would be useful to play at all.<br/><br/>All play is house ruling. All play is customization.  A game that takes you "100% of the way" is by definition unplayable - it is complete - it does not require you - it excludes what you wish to do - there is no room for you at the table - there is no food upon which you may sup.<br/><br/>The first attention given to customization beyond "hey if you want to change this, feel free, hurrrrrrr", which is not helpful at all in determining what you should change, how you should change it, what you should change it to, and what effects that will have that I can recall was in Vampire 1ed, in which significant chunks of GM advice were dedicated to establishing and reinforcing a Tone of your own devising.  As small as this assistance was, it was frankly made of platinum-plated fuckyeah for all that it helped me avoid many of the pitfalls that others who missed that assistance had.<br/><br/>The 3.0 DMG, for all its detail, had a lot of customization points as well.  "Hey, check out how you can make this a sort of India-theme fantasy game, hey, if you want to do it this way, you can do it this way..."<br/><br/>nWoD has an enormous number of points like this.<br/><br/>GURPS has done it a long time, probably even longer than Vampire (although I didn't know it back then.)<br/><br/>But really, for the most part - even in all these examples - customization opportunities are just sort of put out there assuming that you know what you want to do and just need some brainstorming permission.  That is not where the hard work of customizing is. Ideas are a dime a dozen. The hard part is implementation, getting the idea into play.  Hardly any game, "Trad" or "Indie" or "story" or whatever, does that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_175954">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175954/#Comment_175954" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-23T13:59:04+00:00" title="October 23, 2008  1:59PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite> Everyone waves their hand at it.

ANSI C doesn't define x++ as anything, either, but I am clearly not extending or customizing the language by using an existing operator in such a way.

It is not a game. A game that is 100% complete from the rules perspective can (and will) be played in any way the players want to, as long as they follow the rules as intended.

How about play possibilities (strategies, color, custom settings, characters, powers...)?<br/><br/>And the thing is that with games not as "simple" and direct as Chess, there is no 100% complete rules. If only because everyone will interpret the rules as they see them, and there is no way two people can understand something that complete and complicated in a 100%.

(Message baords, Hacks , etc)<br/><br/>As to wade into the murky depth of what a game is, <br/><br/>I think a game can be 100% complete in its rules and in its play, and I don't think that a game that is 100% complete in rule and play (or concept and execution) is for some reason reduced to a series of immutible steps (which is not very play like). International Federation of  Chess while it still has room for ' improvisation' is clearly only within the rules, a pawn will NEVER do anything that is not expressly allowed, No piece ever will. Every possible legal move has been found, and if we wanted to we could compute every possible game (if you want to argue the point, lets consider checkers instead), and while there is still discussion over which is best, there are no new moves.<br/><br/>I think your despairing over deriving infinite play from finite rules, a task which is both doable (in a mathematic sense) and pragmatically possible (threw the things like context and interaction  ). This of this more in terms of language, we have a pretty finite number of words and stuff to use, but even if it was finitie of this moment, (no new words or change , ever) we could still derive infinite statements I see, I see that I see, I see that I see that I see, I see that I see that I see  that I see, etc. <br/><br/>Just my 2 copper<br/><br/>Logos                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
