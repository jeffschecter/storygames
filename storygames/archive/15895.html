So I was wondering what you think are the essential components to a good (concerning) goblin?<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I\u2019m not such a fan of making simply \u201csavage humanoid\u201d goblins, which to me just seem like bad racist caricatures of non industrial human societies. For me a good goblin is summed up by being \u201cgreebly\u201d. What does greebly mean you may ask? I\u2019m not sure myself, but I am certain that goblins are greebly, and the more greebly, the better.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are your thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_360924">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360924/#Comment_360924" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-20T17:34:49+00:00" title="February 20, 2012  5:34PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Goblins are short, like halflings.

They have no aptitude for magic or war or animal husbandry. They love fire, and worked metal of all sorts, and gems and gold.

They unpredictable in that they will one moment be craven, cagey, and/or cowardly, but the next moment throw themselves into danger with a disturbingly child-like glee.<br/><br/>Unlike their cousins, the elves, they embraced steel and learned to shape it, specializing in contraptions and machines that aren't particularly safe or aesthetically pleasing, but are certainly effective.

They tend to last weeks (often dying in battle or in accidents) and they become considered elders if they survive months. In the course of their lives, they might sire a few litters of a dozen or more children. <br/><br/>Some few goblins have managed to find magical artifacts that prolong their lifespans to years, they are considered virtually immortals by the hordes around them. Such goblins become heroes to their people.<br/><br/>Decades ago (or more), goblins stole a human child and convinced it to be their king; this is why the goblin king looks nothing like the goblin hordes. Because he lives so much longer than them, they were able to convince him that he lives forever. He exists as a figurehead, only fed information by a cabal of bickering goblin courtesans.<br/><br/>I could easily write more on this topic, but I've already written 160 pages in the companion book referenced above.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_360960">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/otherdoc" title="otherdoc"><img alt="otherdoc" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://otherdoc.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/jimsquared32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/otherdoc">otherdoc</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360960/#Comment_360960" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-20T20:43:08+00:00" title="February 20, 2012  8:43PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've always liked the idea that goblins can make things explode.

On one hand (my more biological er hand), I think of goblins as hyper aggressive, flappy eared, magpie like, slightly green chimpanzees. Not quite intelligent to make their own complex tools, they're more than happy (and sneaky) enough to steal them. Unlike chimpanzees, they breed fast and have the physiological capacity to speak a simple chittering language.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, I approach them as more feyish - a physical manifestation of vindictive bad luck. This is more in line with Simon C's suggestion that goblins come from discarded semen (which I think is an excellent idea). A merchant's roof collapses on her, and everyone thinks its bad luck. However, children playing near the site swear they can see tiny saw marks on the timber, and hear chittering laughter coming from near-by houses. Villagers talk that at twilight, squat figures dart in alleyways.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_360996">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360996/#Comment_360996" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-20T23:57:53+00:00" title="February 20, 2012 11:57PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Goblins are a lot like sharks.

They can be defeated in combat, however, and if so, they will not return until the place has seen 111 years of straight darkness.

Things got really complicated when they started working for Edison; their gremlin cousins just couldn't seem to resist messing with everything - especially vehicles. The goblins were blamed for a lot of it and ended up working in postal and telegraph offices trying to eek out a living. It was a tough time and very unlike the good old days when you could just kidnap children and ransom them. Or possibly eat them - the sources are unclear on this point. Of course, things got better over time and they found newer and stranger technology to bend in directions they were probably never meant to go, whether for good or ill. The fruits of their labor often resulted in explosions - lots of explosions.<br/><br/>That's all in the past, though. From what I understand, nowadays most of them work for Microsoft.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_361506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Blurry" title="Blurry"><img alt="Blurry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Blurry">Blurry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361506/#Comment_361506" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-22T21:24:26+00:00" title="February 22, 2012  9:24PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Goblins are seemingly unaware of the limitations of their size and behave as if they were twice as big and strong as they really are. They are also blissfully unaware of the trouble that such behavior can bring.<br/><br/>Goblins see themselves as brave adventurers. Unfortunately the "adventure" they seek is usually perceived by others as "mischief," "thievery," or "reckless self-endangerment."<br/><br/>There is a widespread belief that goblins are motivated by a love of gold. The truth is, it is the acquisition of gold that goblins love, through anything but legitimate means. Needlessly complicated schemes are to goblins what mining is to the dwarves.
