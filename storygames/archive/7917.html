It's full of ideas that go directly against a lot of modern game design, yet really struck home for me. It's got these four "Zen Moments:"</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Rulings, not Rules</li>\n<li>Player Skill, not Character Abilities</li>\n<li>Heroic, not Superhero</li>\n<li>Forget "Game Balance"</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I dig this paragraph:</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>Most of the time in old-style gaming, you don\u2019t use a rule; you make a ruling.  It\u2019s easy</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>to understand that sentence, but it takes a flash of insight to really \u201cget it.\u201d  The players <br/>\ncan describe any action, without needing to look at a character sheet to see if they \u201ccan\u201d <br/>\ndo it.  The referee, in turn, uses common sense to decide what happens or rolls a die if he <br/>\nthinks there\u2019s some random element involved, and then the game moves on.  This is why <br/>\ncharacters have so few numbers on the character sheet, and why they have so few <br/>\nspecified abilities.</p>\n<p>When I first read this, I cringed, thinking about the idea of hard GM fiat. Reading it again, though, I realized it's kind of player-empowering. The people I play with are cool, and we don't screw each other over. I'd trust any of them to be the arbitrator for an in-game event, and in reality, we do this every week. If looking up a rule is taking too long or is boring, we skip it and use an extrapolation from the rules we do know.</p>\n<p>Something about this pamphlet scratched an itch I'd been having a lot recently. I'd be curious to know what your reaction to it is.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175294">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175294/#Comment_175294" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-17T09:25:05+00:00" title="October 17, 2008  9:25AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm going to point again to the idea that players at different ages ( say prime rpger age  of 12-22 versus older gamers of 28+) react differently to this concept (GM Fiat/Rulings).<br/><br/>I realize that the issue is much more complex than a simple one of age, but I really see a clustering of GM Fiat Issues around the younger age group that simply aren't there with the older group, or at least not in anything like the same numbers or the same intensity when clashes occur.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_175295">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175295/#Comment_175295" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-17T09:25:09+00:00" title="October 17, 2008  9:25AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I liked it when I read it some time back. I've for a long time been a big fan of many of the things the author identifies as typical of old-school gaming. I raved about this stuff in my blog last winter a bit, and now I'm running a D&amp;D campaign of sorts that works pretty much like this. Old modes of adventure gaming have lots to teach us here in the modernity, as long as somebody takes the time to actively look and see what they can adapt and really verbalize from the murky accounts of yesteryear.<br/><br/>I'd write more about individual points such as game balance, but really it <b>would</b> devolve into a demented rant against and for many things I'm passionate about in fantasy adventure rpgs. I'd rather save that stuff for my blog, where I'm not actively annoying people and "harshing the zen" as they call it here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175298">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175298/#Comment_175298" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-17T09:38:32+00:00" title="October 17, 2008  9:38AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, this isn't so much Old School as it's REALLY Old School.  From all the way back in the day.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese concepts come directly from the days when "gaming" meant historical miniatures wargames.  Even though a battle might represent 100,000 men involving 1500 lead figures (all authentically painted, of course) the rules for such a game could fit often on 1 sheet of paper (or at most a very thin pamplet.  With the data found on the army lists, you'd play...and time would pass and the referee would be regularly called upon to make a "ruling".  In tourney play veterans of the circuit would sometimes tailor their tactics based on how a particular referee typically ruled (much like pitchers will tailor their pitches to how big of a strike zone a particular umpire calls).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that was the way it was...and people liked it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo those early games were very much "here's what I do", "here's what happens" back and forth...then "Story" reared its ugly head and the desire to actually tell a story through play rather than just do stuff and see what happens.  And that's when the rules explosion happened with rules to force players to play more a certain way and then more rules to protect players from GMs and on and on until we get the cruft and baggage that today we typically think of as characterizing "Old School".<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich is why I'd call that how to play REALLY Old School.  That was Old School when Old School was still New School.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_175300">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175300/#Comment_175300" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-17T09:50:35+00:00" title="October 17, 2008  9:50AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 17, 2008 9:53AM by Brand_Robins.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The "heroic not super heroic" one is the one that rang loudest for me.

But can Gamist challenges work when the rules are somewhat arbitrary?<br/><br/>The temptation is to call this Simulationism - the idea being to heighten Exploration of a fantasy world, with the GM there to act as its physics, providing an impartial perspective on "what would actually happen". But then, that seems at odds with the idea that the player is encouraged to step on up to keep their character alive, even if this entails their low-intelligence character having sudden attacks of caution and good sense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Meserach" title="Meserach"><img alt="Meserach" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Meserach">Meserach</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175352/#Comment_175352" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-17T15:37:50+00:00" title="October 17, 2008  3:37PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            HEROIC NOT SUPERHERO<br/><br/>An aesthetic choice, this.

The key point is probably the way the players and the characters relate to the game setting; a "heroic" game is one where the players just absolutely don't have any recourse or empowerment outside of the agreed-upon immediate setting context, while I'd say that the author uses "superheroic" to mean games where the players expect to have empowering influence and presume to have their own wishes get priority over the setting of the game. In other words, a "superheroic" game tends to be one where the players win just because that's what "fun" is about, while in a heroic game you have to earn your victories. A stark contrast between the stylings often comes up when it comes to character concepts: if a player presumes that the rules and setting should bend to allow his very special half-cat half-girl character with magic moon powers to enter the game, then the player probably has a drive towards a "superheroic" game. So it's not all just aesthetics, there are systematic components to it, too.<br/><br/>Or that sort of thing, at least it's a possibility. It's been a couple of months since I read that text, so I might be projecting my own thoughts. Food for thought, anyway.<br/><br/>As for GNS, insofar as it matters, this is all clearly gamist play, no doubt about that, really. The concern heaped upon setting detail and realism and such is not a sign of simulationism, but of a keen willingness to provide and face the challenges of navigating this particular fictional situation. If anything, the willingness of the players to take the fiction seriously instead of jeopardizing it with rules-lawyering makes the gamist play work better.<br/><br/>The moose head thing (which, if memory serves, dealt with the old-school method of finding traps and secrets by careful dialogue) is something I don't do myself, either - but that's just a matter of scale, not of technique! The exact same attitude of letting the player choices influence events are pretty prevalent in my current D&amp;D campaign. For me in this space it's important that there is genuine communication of challenges and responses at the table, though - an old-school GM is often presented as laughing merrily as his subtle hints and warnings fly over the heads of players who prepare to do something that'll kill their characters, but I don't really see much point in that; for the game situation to work for me, there has to be explicit recognition of challenge on the player level, followed by efforts and either failure or victory. Just having the characters fail in something without the players even realizing that it's a challenge in the first place is pointless. So that's why I only do the moose head thing after making sure that the players realize that they're making a strategic choice by <i>not</i> searching a room with a comb. For example, if the characters know that there is a treasure somewhere in the area, but also are limited in time, then the moose head stuff is doable - the players need to balance the needs of doing the search with their time management, and there are grounds for conflict. Even then I wouldn't probably do a pure dialogue-based resolution, but rather a full-blown conflict resolution set up by that dialogue - if a player can just point out and say where the treasure is hidden, then that's that, but otherwise we'll have some descriptions of search technique, time spent and other constraints and then do some skill checks or whatever to find out if the characters are in luck. But that's all up to the dialogue with the players, as it's their choice how and what the characters do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_175376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noisms" title="noisms"><img alt="noisms" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.dragonsfoot.org/forums/download/file.php?avatar=7881_1233713790.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noisms">noisms</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175376/#Comment_175376" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-18T00:52:17+00:00" title="October 18, 2008 12:52AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Who cares whether it's 'Gamist' or not?

Both pretty much use the same tools, but if everyone has access to those tools (and it's not just the GM doing the "ruling" ) then it's harder to be a tyrant.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_175412">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noisms" title="noisms"><img alt="noisms" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.dragonsfoot.org/forums/download/file.php?avatar=7881_1233713790.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noisms">noisms</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175412/#Comment_175412" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-18T21:56:02+00:00" title="October 18, 2008  9:56PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I came across as more snippy than I meant to!

It's that the system is (1) almost entirely drama resolution based on the GM's world-model, and (2) initially totally obscured from the players, who must learn it through experimentation and research. While there is an appeal to "realistic", "common sense", "logical consequences" as principle, in practice these are contested things, often based more on "whatever the GM read this week" than anything objective.<br/><br/>This can be a very smooth, fun, challenging kind of play, particularly if what you like is puzzle-solving. Done right, it's almost purely matching wits with the GM. It usually only gets that way once a group has gone through a long process of getting onto the same wavelength - or when they already have strongly convergent ideas about what is "realistic", "fair", and "fun."<br/><br/>I think that proponents of this style seriously underestimate the difficulties involved in getting reliable fun out of this method with anything other than a long-established or culturally homogenous group. On the other hand, proponents of rules-exposed (but still player-challenge-focused) games probably underestimate how the difficulty of getting lasting fun out of a closed system unless it is exactly aimed at your specific tastes &amp; assumptions already.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_175497">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175497/#Comment_175497" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-19T19:10:50+00:00" title="October 19, 2008  7:10PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But, I don't always want to do things the way the GM thinks they should be done.<br/><br/>In fact, I often don't want to do things the way the GM thinks they should be done.<br/>Which goes back to the need for a long-established, culturally homogenized group.<br/><br/>And brings up the point: if everyone can contribute to the setting or components of "common sense" which the GM uses to make rulings, then you've got a lot better chance of having a system which focuses on your specific tastes and assumptions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noisms" title="noisms"><img alt="noisms" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.dragonsfoot.org/forums/download/file.php?avatar=7881_1233713790.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noisms">noisms</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175500/#Comment_175500" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-19T20:02:54+00:00" title="October 19, 2008  8:02PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I think there's also the fact that such a GM is not as "above the law" as one would think.

Later in the week I will. Still, all this talk about hidden assumptions and being a good GM in some sort of transcending-the-system way is not correlating with my fresh experiences - when I do this stuff nowadays, I'm in constant meta-dialogue with the players about what they see and understand going on in the game, and I certainly feel constrained by a sort of system that I'm slowly starting to be able to verbalize. Perhaps something will come of that when I've played long enough. For example, in yesterday's session, I actually had this whole moose-head thing: the characters went into the dungeon, mapped what little of it they could reach and determined that they had no idea how to proceed further inside. The characters were a bit stumped, but the <i>players</i>, being in constant communication with me, never had any frustration, as they realized that this was a spot where they were supposed to pay attention and start trying different things. I don't off-hand remember if I said explicitly that this was a puzzle challenge event, but I think that the players realized it from the body language and the fact that I required lots of perception checks as I fed them snippets of description about the environment.<br/><br/>I also disagree about the need to gain a particularly high degree of group coherence before this sort of games can make sense; this campaign of which we played the fourth session yesterday is actually a pick-up game in which the players (and characters) change each and every session. So far we've had... nine different players play it, with a different composition to the group every time. Half of these players have been newbies who haven't ever played rpgs before, while another half have been playing story games for years; I think we have one player who's played a lot of D&amp;D apart from myself.<br/><br/>But, while I think that my campaign just happens to be an excellent comparison for this discussion, I'd better desist from this until I have the time to write about it for real.

She was playing an elf, and so she was a spellcaster. The characters were entering a crypt and wanted to sense if there was any magic around. There's a spell for that - Detect Magic - but it's pretty specific, and makes magic stuff glow. So, we've got a new player who wants more information in order to make decisions, and a basic system framework which doesn't prohibit getting a weird feeling, but does have a Wisdom stat. So, I tell her to make a Wisdom check (with my own stat check system that I made up on the fly); she makes it; and I tell her that she gets a creepy feeling, like there's old malevolent magic here. This works great for us. I get to convey info; she gets info; and it's done at character level.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175532">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175532/#Comment_175532" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-20T06:41:36+00:00" title="October 20, 2008  6:41AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Hey Clinton, I've got a serious question for you.

Mostly because it sounds interesting and engaging and not dull and pointless. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite>While there is an appeal to "realistic", "common sense", "logical consequences" as principle, in practice these are contested things, often based more on "whatever the GM read this week" than anything objective.</blockquote>\nIt doesn't need to be objectively consistent. It just needs to be consistent enough for the players at the table. The main satisfaction one can get from exploring the game world is to master it, step by step. Learning and understanding the game world is what it's all about. Survival and levelling is really just proof that you know your way around the game world (and that you might have had some lucky dice rolls, too... but mainly the first bit.) It's not about figuring the GM out, but the world. And this distinction is only possible, if the GM does his part, too. <br/><br/>This means seperating the person from his position. As a person I'm of course interested in having a good time with my friends and helping them have a good time, too. (Provided I'm not socially inept and completely oblivious.) But as a GM it's my job to be dispassionate about what happens to the characters and how their players feel about it. As a GM I only answer to the game world and have to uphold its consistency. Only if I do that, can the players rely on their exploring the game world to have any value. Only then, is exploration actually fun.<br/><br/>Everything else, from dramatic storylines, three-dimensional characters to sophisticated character interplay is built on this foundation of a solid and consistent game world. Without it, exploration doesn't matter. And without exploration it's really just an abstract boardgame played with words.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175551">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175551/#Comment_175551" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-20T08:44:08+00:00" title="October 20, 2008  8:44AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This may be a tangent, but what Georgios said made me think of it. The single biggest problem I've encountered in trying to run or play in this mode is not that the GM is arbitrary or unfair. It's that the Shared Imagined Space.... isn't. Typically, this isn't a huge problem - the GM has content authority, and that's that. There is one place it repeatedly tripped us up.<br/><br/>Characters who live in the world know more about it than their players. They understand its rules and "physics" intimately. However, this knowledge is only available to the player of that character through careful questioning of the GM. However, particularly in faux-medieval or modern setting with a low degree of the fantastic, players often tend to assume that their own native intuitions about the world are accurate, and assume that their characters share them. The player, then, acts on that assumption ... without informing the GM of explicit intent, since that's usually too "meta" for this style ... only to discover, oops, "in MY world, it's different"! Sudden, severe disjoint.<br/><br/>I've run into this rift many times, on both sides of the screen, while trying to play games in this mode. The most memorable occasion involved the trustworthiness of Noldor and the dangers of associating with them - a gap in interpretation of the source material irrevocably broke the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_175560">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175560/#Comment_175560" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-20T10:08:48+00:00" title="October 20, 2008 10:08AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mark,<br/><br/>I've seen the same thing, many times.

But it's rarely the case.<br/><br/>My own experience with kind of "old school" play is something like this, both from the player's side and the GM's side:<br/><br/>--The GM presents some situation or problem, or environment.<br/>--The players try to do stuff.<br/>--Each attempt is judged by the GM, compared to some implicit standard of excellence in his or her head. <br/>--Some things are pre-determined ("if you twist the moose's head to the right, the door opens"), but most things have to be ruled on the fly by the GM ("OK, I use my Telekinesis on the moose head. Does the door open?" --well, does Telekinesis twist the head to the right or not?).<br/>--When the players' attempts to not meet the GM's "standards of excellence", they fail, and everyone must keep trying, looking for other ways to solve the problems or puzzles presented.<br/>--When players' attempts and ideas meet the GM's "standard of excellence" or "standard of creativity", they succeed. The GM gets this impressed look on his face, and describes how the secret door opens. "Ooh, clever!" The other players high-five the clever player, and everyone feels good.<br/><br/>I've seen it be a lot of fun, even for teens playing together. But it's also a bit of a potential minefield. I cringed for this reason when I read through Beast Hunters--the GM "judges" each attempt for "coolness", which determines its effectiveness in play. However, Beast Hunters has a clever twist on this, since the players can always fall back on the "default" if they don't like the GM's offer. (That is as I understand it, anyway, not having actually played the game.)<br/><br/>For instance, Eero, I can't know exactly what your game is like, but I'd love to hear how and why you feel that some kind of objective standard or system is in play in your game. Based on my experience, I would interpret your account as, "Eero is being a good, fair, creative GM, and everyone's having fun as a result." But it sounds like you have some kind of interesting system based on out-of-game discussion, which you use to align your own standards and assumptions with those the players bring to the table.<br/><br/>I'd love to see a write-up of what the actual dialogue of your process looks like at the table!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175569/#Comment_175569" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-20T11:24:27+00:00" title="October 20, 2008 11:24AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll write about our moose head experiences this week at some point. Doing it properly will take a couple of hours, not the least because I really need to think myself on what, exactly, are the ruling principles in our in-play interaction in this campaign. I seem to have figured out how to run successful old-school fantasy adventures after my <a href="http://isabout.wordpress.com/2007/11/01/challenge-based-adventuring/" rel="nofollow">challenge-based epiphany</a> last winter, but the low-level rules of interaction we follow still seem a mystery - they're the sort of thing just about anybody would recognize as normal roleplaying, but for some reason we aren't getting any of that miscommunication, GM bias or other problems listed in this thread. My gut feeling is that we have some sort of systematic procedures in place and I just haven't managed to verbalize them to myself yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_175575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175575/#Comment_175575" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-20T11:46:49+00:00" title="October 20, 2008 11:46AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmmm... for what it's worth, the cases when I've seen these kinds of games work well over time correlate pretty strongly with groups in which at least a subset of the players + GM socialize a good deal outside of session, AND spend a fair part of that socializing talking about the game (or the topics that inform the game). There's a huge amount of (rarely-acknowledged) out-of-band work that seems to go into building that consensual model of the fiction that this kind of play depends on.

Clinton</cite>So, I tell her to make a Wisdom check (with my own stat check system that I made up on the fly);</blockquote>\nSo I'm interested in how this interacts with the "Rulings, not Rules" Zen moment from the pamphlet.<br/><br/>First, let me state this is probably exactly the same thing I would have done.  BUT!  Let's pretend it's 1977, and Clinton's cool stat check method gets picked up on by Jason, who writes it up for Strategic Review, and Strategic Review publishes it, and campaigns all over the country start using it, and now it's a RULE, and it gets included in the next edition of D&amp;D, and a few years later, Clinton is running a game and the player says "do I sense any magic" and Clinton says "No", and the player says "but don't I even get a stat check?"  And we are well on our way to Hero System 3rd edition and rules for dogs &amp; cats sleeping together...<br/><br/>I think based on the philosophy of the pamphlet what was supposed to happen when the player said "Do I sense any magic", Clinton was supposed to think "hmmm, well she is a magic user, and she's got Wis of 13, so sure why not", and then tell the player "yes, vague forebodings" or conversely "hmmm, Wis 8", "well nothing really, the back of your knee kind of itches".<br/><br/>So essentially a mix of karma and drama resolution without codification.

Generally, there was a certain degree of respect for precedent - if you gave somebody a roll in situation A, it was generally expected that either they'd get a roll in situation B, or you'd have some reason why not. Which put a significant burden on the GM not to set precedents casually... and in turn I think may have fed some of the more egregiously fiat-y and tyrannical GMing styles associated with the model. If you're worried about giving the players a precedent - a rule - that they can then count on exploiting in a future situation, but you also want to maintain an illusion of a consistent and logical world with predictable laws, you probably tend towards keeping as much as possible of your decision-making behind the curtain.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_175614">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175614/#Comment_175614" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-20T15:00:50+00:00" title="October 20, 2008  3:00PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote> If you're worried about giving the players a precedent - a rule - that they can then count on exploiting in a future situation, but you also want to maintain an illusion of a consistent and logical world with predictable laws, you probably tend towards keeping as much as possible of your decision-making behind the curtain. </blockquote>\nIt's interesting to me how this feeds into a cycle of gaming style development, too.<br/><br/>By leaving the thought process on the rulings to the GM, if frees up mental capacity of the players to be used getting into character in an immersionist sense.<br/><br/>Now, provided that the players want that, and the play seems relatively consistent and fair, you're going really far in a direction that a significant number of people have said they want, even identify as <i><b>the</b></i> primary quality that makes a roleplaying game a roleplaying game from the perspective of a character-player.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175616">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Georgios" title="Georgios"><img alt="Georgios" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Georgios">Georgios</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175616/#Comment_175616" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-20T15:11:10+00:00" title="October 20, 2008  3:11PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite>Characters who live in the world know more about it than their players.

It seems to assume that the GM would hold back information from the players that the characters would have. Imagine the GM actually describing the situation as they would appear to somebody who's (more or less) intimately familiar with the world. If I'm the GM it's in my interest to meet the players halfway.<br/><br/>I think this disjoint you mention only happens, when either the GM or the players are holding back vital information. If the GM doesn't tell the players what their characters would see (or how they might interpret it differently from the players) or if the players don't lay out their character's reasoning, then you end up with an SIS with some serious gaps in it. Gaps, which are filled with guesswork, which in turn can lead to misunderstandings and eventually one person has to put their foot down. This is usually the GM and sometimes his decisions are contested based on the players' interpretation of the source material, previous experiences, "common sense", etc.  <br/><br/>But by then it's already too late.

I realized the cure to this is random encounters. Back in the day, I never understood the real purpose of random encounters. Their purpose isn't to be randomness that mucks with the player's plans. Their purpose is to put a cost on time. Without them, time is all too often abstract or there's some other strict time limit that threatens overall failure of the adventure because the players don't figure something out in time. With the random encounter system, players have to decide when it's worth spending the time to pixel bitch. They need to look for other clues, or consider the layout of the dungeon.<br/><br/>In last night's session, they pixel bitched in a short corridor they found after penetrating two rooms of a complex. Sure enough, there was a pit trap (too bad they didn't examine it closer and try to bypass it - they turned down a sequence leading up to a good treasure). Shortly after that, they did miss a sliding wall that trapped them. They did actually quickly change to look for a way out. One attempt led into another complex of tough monsters but good treasure. That was a dead end, so then they looked in the next most likely direction, and found the way past the sliding wall (which also was on a timer to reset in 24 turns, they took about 15 turns to get out).<br/><br/>What surprised me is that given the evidence of sliding walls they didn't look for some dwarf henchmen. They have three elves in the party which makes finding secret doors pretty easy. I don't tell them where the secret door is when an elf makes his 1-2 in 6 chance to sense secret doors when passing, instead I just tell them they sensed a door, then they need to search (but I don't make them search too hard), getting their 1-4 in 6 rolls for elves and 1-2 in 6 for everyone else.<br/><br/>There definitely is a learning curve, but I don't see that as a problem as long as the learning is reasonably fun. When you think about the best board games, most of them have a learning curve, and I think that's part of the lasting appeal of those games.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how I'd deal with something like the sense magic attempt, but I think that's a cool ruling Clinton made. Rafial does have a good point about things like this being systematized. The way the game has evolved through the editions, with much of that evolution being driven by systematizing these things is part of why a lot of old schoolers are saying "let's return to the original rules, before all this stuff got piled on." This allows each GM to tune these rulings to the group's preferences (sure, mostly the GM's preference, but I think players do weigh in a lot).<br/><br/>As to age of players, I think high school kids are capable of reaching functional play. It may take them a bit longer, and some individuals may never get it, and perhaps having older mentors helps. I saw functional play when I was in high school, though much of it was after I joined MIT's game club with it's range of members from junior high school aged kids through people at least in their 30s if not 40s. 90% of my play was with high school kids though. And before I joined the club, almost all of my play was with high school kids (the player who convinced me to go to MIT's game convention and thus introduced me to the club was a college student, and I got some mentorship from a college student and from Glen Blacow [but most of my mentorship from Glen was after I joined the club]).<br/><br/>That does point out that my experience was not of getting into the game in isolation. In fact, my best friend got the Basic D&amp;D set because his older brother had been playing the game. But see nothing wrong with an activity being most functional when it is part of a tradition that gets passed down. None of my major interests were evolved in isolation (model railroading, SF book reading, caving, and church are my other interests, all evolved with mentoring from others).<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_175681">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rustin" title="Rustin"><img alt="Rustin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rustin">Rustin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175681/#Comment_175681" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-21T10:40:06+00:00" title="October 21, 2008 10:40AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, thanks.

It's all a test of the players ability which is the heart of gamism.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_175753">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Meserach" title="Meserach"><img alt="Meserach" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Meserach">Meserach</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175753/#Comment_175753" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-22T00:26:00+00:00" title="October 22, 2008 12:26AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 22, 2008 12:27AM by Meserach.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rust</cite><br>I'm not sure I'm seeing how Gamist techniques fit in there.</br></blockquote>\nIn general, there are no Gamist techniques.

It's a quick and easy short hand that makes sense.  Which in this case is very true.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake a look at the suggestions the primer makes about running an old school game.  It's trying to create a playstyle that wont work well with an agenda other than gamist.  It has no support for narrativism, it doesnt really allow for characters having goals beyond attaining power and doesnt expect the gm to bring that persuit of power into question.  As for simulationism check out this quote from the player skill not character ability zen moment section.<br/>\n<br/>\n"Also: these games aren\u2019t simulations of what a dwarf raised in a particular society, and having a particular level of intelligence, would do when faced with certain challenges.  Old-style play is about keeping your character alive and making him into a legend."<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has a very specific goal for play and one that precludes any other if it's fully applied.  It does matchup well with Simulationism as defined by the threefold model but that is at the technique level and not as an agenda for the game as a whole.  Sure there is a lot of talk of having a detailed world that acts in a rational manner but that is all in service to the agenda of the game, the gm will create challenging encounter that the players will strive to take their characters through and come out with rewards and gain in power if they are successful.  If they fail there characters wont gain as much xp or loot at best and at worst the character could die.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the labels fit and I find them both meaningful and helpful, YMMV.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_175923">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175923/#Comment_175923" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-23T09:23:46+00:00" title="October 23, 2008  9:23AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see a lot of people using their own, different definitions of GNS here and expecting people with different definitions to agree with them. I strongly recommend we take one of two different approaches for the rest of this thread:<br/><br/>1. Stop talking about GNS and just talk about the Primer on its own terms.<br/>2. Clearly define what we mean by Gamism, Simulationism, and Narrativism and further discuss how they relate to the Primer and old-school gaming.<br/><br/>Certainly, if we continue down the path we're on, nothing good will come of it. I see people mixing up GNS and "threefold" (which is usually GDS), and using their own definitions of GNS that don't correspond to the usual "Forgey" versions. I really don't want to get into a jargon war here, and I don't want to see this thread devolve into one, either. If people want to understand the "common" Forge understanding of what GNS means, I'm happy to help people there, but it should go in another thread and there's only so far we can go without talking about actual play.<br/><br/><b>In general, I'm not sure that there's a lot of value in understanding the author's intent here.

The problem with trying to apply the techniques is that they wont work with every intended play style or for every person. <br/>\n<br/>\nLet's say your playstyle leans more to playing that dwarf with a certain level of intelligence from a certain culture and react in the way you feel he should react in the situation.  The player makes suboptimal choices in situations where he feels it would be appropriate for the dwarf.  According to the primer the GM should not respect those choices but should instead hammer the player for them and quite possibly kill the character and possibly the whole group. <br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of people would see that as bad play on the part of the GM but it's a base assumption of this style of play.  If you go in and try to use these techniques without taking that into account you can end up with a game session that could destroy your group.  If you are up front about it and everyone signs on and understands the implications of that base assumption then it may work, but people will have to be flexible and agree to change their playstyle.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo can you take bits and pieces of this advice and use it in a game where you have a different playstyle?  Possibly but I think it's likely to cause frustration and problems more than it will help your game.  I know in my games if we were left to pixelbitch out the answer to how to find a secret door or open a trap we're more likely to get bored give up on the answer and go shoot something or start it on fire.  Likewise I wouldnt expect anyone in my group to go through the motions of trying to talk their way past a guard and basing it on how well they do when in my mind those things come down to not what you say but how you say it.

Standard Illusionism is making a plot that seems to be player driven but is really being subtly rail roaded (the classic example is give the players various routes but have the same events happen no matter which route they choose). Gamist Illusionism is playing a game in such a way that it appears to be run by a disinterested arbiter but is constantly being tweaked so that you always have juuuuust the right amount of challenge for the players (ideally allowing the players to just baaaaaaaaaarely win). In old school games, GMs have a bit broader latitude to pull this off since the rules don't cover as many situations. If done right, this sort of style of gaming rewards creativity by having whatever loopy creative plan that the PCs came up with just happen to be the right one for the situation, at least some of the time...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179083">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179083/#Comment_179083" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-18T05:58:29+00:00" title="November 18, 2008  5:58AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nah.

Should that be called O-S+1, maybe? I think it's a style that develops slightly later, and seems to be actually pretty popular right up until the present day. Certainly I've engaged in that sort of tweaking, own a couple of games that pretty much suggest it, and have had good times in that sort of game.<br/><br/>I've also seen ones that crashed and burned extremely badly when the players wanted something more hard-core game-y and realized what I was doing.<br/><br/>Now, do you think that there is a way to make a game a series of challenges, but allow tweaking openly? Perhaps the GM gets the hero points rather than the character players?<br/><br/>Come to think of it, that could be very funny, especially if the GM rolls the number of save-the-character points and has to keep it secret. The game is played "straight", but the GM is required to spend a point to save any PC that would die from plain old failed rolls, narrating in some bizarre circumstance. Unused ones become XPs or something similar.<br/><br/>It might work really well for an Indiana Jones type game ( God knows that guy gets saved by weird and unlikely stuff constantly).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179102">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179102/#Comment_179102" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-18T07:37:28+00:00" title="November 18, 2008  7:37AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OS+1 sounds interesting to me.

I think there was wisdom in not codifying this procedure. Where D&amp;D; really started to run into trouble was with the Thief class, back in the 1975 Greyhawk supplement.<br/>\n<br/>\n'Gamist Illusionism' is not right, though there is such a thing and people play that way sometimes, what I mean is that it's not a right general description of what Mythmere is talking about. The point is the display of real world cleverness in an imaginary setup. The game is being clever and being recognized as clever by the GM and the group. That's real gamism. The game system is a prop which acts as a constraint on that. It's not the GM making fake challenges. Actually, it's the GM presenting you with situations that you probably don't have the in-game resources on your character sheet to cope with and telling you to cope with it. Imagination is the tool for overcoming. There's a sadomasochistic aspect to this but it's fun for many, with a GM who you share sensibilities with, is smart enough to judge things reasonably, and is not so ego-invested he won't let himself be beat by a good plan he didn't think of.<br/>\n<br/>\n'The point' in one kind of play, anyway. There are a lot of dimensions here.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's not true that kids can't cope with this kind of play, though there is more potential for breakdown with adolescents. But I had lots of fantastic groups that ran under it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, there's a lot of stuff here. I am editing a whole magazine devoted to developing various facets of what I see as old-school (Fight On!), and I can't say briefly here anything better than what the various authors in that magazine say there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179399">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Calithena" title="Calithena"><img alt="Calithena" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Calithena">Calithena</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179399/#Comment_179399" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-19T20:52:28+00:00" title="November 19, 2008  8:52PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 19, 2008 8:53PM by Calithena.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Most of the time in old-style gaming, you don\u2019t use a rule; you make a ruling.  It\u2019s easy    to understand that sentence, but it takes a flash of insight to really \u201cget it.\u201d  The players    can describe any action, without needing to look at a character sheet to see if they \u201ccan\u201d    do it.  The referee, in turn, uses common sense to decide what happens or rolls a die if he    thinks there\u2019s some random element involved, and then the game moves on.  This is why    characters have so few numbers on the character sheet, and why they have so few    specified abilities."<br/>\n<br/>\nClinton: When I first read this, I cringed, thinking about the idea of hard GM fiat. Reading it again, though, I realized it's kind of player-empowering. The people I play with are cool, and we don't screw each other over. I'd trust any of them to be the arbitrator for an in-game event, and in reality, we do this every week. If looking up a rule is taking too long or is boring, we skip it and use an extrapolation from the rules we do know.<br/>\n<hr class="bbcode_rule"/>\n<br/>\nClinton,<br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of your lexicon I'd connect that quotation to Vincent's oft-repeated comment that he'd rather play freeform than use the rules of a traditional RPG. The old-old-school ('really old school', as Ralph calls it) IS freeform. You have to understand the rules, etc. as add-ons, props you use to adjudicate the freeform. What Myth's describing there is just that, that underlying freeform structure of the (very) traditional RPG.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhether or not a player or GM invokes a rule is 'fiat' is a really complicated question that I feel like you have to be careful with. It's a little analogous to the question of whether a writer chooses what happens to his characters. In one sense yes, but anyone who's done the thing knows that it's not really that simple, that the fiction subjectively takes on a life of its own. And the good GM in my opinion is more constrained by this than the creative writer because he's got the whole group's imaginative reality to consider, not only his own.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7917/quick-primer-for-old-school-gaming-is-blowing-my-mind" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7917/quick-primer-for-old-school-gaming-is-blowing-my-mind" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7917/quick-primer-for-old-school-gaming-is-blowing-my-mind/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F7917%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F7917%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
