We want Way X to be a natural result of playing according to the mechanics.<br/>At least, I do.</blockquote>Problem is, Thunder, that your narrow focus on mechanics bereave you of a balanced, methodical approach to roleplaying. You narrow the spectre of tools available and stunt the broad field of possibilities in RPGs, by thinking mechanics is all there is to it. There is nothing "natural" in ignoring how the verbal interaction itself may be used to strengthen the gameplay in a roleplaying game that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is</span> verbal interaction. There is nothing "natural" in ignoring tools pertaining to group dynamics in games that play out in groups, and has great ensemble-drama as the most common goal.<br/><br/>The upsurge of innovative design in the relatively small community of Nordic RPG-designers, is due to the fact that <i>method</i> (with mechanics as a part of it) has been made the basis for thinking on how RPGs are created and played.<br/><br/>I am aware that "method" may have other connotations in English than in Norwegian. The way you use "system" indicates that it has taken the place of method in your terminology on RPGs. It may be that this is due to the strong mechanical focus of American thinkers on RPGs. My take is that <b>method matters</b>. If you don't know <i>how to play the game</i>, you will play something else (possibly similar), and most likely make a bungle out of the game you pretend to play.<br/><br/>This part: <i>"We don't want to play in way X just because we're told to play in way X"</i>, is in my view a bit to juvenile to be of any worth as a principle. As already stated I do not find it "natural" in any way to ignore advice on how to play a game I've bought. My idea is that by reading the game, and following the instructions, <i>all of them</i>, I will give the game my best shot at being played the way the designer intended. If the game don't work that way ... ok, then the reason is bad design, not me lacking the will to try it out.<br/><br/><i>Please bear with me; not all of you approach game-design with a narrow mechanical-focus, I know.

Thanks for pointing out the name-option. And thanks for answering! I enjoy this kind of discussion. :-)<br/><br/><b>You ask: </b><i>Does the gameplay not rise from the mechanics?</i> No, it don't. In most classical RPGs the mechanics is the most prominent feature. This is however, not true for all modern RPGs. I've played lots of modern games of high quality with little or no mechanics in them. How can any gameplay rise from games of no mechanics if your claim is true? The truth is that <i>method </i>is the full picture, to which mechanics belongs as one of several different areas of tools.<br/><br/>In a recent writing on a GM-workshop I named six areas the GM of a classical RPG needs to master in a game-session: <b>leadership, practical social-psychology, group dynamics, dialogue, setting and mechanics/resolution-system</b>. This may give you some hint on how broad I believe an effective game-method must be, to be an effective support for the GM.<br/><br/>The mechanics are prominent in many classical RPGs, but they still need to be emulated by some kind of methodical approach. The way we play the game is decided by more than mechanics alone. As a game-designer my aim is to make my method balanced and effective. I have found it easier to do so if I keep my mind open to the fact that a roleplaying session is as complex an affair as any interaction between a group of people. I must strive to make a good basis for great gameplay, and may not do that if I limit myself to vectoring how the die is used (to put it very bluntly).<br/><br/><b>As for horror: </b>the horror arise from players being immersed in the story, and actually tasting some of the fear of their characters. You may happen upon such a state by chance, but it will be achieved a lot more often by the tricks and tools of the trade, when those are carefully picked and modulated for the game by the conscious game.designer. Effective game-design has more to it than creating a functioning task-resolution system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152222">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152222/#Comment_152222" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-22T08:20:43+00:00" title="June 22, 2008  8:20AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a lot more to mechanics than task-resolution.<br/>I think (one of) the greatest Social Contract mechanics to come in recent years is the Psychology die in Burning Wheel.<br/><br/>Sure, there are games where you have mood and it arises from non-mechanical issues. I can't argue that it sometimes works, I argue about using it and propagating it.<br/><br/>Telling the group what to use, what to do, instead of giving them tools that will let those things arise naturally is a band-aid process, one that is used for pragmatic reasons. Often, because the design isn't good enough to produce the desired feel on its own.<br/>Let's look at the issue of "Inter-player strife", or "inter party trust". You had it arise naturally, or you had a game tell you that it is an expected thing to occur, and as such, players and game masters would affect things in such a manner that it'd occur, even if the rule-set did not contribute to it at all.<br/>In recent years, games came out which dealt with the issue mechanically, The Mountain Witch, to name a notable one. I posit that in such games those issues would rise organically, whether or not they were told for it to happen or not, because the tool, the mechanic, gives rise to them. This is what I am arguing in favour of.<br/><br/>Of course, it is best when the mechanics exist, and you tell the group what it should produce, for a heightened effect, and for less time for them to 'figure' it. I am opposed to the text alone replacing any tools, and being the sole source of such rise.<br/>We could use D&amp;D and tell the group to strive for inter-party strife, we could use the exact same ruleset and tell the group to strive for chivalrism, and so on and so forth. I see those as much weaker instances, as much poorer "Mood creators".<br/><br/>I am not opposed to the mood text, I'm opposed to it when it attempts to create something that wasn't there before.<br/><br/>As you said, a game-session is decided by much more than mechanics, it is decided by random and uncontrollable factors, so let me take care of what is for me to control. If I want a game session to go with a certain mood, I can't trust the group to desire it, but I can give them a system that is built towards producing them, and hoping the group won't play the game unless they <i>are</i> actually interested in those results, and will use method, but to bolster my system, not to replace it.<br/><br/>Also, sure we can use method, and method alone, but then, why are we playing these games? It's counter to the job of game design; just have a group of people sit around a table, and have them tell stories with a certain mood/theme. And while I know I am exaggerating, mood and theme? They're not part of the design process; designing a system that produces them is, but not merely telling the group what you want them to do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_152225">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152225/#Comment_152225" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-22T09:04:15+00:00" title="June 22, 2008  9:04AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see you insist on naming the use of mechanics "natural" and "organic". Funny!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thunder_God</cite>Sure, there are games where you have mood and it arises from non-mechanical issues. I can't argue that it sometimes works, I argue about using it and propagating it.</blockquote>Why? Why do you insist on arguing this? What is wrong with having, for instance; a GM being aware of how his initial greetings of the players may help set the mood for the session? What is wrong with the GM confronting the players in effective ways, to make them dive into the drama with even greater engagement? What is wrong whit having the GM actually know what to do, to make the game a tight and tickling experience? What is wrong with propagating certain play-styles in the players, when a certain style is necessary to make the real game? As long as this is all part of a concise and effective method, it is as <i>natural </i>or <i>organic </i>as anything you may come up with related to mechanics. I have a major classical RPG publication on my CV, and have worked the classical field of RPGs for over a decade, and I am, no offense meant; slightly amused by your unflinching trust in what mechanics alone can achieve for a game.<br/><br/>And mind you: I am talking of <i>method </i>in a way that include mechanics. Only my perspective is a bit broader. ;-) The broader perspective is a bit more demanding on the designer, and design is indeed possible within the frames you propagate, but still; today an effective design within the classical RPG-framework are better off with a broader perspective. You need to do something more, to make it worth your while making another classical roleplaying game, you know.<br/><br/><b>However:</b> for green designers in the classical field I recommend making games the old way; with heavy focus on mechanics. Mechanics may very well be seen as a basis for good design in the classical RPG, and as such it is wise for new designers to acquire the necessary skills pertaining to this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152226/#Comment_152226" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-22T09:10:53+00:00" title="June 22, 2008  9:10AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have no problem with those things happening in groups, in actual play, enacted by players and/or GM.<br/><br/>I am against claiming that these are design solutions.<br/><br/>Tomas, because something works, you can't assume two things:<br/>1.

However: if you give the players tools to make particular happenings/moods, and the purposed happenings/moods arise in ways far stronger than any normal game has it, then you may trust your design to be effective. There is no need to humble your design-self into non-existence. Take credit where credit is earned.<br/><br/>I sense that you discuss this point due to bafflement. The thought of effective design in other spheres of the RPG than the mechanical one seems to baffle you. I recommend trying some modern RPGs to experience how this may work. One of the most effective and ground-breaking designs of recent years are the game "<b><a href="http://norwegianstyle.wordpress.com/2007/12/07/37/" rel="nofollow"><b>Until We Sink ...</b></a></b>" by Magnus Jakobsson.

That is a novel way to interpret the mechanics-term for me. So it may be that this discussion is due to a misunderstanding, partly, as so often before.

My particular artistic agenda is: <b>Games to change your life! </b>So I am not very concerned about making games for the average gamer (although I have done, and do it still, occasionally). I'm trying to direct my game-design towards the general public, and that is a long stone throw from the average gamer. Still: I'm very much into making games that are fun to play, some way or another. It might not be your kind of fun, but still.<br/><br/>Whether you call my games, or any other modern roleplaying game, a RPG, does not concern me the least. When the creators of D&amp;D call their game a RPG it is fine with me. It is just swell that the creators of WoW or Baldurs Gate or whatever call their games RPGs too. I have no need to narrow the field, or to protect the label "RPG". A game is what it is, and what the creator calls it is a minor point. It's a <i>label </i>for your convenience, nothing more.<br/><br/>But that aside: certainly these games are roleplaying games!<br/><br/>Other Norwegian designers are a lot less serious in intent than me, and some of them are quite happy to cater for the average gamer. You should browse the <a href="http://norwegianstyle.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow"><b>Norwegian Style</b></a> blog and try out some of the nice designs there. By the way: <b>Until we sink ...</b> is a very happy-go-lucky game with nice mood. Very much what you want to play an evening with your friends.

So what? And once again: why? Why do mechanics need to have preeminence in your design-universe? I ask in earnest here, Guy, as I believe a honest answer will make you see what your current line of thought is all about. I do see some positive basis for your claim, but in regard to what I am talking about (a methodical approach, using the full toolbox) it seems a bit archaic.<br/><br/>I am convinced your idea has some merit, at the level you seem to be. What I am trying to do, is to give you the full picture; mechanics placed in a context that may be used to work the full field of effective game-design, to facilitate design that goes beyond the scope of games known to us at present. I hope you will be able to use this for further development, if or when your current line of thought has run its course.<br/><br/>Nice to have had this discussion with you!

I've been mulling over these very issues, but I don't have much to report back yet, hence not throwing in my opinion on the topic yet.<br/><br/>I do have something in response to a bit from your opening post:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tomas HVM</cite>This part:<i>"We don't want to play in way X just because we're told to play in way X"</i>, is in my view a bit to juvenile to be of any worth as a principle. As already stated I do not find it "natural" in any way to ignore advice on how to play a game I've bought. My idea is that by reading the game, and following the instructions,<i>all of them</i>, I will give the game my best shot at being played the way the designer intended. If the game don't work that way ... ok, then the reason is bad design, not me lacking the will to try it out.<br/></blockquote>\nOne thing I find very interesting is that across RPG texts, there's a huge difference in how much the writers thought the "how to play" text <i>even matters to the author</i>, it seems. (In other words, some games seem to have this text written as if it is going to be ignored.)<br/><br/>The place I've been struck by that recently is in the D&amp;D 4th edition Dungeon Master's Guide, which shows it was written by a committee at times. There are bits of "GM Advice" that are extremely specific ways to play the game that will help produce the designer's intended mindset for play, and then there are bits of "GM Advice" that feel like copy-pasted boilerplate from older editions, with no clear agenda. And they're mixed in with each other.<br/><br/>One thought I've been kicking around, is that there has <i>got</i> to be a better way to present this method-building type of advice than the way it's currently done. Again (sorry to refer to D&amp;D, but I promise I'm not talking about any of the mechanics in the text), the 4th edition books have some pretty useful stuff in terms of "way to approach the game" in the Introduction/What is an RPG? section, where it'll be ignored by almost anyone. I like the Jeepform method of just flat-out stating what the game should "feel like", but I feel like it fits short-form games best and have no idea how to integrate that into other types of texts. That middle ground where the game clearly states what it's about within the rules itself, I guess that's the Holy Grail of creating a functional method-based game? Or maybe it's just that I have trouble conceptualizing how to talk about this stuff within the text in a way that isn't going to look like "just advice".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152796">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152796/#Comment_152796" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-24T19:27:10+00:00" title="June 24, 2008  7:27PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 24, 2008 7:28PM by Callan_S.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hello Guy,<br/><br/>I think I agree with your position, but I'd like to check our relative positions by giving an example.<br/><br/>Say there was an RPG for sale that has one blank page with 'Have fun!' written on it.

With rules in boardgames, for example, you can look at your resource situation and decide how ruthless you will be to your fellow players. "be ruthless to your fellow players" doesn't offer any choice - do it, or your not playing.<br/><br/>Most boardgame rules offer you alot of choice about how you deal with the situation. <br/>"be ruthless to your fellow players" is a script. I suppose there might be an arguement about you deciding how ruthless, but based on what - just how ruthless you feel like being? I'd describe that as just* acting. In a boardgame, when you decide to be ruthless, you actually are being ruthless (within the confines of the game).<br/><br/>* The phrase 'just acting' gives this a negative context. And yeah, I don't think much of it.

There must be at least 1 or 2 natives.<br/>Introduce your character<br/>After all introductions, figure out what your character's opinion of the other characters is (this may be changed during play)<br/>Figure out what your character is trying to accomplish (this may be changed during play)<br/><br/><b>Step 2</b><br/>Remove the starting and ending cards and set them aside for further use<br/>Remove (randomly) 8 event cards from the deck (these will not be used during the game)<br/>Shuffle the remaining 5 event cards and place them face down on the table<br/><br/><b>Step 3 - Day One</b><br/>Read the starting card<br/>introduce the 3rd topic as common knowledge<br/>Have a conversation<br/> - describing actions only when it is inappropriate to act them out<br/> - all other actions should be acted out<br/> - players should include facial expression, gestures, etc., when acting out the conversation<br/> - any topic is allowed<br/> - you may talk about any topic as long as other players are interested in having a conversation about it<br/> - if you want to talk about the event on the event card, do so<br/> - anything anyone says to explain the event card is true<br/> - no character can lie to submit a false explanation for an event card<br/> - don't have your character object or accuse others of lying "too much"<br/> - what you say must not contradict what has already been said<br/> - You do not play out any event that happens outside of the conversation (discuss those events in conversation)<br/> - You may make up past history and events during the conversation<br/> - Cooperate to create an "exciting experience"<br/> - If the event on an event card is explained, mark it as completed<br/> - You may expand on explanations even after the corresponding card is marked<br/>A participant may leave the conversation at any time<br/>When 2 participants have left the conversation, the day ends.<br/><b><br/>Step 4 - Additional days</b><br/>Draw and event card and read it<br/>Carry out a conversation as per day 1 (ending it in the same manner)<br/>Mark event cards completed as appropriate<br/>After day 4, add the ending card to the deck and shuffle<br/>Repeat until ending card is drawn<br/><br/><b>Step 5 - Ending Card</b><br/>When the ending card is drawn, read it<br/>The location of the conversation changes from an island to a boat<br/>Conduct a conversation<br/>Try to explain as many of the events created during the conversation as possible<br/>The conversation cannot end until all event cards have been explained and marked<br/>After all cards are marked and two participants leave the conversation, it ends<br/>Any player may make a final dramatic monologue<br/><br/><b>Play Ends</b><br/><br/>I would definitely not call this game groundbreaking in any sense of the word.  It's just a rehash of improv theatre exercises from the late 50s, 60s and 70s still used today.  Like those exercises it has rules about not contradicting other participants, the use of guiding props (event cards in the case) as well as a set start and end time, methods for characters to enter a scene and conditions that cause a scene to end (2 participants leave the conversation).<br/><br/>All those can be great practices to include in a game, but are hardly ground breaking or new nor special.  Neither do they constitute a method/system that helps determine what is accepted as fact in the shared story that is in any way better than dicing off for it.  <b>There's certainly nothing intrinsically  superior about a method which basically amounts to <i>whoever says it first gets to say what is what and no one is allowed to contradict it</i>.</b><br/><br/>Tomas, bringing these improv techniques back to our attention is most certainly appreciated.  Graham's book<i> Play UnSafe</i> is an example of a similar effort (I'd highly recommend checking it out <a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/1436677" rel="nofollow">here</a>).  Might I suggest though, that making further effort to understand what others are offering in the discussion.  Here's a good exercise.  The next time someone makes a point you disagree with, state it back to them in your own words and then comment about it after they have agreed that you are understanding what they are getting at.  I think you got stuck by the word "mechanic" and missed most of the content of Guy's posts.  I'd recommend rereading them and wherever you see "system" or "mechanic" think of it as your method term.  That it's the procedures and/or protocols for determining what is accepted into the shared story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152854">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kuma" title="Kuma"><img alt="Kuma" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/010/nUOBV5SCXNNTN.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kuma">Kuma</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152854/#Comment_152854" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-25T04:26:11+00:00" title="June 25, 2008  4:26AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And here I thought this was going to be a thread about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oulipo" rel="nofollow">Oulipo</a> and RPG design.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tomas HVM</cite>You want this. So what? And once again: why? Why do mechanics need to have preeminence in your design-universe? I ask in earnest here, Guy, as I believe a honest answer will make you see what your current line of thought is all about. I do see some positive basis for your claim, but in regard to what I am talking about (a methodical approach, using the full toolbox) it seems a bit archaic.<br/><br/>I am convinced your idea has some merit, at the level you seem to be. What I am trying to do, is to give you the full picture; mechanics placed in a context that may be used to work the full field of effective game-design, to facilitate design that goes beyond the scope of games known to us at present. I hope you will be able to use this for further development, if or when your current line of thought has run its course.<br/></blockquote>\nI'm jumping in late, but here's my two centavos.  I'm with Guy - if a designer has a certain experience that they want to create with a game, but the roadmap to that experience isn't provided in the game, then that's bad design.  Furthermore, a lot of designs seem to handwave this and put the onus on the players to understand what the designer intends for the experience to feel like.  That's not design at all, it's just <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Spitballing" rel="nofollow">spitballing</a> on paper (slang link provided for the non-English speakers).<br/><br/>We seem to keep coming back to this idea that as long as you can point to a group has their ducks in a row, then any design is a working design.  I just don't buy that.  It's lazy on the part of the designer to assume that their audience is composed of people who think exactly like they do, and that these people will spackle in the mechanical inadequacies of your game with their own awesome.<br/><br/>This is also why games should be beta-tested before publishing: Any game playtested only with the author and his group will likely be hobbled in just this manner.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_152865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152865/#Comment_152865" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-25T06:05:34+00:00" title="June 25, 2008  6:05AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: M Eryesen</cite>I would definitely not call this game groundbreaking in any sense of the word.</blockquote>Matthew: you are trying to be diligent here; "breaking the example down", as you say.

Nothing more to say about that. Sorry!</blockquote>\nThis is exactly what I was talking about.<br/><br/>Look what you did in the above paragraph.  You looked for a reason to write-off and ignore what I had to say rather than engaging with it.  You did your best to find reasons to invalidate my position and then used that to ignore what I was getting at without ever spending any effort to understand.  You found an excuse to assert that something I was saying undermines what I was saying so you can conveniently ignore it.<br/><br/>So, assume I have a level of experience with improv theatre, techniques and the like that I can understand and appreciate the effects of all of the techniques in the example game.  Heck, procede with the assumption that I've played the example game itself.  Remove any impediment to your ability to actually engage what I am saying.  Remove any excuse you'd like to use to ignore what I'm saying.<br/><br/>I'll repeat my statements from my earlier post:<br/><br/>All those can be great practices to include in a game, but are hardly ground breaking or new nor special. Neither do they constitute a method/system that helps determine what is accepted as fact in the shared story that is in any way better than dicing off for it. There's certainly nothing intrinsically superior about a method which basically amounts to<i> whoever says it first gets to say what is what and no one is allowed to contradict it</i>.<br/><br/>And some questions:<br/><br/>Do you think the method used to determine what is accepted as factual in the shared story/narrative is important?  Will different methods produce different kinds of play?  What about procedures that determine who speaks when and what themes, topics, etc., they are to address?<br/><br/>What makes a method that is basically <i> whoever says something first (and they can talk about anything) gets to say what is what and no one is allowed to contradict it</i> a better choice than other mechanics that can be employed to lend credibility to inputs into the shared imagination?  What are the characteristics of the desired play that would make this a better choice?  What characteristics of desired play would such a method be counter productive?  Can such an approach produce play relevant to the underlying themes of the game regardless of what those themes are?  What allows it to do so?<br/><br/>Here's a paragraph from your original post:\n<blockquote>narrow focus on mechanics bereave you of a balanced, methodical approach to roleplaying. You narrow the spectre of tools available and stunt the broad field of possibilities in RPGs, by thinking mechanics is all there is to it. There is nothing "natural" in ignoring how the verbal interaction itself may be used to strengthen the gameplay in a roleplaying game that is verbal interaction.</blockquote>\nHow do the procedures in "Until We Sink" not stunt possibilities or represent a limited toolset?  When it comes down to what is accepted as factual in the shared story, "Until We Sink" is as limited as we can possibly get when it comes to tools it uses.  It literally has one tool.  That whoever says something first establishes it as true and no one can contradict the statement in the future.  As far as what goes into shared story, it's a one trick pony.  It's procedures offer nothing to shape what types of things someone can say.  The rules text specifically broadens the subject matter available to be conversed about and provides players the authority to talk about any subject at all.<br/><br/>Your statements above also assume that procedures somehow ignore verbal interaction.  They don't.  A mechanic/procedure/system includes the verbal interaction necessary to implement it.  In many cases, the procedure itself will include specific instructions about who speaks and what themes, topics, etc., they are to speak about.<br/><br/>And example of this would be the excellent game, Don't Rest Your Head.  The result of a die roll will determine who narrates and what themes important to game play must be present in the narration.  For example, the dice might show that player C narrates and that madness dominates.  So Player C now must start the next section of verbal interaction and the overriding theme of the interaction must be madness, insanity.  That's procedure that produces play releveant to the situation.  That's mechanics that produces verbal interaction relevant to the themes addressed during play.<br/><br/>So, can you actually respond to any of this, or are you going to simply find an excuse to ignore it, say something like "Nothing more to say about that. Sorry!" and demonstrate your unwillingness to engage with others in discussion?<br/><br/>I'm totally fine if that's the case.  Let me know and I'll get out of the way of your preaching.  That's cool too.  Just let me know either way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_152962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152962/#Comment_152962" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-25T12:59:31+00:00" title="June 25, 2008 12:59PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Stake-setting is currently an extremely good example of mechanics resolved wholly through discourse.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_153003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153003/#Comment_153003" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-25T15:15:47+00:00" title="June 25, 2008  3:15PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 25, 2008 3:32PM by TomasHVM.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: M Eryesen</cite>Neither do they constitute a method/system that helps determine what is accepted as fact in the shared story that is in any way better than dicing off for it.

There is no need to defend classical RPGs in this thread. I am fully committed to classical games, as well as modern ones, and see no need to set them up against each other.<br/><br/>I am talking about how we, as game-designers, need to evolve our skills and insights to enable design beyond the limitations of games as we know them. This is true both in the field of classical RPGs and of modern RPGs. Roleplaying games need to evolve, and only through ambitious designers may they do so. This is what a site like this is all about, in my view.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: M Eryesen</cite>How do the procedures in "Until We Sink" not stunt possibilities or represent a limited toolset?</blockquote>Ah, but you misunderstand again! I am talking about the tools a <i>designer </i>needs to master; the broad spectre of tools that enables a designer to make informed choices on the game he is writing. I am <i><b>not </b></i>talking of the limited tools present in one specific game. To make games that strive to achieve depth through <i>narrow focus</i> is indeed my preferred mode of design these days.<br/><br/><b>The game</b> should have a limited and focused tool-set, for the GM/players to use.<br/><b>The designer</b> should have a tool-box of all-sorts, to facilitate his design-choices.<br/><br/>I wrote this on "Until...": <i>One of the most effective and ground-breaking designs of recent years are the game "<b><a href="http://norwegianstyle.wordpress.com/2007/12/07/37/" rel="nofollow"><b>Until We Sink ...</b></a></b>" by Magnus Jakobsson.</i><br/><br/>I maintain that this game really is both effective and groundbreaking. You have posted that the elements of this game is known to us since the fifties. I know that very well. The point is that this game utilize elements like these in a RPG, and make a unique <i>game-method</i> out of it. If you want to "break the game down", as you say, you should take care to comment on <i>the whole</i> too. Any game is bigger than the sum of its elements, Matthew. The elements are building blocks of a <i>method, </i>and how the method works is revealed in play. I do <b>not </b>assume that you can understand and appreciate the effects of all of the techniques in the example game. I have repeatedly failed to do so myself in game after game, and i am fairly experienced in the field (as a designer and professional RPG-consultant).<br/><br/>So my advice to you is simple; hold back on critique on a game until you have seen it in play. Do not make bold statements on shaky ground. I have played this game, and the experience has changed how I think about RPG-design altogether. It is one of several modern designs that has made a mark in the rapid development of RPGs these days, and for me it is THE most groundbreaking of them all.<br/><br/>I hope you feel satisfied with this answer, Matthew.

But you keep telling us we don't understand until we <i>play</i> it?<br/><br/>What if, rather than it being playable, it's 'act-able', as in you can <i>act </i>out the instructions?<br/><br/>I'm just saying what if. If it can't actually be played, but you insist it can and we don't know until we play, then your just blocking us (whether you intend it or not).<br/><br/>Now, I think the next step is defining 'play' and possibly also 'act'. To avoid a big semantic debate, I royally* declare everybody can use their own definition of each word. People can't go "Oh, that's not the right definition of the word". Bad use of words doesn't matter here, only good communication about RPGs.<br/><br/>Because once we see what you mean by 'play', we might all go 'OHHHH, I see what you mean now...'. And when other people write what they mean by 'play', you might go 'OHHH...'. I guess I should write my definition - I'll draft it in my head and post latter.<br/><br/>* <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SweeneyTodd" title="SweeneyTodd"><img alt="SweeneyTodd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SweeneyTodd">SweeneyTodd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153046/#Comment_153046" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-25T20:14:39+00:00" title="June 25, 2008  8:14PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 25, 2008 8:15PM by SweeneyTodd.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just so I can catch up, it sounds like the discussion's kind of focusing on what constitues a mechanic as opposed to advice?<br/><br/>For what it's worth, I think there's definately mechanics in <i>Sink</i>. There aren't any resolution mechanics, maybe that's the sticking point? I view "Take this role" and "this thing must happen during this scene" as mechanics. Drawing a card and taking an action in response definately sounds like a mechanic to me.<br/><br/>Assuming I'm talking about the same thing you guys are, I definately agree that it's not about whether one kind of mechanic is superior to another, they all have their uses. It seems more productive to, say, talk about when you might use one versus the other? (I get that you could read some of Tomas' comments as "This is the right way to do it", but it seems clear to me he's advocating these types of rules not because they're better but because he's interested in seeing where that would go.)<br/><br/>Hm, let me think. How about <i>Amber Diceless RPG</i>? The resolution mechanic in it is pretty much "GM decides based on the statistics and other factors." That section, and many others, is written in a way that if you decide that mechanics and advice are two separate things, it mixes the hell out of them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_153066">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153066/#Comment_153066" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-26T00:47:43+00:00" title="June 26, 2008 12:47AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 26, 2008 1:08AM by TomasHVM.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Callan S.</cite>What if it's not actually playable?

To discuss if this game is <i>playable or not</i> is way too absurd for me. The game was given as an example, for those willing to give games of another sort a try.<br/><br/>As for definitions of "mechanics", I am fairly traditional in that respect. I hold mechanics to be the <b>randomization and/or quantification of conflict</b> in some way or another; by rolling dice or drawing cards or whatever. More often than not it involves juggling with dots or numbers on your character sheet, or some counters you got in your pocket. I consider mechanics to be a very central and applicable part of the designers toolbox. Some of the things you may do in a roleplaying game are dependent on good mechanics, in my view.<br/><br/>Other aspects of the method has traditionally been considered <b>advice </b>on "play style". I consider it an integral part of the game and how it plays. I want to make design that makes use of the vast possibilities buried in the fields of unexplored game tools. I want to develop tools is all areas of interaction, to make a better and broader design possible.<br/><br/>For myself I have named seven different compartments of <b>The Designer Toolbox</b>:<br/><b>- leadership: </b>how to lead a game-session, how to avoid and resolve conflicts between players, how to set rythm and drive in the game<br/><b>- practical social-psychology: </b>how to make players step into the character shoes, how to evoke emotions in players<br/><b>- group dynamics/rituals:</b> how to set peer pressure, how make good moods, how to entice/ensnare the player-group, how to make internal intrigue<br/><b>- dialogue: </b>how to steer dialogue, how to use voices as an emotional tool, how to set frames for the player-dialogue, how to make language settings<br/><b>- setting:</b> how to make and use fictional elements (including characters), how to weave the drama, intrigue, conflict, themes of play<br/><b>- material:</b> how you make the game; book, cards, maps, lay-out, hand-outs, pebbles, dice; the solid stuff that IS the game<br/><b>- mechanics/resolution-system:</b> how to vector risk-taking, how to make system that manipulates the player-character relationship, etc.<br/><br/>(not going into the details on mechanics here, I gather you all know a lot of them)<br/><br/>There is nothing new in any of this. The "new" thing is thinking of this as areas in which to develop <i>tools</i>, not merely advice. In each of these areas (and possible more too) I see a multitude of<i> effective tools</i> to be had. When tools from several of these areas are combined  into clever "methods" (interactive systems where the tools links up and create a game-environment to catch your soul), you get possibilities not hitherto known to game-designers. It's all about regarding <i>the method</i>  as a whole you, the game-designer, should work in its full breadth.<br/><br/>I hold that this is some of the way design has to go in the years to come. Designers has to make informed choices now much more than they used to, by the simple reason that uninformed design has had its day. RPGs are growing up, and we have to keep pushing the boundaries of what we may do with our games, to keep up with the need for new games. To make the old games anew is a dead exercise.<br/><br/>It's quite simple: game-designers need to make new games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153069/#Comment_153069" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-26T02:26:42+00:00" title="June 26, 2008  2:26AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote> The "new" thing is thinking of this as areas in which to develop tools, not merely advice</blockquote>\nThis seems almost like what I've been saying all along.<br/><br/>Mechanics for me, hm, it's a bit harder to quantify it in words: actions in the rule-set that are carried on player-level that affect the game, inside or outside. That sounds about right to me.<br/>So the above example of rules that enable you to be ruthless are mechanics. They're a tool. Being told to be ruthless is not an action, and if it leads to an action, it did not originate from the rule-set, and it is "merely advice".<br/><br/>I hope this post won't merely obfuscate matters by my poor ability to define the term. But, according to Tomas's last post, I'm having a harder time seeing where he disagrees with me.<br/>Except, of course, some of the things he puts in Designer's Tool-box are actually not the designer's to affect, but the group's. I too have been a proponent of Social Contract and mood governed by mechanics, but we're not there yet. I see the advice used in rule-books an easy way to help give the starting push for mood/social behaviour in games, but ultimately a cop-out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_153070">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153070/#Comment_153070" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-26T02:43:45+00:00" title="June 26, 2008  2:43AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 26, 2008 2:44AM by TomasHVM.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Guy: the problem about doing the "mechanics for me" thing is that mechanics got a very down to earth and strong meaning with most gamers.

I am<i><b>not</b></i>talking of the limited tools present in one specific game. To make games that strive to achieve depth through<i>narrow focus</i>is indeed my preferred mode of design these days.</blockquote>\nThank you for contrasting the difference between the designer and the implementation in a specific game.  That said, I find the skills of a designer to be meaningless as a player.  I am only interested in the play produced by an actual game.   It's certainly good for a game designer to have a multitude of skills available, but I can't play their skills until they put them into an actual game.<br/><br/>Here's where I see "Until we Sink" to fall short:  There is no intersection between the advice on how to play the game and the actual procedures you go through during game play.  The advice says the game is supposed to be about explaining unknown and mysterious events in a way that is interesting and/or tension filled.  However the actual procedures of play encourage the conversation to cover any topic whatsoever.<br/><br/>What many here are advocating for are designs where the type of play desire is <i>emergent</i> from following the procedures of play.  Where the themes addressed grow organically from the game procedures itself rather than are imposed artificially with play advice with no grounding in actual game procedures.  In short, a game chocked full of advice is poor game design that relies on imposing a type of play rather than having it naturally grow out of play.  Also remember that procedures/mechanics in RPGs include social interaction, verbal exchanges, acting and discourse.<br/><br/>A game that has specific points in play where expression is to be carried out to address the specific themes of the game is vastly superior in producing a specific type of play to one that does not have these specific points and simply advises the players to somehow include such practices sometime.<br/><br/>"Until we sink" has this exact problem.  There is <i>one</i> point in the entire play experience where the procedures of the game tell you to address the main point of the game.  <b>And even at this one point, there is still no procedure for how to actually include it, but simply a rule that play cannot cease until you do include it.</b>\n<blockquote><br/><b>The game</b>should have a limited and focused tool-set, for the GM/players to use.<br/><b>The designer</b>should have a tool-box of all-sorts, to facilitate his design-choices.</blockquote>\nNo disagreement with that.  I would add a third though:<br/><b>The game</b> should have procedures that produce the type of play envisioned by the designer.\n<blockquote>Any game is bigger than the sum of its elements, Matthew. The elements are building blocks of a<i>method,</i>and how the method works is revealed in play. </blockquote>\nNo game produces play outside of following the procedures of the game unless the group playing it tacks on its own procedures.  Advice can encourage this, but what such advice is essentially doing is leaving the game design for the missing procedures up to the players.  This is very poor and lazy game design.\n<blockquote>I do<b>not</b>assume that you can understand and appreciate the effects of all of the techniques in the example game. I have repeatedly failed to do so myself in game after game, and i am fairly experienced in the field (as a designer and professional RPG-consultant).</blockquote>\nI generally like to function with the idea that just because I am not capable of doing something, that does not mean no one else is either.  My limitations don't necessarily apply to other people.\n<blockquote>I have played this game, and the experience has changed how I think about RPG-design altogether. It is one of several modern designs that has made a mark in the rapid development of RPGs these days, and for me it is THE most groundbreaking of them all.</blockquote>\nThis same sort of "ground breaking" moment occured in the 90s with the same type of play.  At the time it was born out of the assumption that mechanics could never produce a given desired type of play.  Many free-form games were played and many groups converted their mechanically focused games into free form games by slicing out large portions of the mechanics and replace them with hand-waving as a form of resolution and a concentration on dialogue, discourse and verbal interaction without any connection between those techniques and the procedures of play.<br/><br/>To be perfectly honest, you are saying the exact same things they did, but you're 10-15 years late.  You've even said that players of a certain games (D&amp;D specifically) need to be "rescued" from them.  I'm half expecting to see you tell use to concentrate on role playing rather than roll playing any minute.<br/><br/>This "methodical" approach to design is just a rehashing of what's already been tried. <b> The real innovation comes when one realizes that these same dramatic techniques can be grounded right in the procedures of play in the actual game rules and not left to ephemeral advice that is disconnected from the procedures one actually goes through in play.</b><br/><br/>I can see the potential for a redesign of "Until we sink" that takes every point of advice and connects it with an actual game procedure so that playing the actual game will produce the type of play desired without the players having to build and add their own procedures to do so.<br/><br/>Basically this "methodical" approach where the designer advises a certain type of play is basically the offering of incomplete games where the players then have to come up with procedures to implement the advice of the designer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153083">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SweeneyTodd" title="SweeneyTodd"><img alt="SweeneyTodd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SweeneyTodd">SweeneyTodd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153083/#Comment_153083" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-26T06:09:22+00:00" title="June 26, 2008  6:09AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 26, 2008 6:11AM by SweeneyTodd.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Matthew,<br/><br/>I'm having trouble following your argument, to the extent that I'm reading you as saying "A game needs advice to connect it to an actual game procedure" and I'm reading Tomas as saying the same thing with different words. But hey, I'll follow along as best I can. <br/><br/>It's like, you're saying "It's not a complete game because you run it using 'advice'" and Tomas is saying "I'm trying to think of ways to make this stuff more than just 'advice'", and so I can't see where your point of contention is! I mean, if Tomas is about trying to "beef up" rules of something like <i>Sink</i> to be more method-based, and you think <i>Sink</i> sucks because it's not mechanics-based, isn't there some common point of agreement you guys can find there? Maybe in the discussion of how mechanics and methods interact?<br/><br/>Anyway, this may not be the same argument as the one you guys are having, but I wanted to raise this point:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: M Eryesen</cite>Basically this "methodical" approach where the designer advises a certain type of play is basically the offering of incomplete games where the players then have to come up with procedures to implement the advice of the designer.</blockquote>\nI could make this counterargument by changing the wording:<br/><br/>"Basically the  "mechanical" approach where the designer advises a certain type of play and then provides mechanical subsystems that fail to implement fully that kind of play, is offering incomplete games where the players then have to come up with procedures to bridge the mechanical subsystems and the advice of the designer."<br/><br/>I'd contend that that includes most traditional RPGs; if a game provides mechanical subsystems for let's say, task resolution, combat, magic, and finding traps, and then bills itself as "A game of heroic fantasy", and the DM's guide contains advice on what your rollickin' adventure should look like... I think the group has to do exactly the same kind of "heavy lifting" that they do with something like <i>Until We Sink</i>! <br/><br/>Another simple example: Any traditional RPG that doesn't have rules for scene framing is one where the players have to come up with procedures to implement the rest of the game. <br/><br/>What I'm getting at is that I don't think there exists a game where there isn't some bridging of the game rules into the methods (to use Tomas' phrasing) used to actually play that game. So yes, D&amp;D tells you how to handle a lot of the various things you'll do in a dungeon, but what does it give you in terms of "Here is how we explore the dungeon?"<br/><br/>Looking at Basic D&amp;D, I see the 10-minute turn and a back-and-forth between party and GM deciding what rooms they'll explore and such, and indications to invoke mechanical subsystems such as combat when appropriate. So it's like<br/><br/><i>Per turn</i><br/>- DM describes what the party can see<br/>- Party indicates what they are doing (move, examine, attack, etc.)<br/>- DM adjudicates what happens, based on mechanical subsystems<br/><br/>Compare that to the breakdown Matthew did with <i>Until We Sink</i>, and I don't see much of a difference. Yeah, Sink doesn't contain as many subsystems, but I view "You cannot move on to the next scene until this card is explained in this scene through play" and "The fight ends when the goblin is reduced to zero HP" as fundamentally the same kinds of rules. Continuing this analogy, I view "But you can't really tell whether or not that has actually been explained, the rules don't tell you what that means!" as the same kind of thing as "But I should have gotten the +1 hit bonus for size, or terrain, or..." -- these are differences of opinion that must be resolved by folks at the table before play can continue. Every game has those kinds of things happen where a judgement call is needed.<br/><br/>Sorry to go into so much length, but I wanted to try to focus on the bone of contention here and see if it can be moved past. If you guys just want to say "Tomas, Sink isn't a real RPG", I don't see how that's a supportable argument, to the extent that we all agree that freeform roleplay is still "a RPG" or if it's actually "played", and if that common ground doesn't exist it should really be stated as such.<br/><br/>Or if instead if it's instead about debating what words like "play" and "roleplaying game" mean, let me know, so I can haul ass out of this thread!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SweeneyTodd" title="SweeneyTodd"><img alt="SweeneyTodd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SweeneyTodd">SweeneyTodd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153084/#Comment_153084" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-26T06:25:44+00:00" title="June 26, 2008  6:25AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 26, 2008 6:35AM by SweeneyTodd.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, let me take a different tack. If this doesn't make sense with you the reader using different definitions for these words than me, say so and let's hammer it out. (Again, only stating my opinions, of course, I know no objective truth, about RPGs anyway.)<br/><br/>Therre is a lot of "stuff" in a roleplaying game text. In any session of play, the group takes this stuff and plays a game. In this game, they generally are doing some things that are described in the book, may be doing some things that are suggested by the book, and are doing yet other things that aren't contained in the book at all.<br/><br/>Some games (say GURPS, HERO, D&amp;D) provide "stuff" about how to resolve tasks and fights. To some extent, this stuff focuses on objects and beings in a Shared Imagined Space, and how to adjudicate interactions between these objects. <br/><br/>Some games (say The Shadow of Yesterday or Sorcerer) provide this stuff, as well as stuff about how the at-table play addresses the Shared Imagined Space (such as scene-framing rules). Here I'm intentionally grouping in TSOY (a game with "rules" for scene framing" with Sorcerer (one that provides the rule "The GM frames scenes" and then gives a lot of what you might call advice about how to do so).<br/><br/>Some games (say Until We Sink) don't provide any of the stuff that the first category does -- no in-text guidance on how to determine who wins a fist-fight, for example). They provide other stuff, which it seems some people would view as "just advice" and not "rules", but it's still stuff, and it indicates how play progresses.<br/><br/>Basically, different games provide different "stuff" for the group to use. This stuff gets used in different ways, and may or may not affect whether the game <i>as played</i> resembles the game that the designer was envisioning when he wrote this stuff.<br/><br/>So... with me deliberately avoiding definition debate by using the word "stuff" = "things in the game text that can be used by the group to determine the course of play", does anyone have any issues with how I've phrased this?<br/><br/>If not, moving on, I think the really interesting meaty discussion that I'm longing for is not "How can we decide which of this stuff is called X versus Y or Z", but rather "How does this 'stuff' actually shape the course of play?" Is it possible to just ignore for a bit the subtaxonomy of this stuff into (mechanics, method, process, advice, art, whatever)? Or maybe it isn't, I don't know.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153086">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SweeneyTodd" title="SweeneyTodd"><img alt="SweeneyTodd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SweeneyTodd">SweeneyTodd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153086/#Comment_153086" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-26T06:54:52+00:00" title="June 26, 2008  6:54AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 26, 2008 7:08AM by SweeneyTodd.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, last post for a bit. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Here I'll try to express what I get from what Tomas is saying, and why I'm interested in pursuing more discussion on it (as opposed to defending that it's "correct" or whatever.)<br/><br/>My wife's only roleplayed in groups that I've run, except for one game where someone else GMed for our group. She's never read a rulebook, she's bored silly by them. She has no problem with using traditional mechanics, but her sole interest in them is their introduction of the unexpected. Any idea that the shared imagined space must be rigorously simulated is greeted by a laugh from her. "You all are imagining it together, so consensus is all that matters," she'd say.<br/><br/>She's extremely good with things like intuitively understanding social contexts, figuring out where in a hierarchy she needs to put pressure to get something done, etc. She is a social animal. She's also extremely good with procedures, to the point where she's unhappy at work unless she's got opportunities to refine and optimize them.<br/><br/>When she talks about rules, her take is "It really doesn't matter what mechanics you use; 90% of the game is determined by who's running it and how they structure play." And while I'm a mechanics-monkey, I was struck that her assessment was totally correct for our group, and for any past group I've been in. So that got me interested in looking at what a game might look like that was written "in her language", so to speak. <br/><br/>Having read <i>Until We Sink</i>, I feel I could run that for our roleplaying group. There wouldn't be any confusion as to what to do next or how play would progress. Would it play differently from something like FATE or D&amp;D? Probably -- I hope it would, it's trying to do different stuff. But it'd still be recognizable as a roleplaying game. More importantly to me, <i>my wife</i> could recognize it as a roleplaying game text, as opposed to my collection of D&amp;D books which only serve as a flat writing surface to her. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>(Full disclosure: She hasn't read <i>Sink</i>. The game she picked out and went off on "Hey, this is how a damn RPG should be written" was <a href="http://jeepen.org/games/soap/" rel="nofollow">the Jeepform Soap Opera game.</a> But these games are clearly similar in structure and presentation.)<br/><br/>From her perspective, the "stuff" (rules/advice/whatever) in <i>Sink</i> is more clearly written and more actually useful in play than anything in a D&amp;D book. It's applicable to actually playing the game. For her, "Introduce a conflict between your character and a relative" is a much clearer rule than "Roll d20 + BAB + mods vs AC". <br/><br/>So my personal interest (apart from just diving in and playing those kinds of games with her, which sounds fun if out of my comfort zone), is figuring out a way to write rules that actually have some mechanical "crunch" to them (not much, but a little) that will engage her brain at the same time. Making mechanics out of methods, if you will. (One place I've seen it work very well for us is Fate's Aspect system, where personality/character elements can provide either a mechanical benefit to a task relevant to the Aspect, or cause complications related to that Aspect. I find it particularly interesting that an "Aspect compel" is very similar to the Jeepform "GM speaks to you as your inner monologue" type of thing, but you get a mechanical benefit for going along with it. That seems a fruitful ground to explore -- maybe I should try to write a FATE Jeepform that uses only Aspects.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153102">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/M%20Eryesen" title="M Eryesen"><img alt="M Eryesen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/M%20Eryesen">M Eryesen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153102/#Comment_153102" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-26T08:28:57+00:00" title="June 26, 2008  8:28AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 26, 2008 8:50AM by M Eryesen.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome posts, Andrew.  Tons and tons of stuff in there.  I'll definitely be getting to them when I have time to do it justice.  But I will start with the first section.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: SweeneyTodd</cite>I'm having trouble following your argument, to the extent that I'm reading you as saying "A game needs advice to connect it to an actual game procedure" and I'm reading Tomas as saying the same thing with different words. But hey, I'll follow along as best I can.</blockquote>\nBasically I'm saying that a set of rules should tell you how to play.  They should tell you to do X, then Y, then Z, etc.,.  And if you follow the procedures of play you'll directly address the themes of the game and produce play of type A.  Such addressing of themes through play will emmerge/grow out of following the procedures of the game.<br/><br/>This is in contrast to the "advice-centric" method that Tomas is talking about.  In such games as Sinking, the designer simply says "try to make the game about X" and "be sure to be ruthless" or "don't object too much."  But then fails to provide any game procedures to guide or give opportunity for the players to follow the advice.  Rather than having what the game is about emmerge/grow from actual play, the players are supposed to impose it on the play despite/regardless of the actual procedures of the game.<br/><br/><i>Sink</i> is supposed to be about explaining mysterious events.  It has procedures for events to occur (the drawing of the cards and reading them) but no procedures for making sure events ever get explained until the very end of the game.  And even then, there's no actual procedure for ensuring such explanations actually occur except to say that the game cannot conclude until you do.<br/><br/>A simple procedure that one could add would be that someone in the conversation (whoever's turn it might be-- however you want to determine that) must bring up the event read from the card during the conversation and whomever responds to that player must supply a fact towards the explanation.  Even if that was all that was done and the rest of the conversation was about the mating habits of the duck billed thissle wren, at least there'd be some headway made towards actually doing what the game is supposed to be about.  The game would then actually have a procedure for the players to address the main point of the game instead of leaving it all up to whatever.  Not the most thrilling procedure, but certainly a greater focus on producing a desired type of play than demanding the players figure it out and hopefully produce the desired type of play.<br/><br/>Now a simple retort to that would be to say that players shouldn't need that kind of direction.  That any method they choose to get around to explaining an event is just fine and that it's just fine if they don't until the end.  If that is the case, then what game you play doesn't matter at all as the group can just figure it out.  I don't think this is the case.  Neither do I agree with your wife that it is 90% the group and only 10% the individual game.<br/><br/>Sink is supposed to be about these explanations of mysterious events, about startling revelations, about motives and creating tension but does nothing to help make this stuff happen other than to say to the players "hey guys, talk about it."\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: SweeneyTodd</cite>I could make this counterargument by changing the wording:<br/><br/>"Basically the  "mechanical" approach where the designer advises a certain type of play and then provides mechanical subsystems that fail to implement fully that kind of play, is offering incomplete games where the players then have to come up with procedures to bridge the mechanical subsystems and the advice of the designer."<br/><br/>I'd contend that that includes most traditional RPGs; if a game provides mechanical subsystems for let's say, task resolution, combat, magic, and finding traps, and then bills itself as "A game of heroic fantasy", and the DM's guide contains advice on what your rollickin' adventure should look like... I think the group has to do exactly the same kind of "heavy lifting" that they do with something like<i>Until We Sink</i>!<br/></blockquote>\nI completely agree.  Many traditional/resolution mechanic focused games also lack the procedures needed to produce the play talked about in the books.  I don't disagree with your counter argument at all.  I think it's bang on and is essentially saying the same thing:<br/><br/>Games should have procedures that produce the type of play desired.  Not a bunch of die rolling for stuff not connected with the goals of the game.  Not a bunch of hand waving and advice for players to "just include it" or "just be ruthless", but instead,  actual procedures of play that make the game produce the type of play desired (whatever that may be).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SweeneyTodd" title="SweeneyTodd"><img alt="SweeneyTodd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SweeneyTodd">SweeneyTodd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153109/#Comment_153109" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-26T08:48:44+00:00" title="June 26, 2008  8:48AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool, I'm glad to know we're on the same page -- I know I mixed a lot of "Please don't misinterpret" crap in with what I was trying to say, it was kinda defensive. Sounds like we can mostly  ignore it. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I think the "advice centric" versus "process centric" distinction is good. Trying to figure out mechanics that could satisfy two groups of people, each of which relates better to one of those approaches rather than the other, would be extremely useful, I think. Or, as you said it:<br/><br/>Games should have procedures that produce the type of play desired. Not a bunch of die rolling for stuff not connected with the goals of the game. Not a bunch of hand waving and advice for players to "just include it" or "just be ruthless", but instead, actual procedures of play that make the game produce the type of play desired (whatever that may be).<br/><br/>I don't find a game that has "hand waving and advice" to be unplayable... but many people will, and reaching them would be cool.<br/><br/>Off the top of my head I can think of two different ways to transmute guidance and process:<br/><br/>- Formalize guidance into process<br/>- Abstract process into guidance<br/><br/>There are probably more, and those are pretty huge things in themselves. I'm just pondering what's different between the two, and it's a lot of things -- specificity, for one. Detail? Explicit allowance for exceptions, and exception handling? <br/><br/>Or to be more specific, you might have "just be ruthless", you might have mechanics that encourage ruthless behavior, you might have mechanics that require ruthless behavior, or "If you have the Ruthless disadvantage you should act ruthlessly X times per session".... there's a large scope of possible approaches.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153112">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/M%20Eryesen" title="M Eryesen"><img alt="M Eryesen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/M%20Eryesen">M Eryesen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153112/#Comment_153112" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-26T08:50:22+00:00" title="June 26, 2008  8:50AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 26, 2008 8:59AM by M Eryesen.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry about picking at things out of order, but this really caught my eye:\n<blockquote>(Full disclosure: She hasn't read Sink. The game she picked out and went off on "Hey, this is how a damn RPG should be written" was the Jeepform Soap Opera game. But these games are clearly similar in structure and presentation.)</blockquote>\nNow this game is just popping with procedures.  It <i>even has flow charts</i> with decision points.  Procedures about blocks of dialogue, breaks, etc.,.  It has rules about when you can enter and exit scenes.  It has a role for the director in scene framing.  How many scenes per block of time each character can appear in.  It has a procedure for players to say what they want a given scene to be about and a rule to ensure everyone gets one where they say what it's about.<br/><br/>Compared to Sinking, this game is <i>pregnant</i> with procedures geared towards creating the kind of play the game is about.  It seems to me the author looked at the characteristics of soap operas and designed play to mimic them (or their structure at the very least).  The only thing it's missing in my mind would be a procedure to produce soap opera type conflicts of interest and flow of information.  Here again, the game gives some example play and gives a primer on soap operas but leaves the players to their own devices to produce soap opera type dialogue.  I think a simple add on might be rules for secrets and information flow rather than hoping it all works out in dialogue.  <br/><br/>For example, imagine adding something that colours a scene in a certain way.  So a player might want a scene "talking about the rich Aunt's last will and testament with Rolf" but some sort of system then also adds "and a character who opposes your character eavesdrops on your conversation.  Figure out who that is by doing X.  After every exchange back and forth, the eavesdropping player must make a monologue about something they heard.  This could be as short as going "oh!" or as long as the development of a plan of action or a monolgue of exultation or despair."  A procedure like that could help actually create a scene very common to soap operas.<br/><br/>That's just a sample off the top of my head.  The game has lots of procedures for producing the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">structure</span> of a soap opera, but I feel it is also another example of a game that leaves it to the players to hopefully produce soap opera type dialogue within that structure.  It's also missing procedures to make sure soap opera play grows out of or emerges from play and instead asks the players to impose it on the dialogue.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SweeneyTodd" title="SweeneyTodd"><img alt="SweeneyTodd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SweeneyTodd">SweeneyTodd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153113/#Comment_153113" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-26T08:54:21+00:00" title="June 26, 2008  8:54AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 26, 2008 9:01AM by SweeneyTodd.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            referring to the Soap Opera game:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: M Eryesen</cite><br/>Now this game is just pregnant with procedures.

Seeing you compare it with Until We Sink made me feel like I really got what you were talking about. Thanks!<br/><br/>Tomas, I'd be really interested in your input here. Matthew seems to view <i>Soap</i> and <i>Sink</i> as very different approaches to the rules, and I absolutely see his point. What's your opinion on this? <br/><br/>Specifically, tell me if this random guess has any merit: I think that <i>Sink</i> implies the use of some Jeepform "core methods" that <i>Soap</i> formally states. If that is the case, then I totally think that's part of the disconnect. The Soap Opera game is honestly the only Jeepform game I understood what it was trying to do the first time I read it.<br/><br/>And if this means you'd think I or someone else in the thread don't really "get" Jeepform yet -- awesome! That indicates to me that any text is read in context, which is head-slappingly obvious but not something I've really considered in this thread before. You've got the context of the genre or "school" of game the text is categorized in, the context of the group playing and their past methods, even sometimes the context of the name of the game itself (the new Dungeons &amp; Dragons has this issue in spades -- there are a lot of things one might have done when running it in past versions that will have very different results in the new one, but the text doesn't really discuss this).<br/><br/>If I'm on the right track, then maybe comparing <i>Sink</i> to <i>Soap</i> would be fruitful to continue. I'll read them both over and mull on it some more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html

SweeneyTodd</cite>I think that<i>Sink</i>implies the use of some Jeepform "core methods" that<i>Soap</i>formally states.</blockquote>\nThis could totally be the case.  It could be that Sink is incomplete without a separate core methods book that actually gives you the procedures needed to play.  Maybe Sink + Core Jeepform Methodbook is a complete game with procedures that produce the desired type of play.  But just with Sink, I'm not seeing it.<br/><br/>The main thing I see both Sink and Soap missing are procedures to make sure the dialogue is about or of the type of what the game is actually about.  Soap operas, for example, have certain classic/cliched scenes.  Procedures to make sure these scenes happen could be amazingly useful in helping the players actually make the game produce what it is supposed to.  Andrew, do you have any thoughts about the lack of such rules and the leaving of it to dialogue with the only other thing pushing you in that direction being some advice text that says "play it like this primer on soap operas"?<br/><br/>A deck of cards with things like "the eavesdropping scene", "the stunning revelation", "who's the father?", "the secret crush", "she might be pregnant" and "I'm secretly your enemy but I have to pretend to be on your side" on them might be a powerful aid to the game to provide a procedure the rules themselves lack.  Thoughts?<br/><br/>Also, I'd like to add that while I may be tossing out ideas for procedures to produce a certain type of play, I'm not necessarily saying they're good but am providing them as examples of the type of thing I could see as helping to produce a certain type of play.<br/><br/>There are still a few things from your great 3 post salvo that I might comment on, but I think we're pretty much understanding each other at this point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153136">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153136/#Comment_153136" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-26T10:33:56+00:00" title="June 26, 2008 10:33AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 26, 2008 11:26AM by Thunder_God.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andrew, a short point regarding the counter-argument:<br/>Whereas it seems Tomas's methods rely on these advice-based designs, and hail them.<br/>The difference is while we mechanic-proponent designers do produce games where the sub-systems do not create the feeling we desire wholly, we accept that as our failing, we do not say that we've reached our goal.<br/>He seems to be aiming towards it, we are aiming beyond it, but currently cannot fulfill our visions.<br/><br/>There's a very important difference.<br/><br/>Edit: Also, I have serious issues with D&amp;D for exactly those reasons you've made, but I plan to explore them in the coming month or two on my <a href="http://competitiverpgs.wordpress.com" rel="nofollow">blog</a>.<br/><br/>Edit 2: I may or may not address some of the other points Andrew made, I'm not sure they're really necessary.

Where the themes addressed grow organically from the game procedures itself rather than are imposed artificially with play advice with no grounding in actual game procedures.</blockquote>\nSeems to me you are trying to impose a set of rules that do not go well with the reality of game-design. The reality is that games like Sink has been made, and functions very well. Time to redraw the map?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: M Eryesen</cite>This same sort of "ground breaking" moment occured in the 90s with the same type of play.  At the time it was born out of the assumption that mechanics could never produce a given desired type of play.  Many free-form games were played and many groups converted their mechanically focused games into free form games by slicing out large portions of the mechanics and replace them with hand-waving as a form of resolution and a concentration on dialogue, discourse and verbal interaction without any connection between those techniques and the procedures of play.</blockquote>The descriptive part of this is right; a reaction towards heavy mechanics took place back then, only for my part it took place in the late eighties. The claim that it was the same thing is false. Far from it.<br/><br/>But I see now that you argue from a history I do not share. The development in Norway has been different from that in USA and England. We have maintained the drive to play outside of the mechanics-paradigm that you advocate so strongly, and at the same time we have developed mechanics that are superior to the old stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_153178">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153178/#Comment_153178" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-26T12:39:08+00:00" title="June 26, 2008 12:39PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 26, 2008 12:39PM by TomasHVM.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: M Eryesen</cite>This "methodical" approach to design is just a rehashing of what's already been tried.<b>The real innovation comes when one realizes that these same dramatic techniques can be grounded right in the procedures of play in the actual game rules and not left to ephemeral advice that is disconnected from the procedures one actually goes through in play.</b></blockquote>I am with you on the emphasis of how the gameplay should rise from the <i>method</i>. I do however, see that <i>method </i>may be built in a multitude of ways. You seem to be oblivious to that fact. Sorry to point this out again: <b>It is a fact; games have been built that functions very, very well by means you deem to be dysfunctional. It does not add up! Face the facts!</b><br/><br/><i><b>M Eryesen wrote: </b>the "advice-centric" method that Tomas is talking about.<br/><b>Thunder_God wrote: </b>Tomas's methods rely on these advice-based designs, and hail them.</i><br/>- Both of you are wrong here. I do not advocate design that "rely on advice" or design that are "advice-centric". That is your invention! I must insist on being met with real arguments, not false rewritings of what I stand for.<br/><br/>I advocate <b>a toolbox for designers that includes more</b> than the mechanical tools you are locked on to. Even though you seem to be expanding on what is a "mechanic" all the time, I maintain that your position is narrow, and not in keeping with the actual landscape of modern design. Mechanics are part of my toolbox. Classical RPGs are part of the design-possibilities I talk about. But more so: the tools available in a method based thinking are far more complex and flexible than anything you may dream up by sheer mechanics alone.<br/><br/>A while back I talked about this as a shift of paradigm in RPGs. Your inability to comprehend the simple facts I am talking about makes me think in that direction again. Perhaps the modern design-paradigm is so totally out of your framework of thought, that it is incomprehensible to you ...<br/><br/>I do not mean to diminish your insights on RPGs and the design of them. I do see that much of your ideas are sound. But I am talking about a larger picture, where your ideas form only part of the tools available.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: M Eryesen (on Soap)</cite>Now this game is just popping with procedures.  It<i>even has flow charts</i>with decision points.  Procedures about blocks of dialogue, breaks, etc.,.  It has rules about when you can enter and exit scenes.  It has a role for the director in scene framing.  How many scenes per block of time each character can appear in.  It has a procedure for players to say what they want a given scene to be about and a rule to ensure everyone gets one where they say what it's about.</blockquote>Matthijs Holter made a remark about a year ago, that he found most American indie-games to have mechanics that was nice in themselves, but repeatedly he experienced that they got in the way of interaction and immersion. He stated that even though he had been an advocate for "Forge-games" for years, he now found that the developments here in Norway was far more promising.<br/><br/>I agree with him.<br/><br/>His statement also point to some very important differences in these design-cultures. The differences seems to surface in this discussion. I find it peculiar, although not unexpected, to see such heavy emphasis on mechanics in a discussion on RPG-design on this side of year 2000, especially in light of the actual games (there are more than Sink) that escape your "shackles" and creates fun in other ways.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153184">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153184/#Comment_153184" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-26T12:54:09+00:00" title="June 26, 2008 12:54PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 26, 2008 12:57PM by Eric.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<img alt="image" src="http://pics.livejournal.com/twoflower/pic/000858cz"/><br/><br/>edit: intended to apply to both sides                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_153193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153193/#Comment_153193" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-26T13:22:54+00:00" title="June 26, 2008  1:22PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 26, 2008 1:26PM by TomasHVM.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>"The positive existential proclamation bears the burden of proof"</i> is written in the text Eric sites.<br/><br/>I kind of agree, and so I give a game as "proof" for my claims.

She's never read a rulebook, she's bored silly by them. She has no problem with using traditional mechanics, but her sole interest in them is their introduction of the unexpected. Any idea that the shared imagined space must be rigorously simulated is greeted by a laugh from her. "You all are imagining it together, so consensus is all that matters," she'd say.<br/><br/>She's extremely good with things like intuitively understanding social contexts, figuring out where in a hierarchy she needs to put pressure to get something done, etc. She is a social animal. She's also extremely good with procedures, to the point where she's unhappy at work unless she's got opportunities to refine and optimize them.<br/><br/>When she talks about rules, her take is "It really doesn't matter what mechanics you use; 90% of the game is determined by who's running it and how they structure play." And while I'm a mechanics-monkey, I was struck that her assessment was totally correct for our group, and for any past group I've been in. So that got me interested in looking at what a game might look like that was written "in her language", so to speak.<br/><br/>Having read<i>Until We Sink</i>, I feel I could run that for our roleplaying group. There wouldn't be any confusion as to what to do next or how play would progress. Would it play differently from something like FATE or D&amp;D? Probably -- I hope it would, it's trying to do different stuff. But it'd still be recognizable as a roleplaying game. More importantly to me,<i>my wife</i>could recognize it as a roleplaying game text, as opposed to my collection of D&amp;D books which only serve as a flat writing surface to her. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>(Full disclosure: She hasn't read<i>Sink</i>. The game she picked out and went off on "Hey, this is how a damn RPG should be written" was<a href="http://jeepen.org/games/soap/" rel="nofollow">the Jeepform Soap Opera game.</a>But these games are clearly similar in structure and presentation.)<br/><br/>From her perspective, the "stuff" (rules/advice/whatever) in<i>Sink</i>is more clearly written and more actually useful in play than anything in a D&amp;D book. It's applicable to actually playing the game. For her, "Introduce a conflict between your character and a relative" is a much clearer rule than "Roll d20 + BAB + mods vs AC".(...)</blockquote>Hi! Just wanted to say thanks for the notes on your wife's approach to gaming. It exactly matches my own. Bored to death by the math-stuff in the traditional RPG rulebooks, still been enormously fascinated by RPGs since I was ten. Exactly for the reasons you mention. It also was a fairly exact phrasing on some thoughts and feelings I've had on the whole indie/traditional/Story Game/Nordic scene-soup, without me being able to phrase them properly. Especially not in English.<br/><br/>I'm a Norwegian game designer too, and me and Martin's game "Itra's City" uses the concept of <a href="http://norwegianstyle.wordpress.com/2007/12/06/itras-city-two-decks/" rel="nofollow">impro-style cards</a> as it's sole mechanic. The rest of the book just consists of setting description and advice on how to facilitate interaction in the group. (I try to use the words in the previous sentences in a commonsensical way as to avoid being entangled in the semantics debate going on here) Seems to work. We're launching the game in these days, have had a fair amount of press. I'm up a bit too early in the morning right now, in advance of a Con this weekend were our game is the theme.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.itrasby.no" rel="nofollow">Here</a> are the webpages for the game (alas, in the Norwegian, but there is a trailer, some nice pictures and stuff if you browse around a bit.<br/><br/>As for Until We Sink "not being a role playing game".... No. I'm trying to make a principle out of staying away from definition debates on the web. Especially in languages not my mother tongue.<br/><br/>As another aside, thanks to elmago79 for the info on the Spanish games. Sounds like fun, and a good way to brush up on one's Spanish. Do you know if there are any games set to South America? Preferably in the 19th Century?

I don't see how this is relevant (games are not fun), but if you do, that would go a long way to explain what you want from games and how you understand them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/olepeder" title="olepeder"><img alt="olepeder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/olepeder">olepeder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153505/#Comment_153505" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-28T01:36:53+00:00" title="June 28, 2008  1:36AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>There's a lot of focus on fun in this thread.

The idea is that fun is not a defining feature of games. Playing games can be fun, and it often is, but the presence or absence of fun is only relevant if we're trying to figure out what someone's idea of fun is...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153619">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SweeneyTodd" title="SweeneyTodd"><img alt="SweeneyTodd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SweeneyTodd">SweeneyTodd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153619/#Comment_153619" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-28T18:25:59+00:00" title="June 28, 2008  6:25PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 28, 2008 6:30PM by SweeneyTodd.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (I sheepishly return to the thread.)<br/><br/>olepeder: Thanks for your thoughts! I think there's probably a lot of folks I know personally who would share your or my wife's preferred approach to gaming; I'd like to be able to connect with those folks better. So that helps out. Thanks in particular for the Itra's City link; I've tried one freeform session where we used Tarot cards to inform what would happen next, but it felt a bit unfocused for us, so something like those cards looks very interesting to me.<br/><br/>lemon:\n<blockquote>Playing games can be fun, and it often is, but the presence or absence of fun is only relevant if we're trying to figure out what someone's idea of fun is...</blockquote>\nThat's interesting, but I think if fun isn't part of the definition of "game" that's even more of a reason to not get hung up debating whether X or Y is a game. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> The thread started with an eye on examining how texts can create a particular process flow, so to speak, at the gaming table (converting text to actual play and how that happens.) I definatly think "whether it's fun" is relevant to that issue, so I'll happily stick to including fun in the conversation. (As to where I'm coming from, I'm mostly focused on the idea of how "stuff that some people don't consider a game" can be mined for use in other games. So when people say X isn't a game, I don't care about refuting that, I think that there's stuff in the non-game process or whatever that's applicable to a "proper game".)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6837/methodical-and-mechanical-rpg-design" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6837/methodical-and-mechanical-rpg-design" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6837/methodical-and-mechanical-rpg-design/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F6837%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F6837%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
