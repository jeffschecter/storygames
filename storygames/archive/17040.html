I don't get hurt feelings about stuff like this, so no sweat there. Also, here's some unabashed praise: I think that Misery Tourism Games is really cool. I dig your mission statement, your games are interesting and provocative, and I hope you have serious success. This shouldn't surprise anybody at all.<br/><br/>When you design a game, you naturally have an audience in mind, and you design a game that you think they'll be drawn to. What do you do if your audience doesn't seize upon the game you've designed for them? <br/><br/>You have to figure out (a) whether your game <i>can</i> hold their attention in the first place, and if you're confident it can, (b) how to get it there. It's competing for your audience's attention with other games, and they enjoy some advantages yours don't - they always do! - so you have to figure out how to make your game competitive. You can't expect your audience to indulge you or your fellow designers to give you a break, that's not their job, it's yours.<br/><br/>Complaining at your audience for not paying attention to the games you wish they would (including yours) is a marketing technique you can use if you want, but I've never seen it work well. I can tell you that when I tried it on behalf of a friend's game, <a href="http://lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=325" rel="nofollow">here</a>, it didn't seem to help. I think it made more bad will than good. <br/><br/>So that's my thought: you can't expect an audience to stop liking what they like. In the case of excellent games like Monsterhearts (ha ha go frack yourselves!) you <i>shouldn't</i> expect them to. No, to win an audience over, you have to win it over.<br/><br/>-Vincent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387388">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB" title="PeterBB"><img alt="PeterBB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB">PeterBB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387388/#Comment_387388" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-17T23:34:26+00:00" title="August 17, 2012 11:34PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 17, 2012 11:34PM by PeterBB.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Strings are definitely in my top 5 list of most innovative and valuable mechanical ideas of the past year or two.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_387395">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whduryea" title="whduryea"><img alt="whduryea" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v220/Nugan/noose755.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whduryea">whduryea</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387395/#Comment_387395" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-18T05:45:14+00:00" title="August 18, 2012  5:45AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 18, 2012 5:52AM by whduryea.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, I don't disagree with any of that.<br/><br/>I don't think anyone should feel obligated to enjoy my games or anyone else's.

I'll defend Monsterhearts (for instance) as a thoroughly and well designed game, every bit as sharp and innovative as a non-hack - Joe's pairing of subject matter with game design is astute and very fun to play. The one thing I think you missed talking about is that, hack or non-hack, we all build on the work of the designers before us.<br/><br/>-Vincent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_387405">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB" title="PeterBB"><img alt="PeterBB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB">PeterBB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387405/#Comment_387405" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-18T09:11:10+00:00" title="August 18, 2012  9:11AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This seems like a self-correcting problem, to be honest. Cut-and-paste jobs aren't going to be popular, because they aren't interesting. There are lots of hacks on the apocalypse-world.com forums that are getting basically no attention, because there's not much interesting in them. The ones that <i>are</i> popular are popular because they are really, really good. (Which usually involves some serious innovation.) Frankly, while I like the game to some extent, I think this is part of Monster of the Week's relative lack of attention: it didn't fall far enough from the tree.<br/><br/>It's baffling to me that you use Monsterhearts as your example, when it's an amazingly crafted game. If he had just copied-and-pasted, it would be a terrible game. But because he knew exactly what he was trying to design, he was able to copy on the rare occasions where it was possible, and innovate when necessary. (Like I said, Strings are as good an invention as anything I've seen in a non-hack game.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387409">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner" title="Evan_Torner"><img alt="Evan_Torner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/278/nHOYP3VNJB6A6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner">Evan_Torner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387409/#Comment_387409" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-18T11:16:31+00:00" title="August 18, 2012 11:16AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 18, 2012 11:19AM by Evan_Torner.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            2012:<br/>"Oh no, not ANOTHER <i>Apocalypse World</i> hack!

Why can't everyone be more creative?"<br/><br/>Or 1994:<br/>"Oh no, not ANOTHER stat+ability resolution game! Why can't everyone be more creative?"<br/><br/>Or 1984:<br/>"Oh no, not ANOTHER D&amp;D-like game that substitutes different arbitrary charts from Gygax's! Why can't everyone be more creative?"<br/><br/>In running <i>Monsterhearts</i>, I've discovered an entirely different game emergent than that of AW: one that rewards failure, insecurity and impulsive behavior.<br/><br/>I think our main issue with this current pattern in TRPG design is that it has a specific point of origin \u2013 Vincent Baker's <i>Apocalypse World</i> \u2013 and that hey! Vincent's just an ordinary bloke like you, me and your brother. What's so special about him?<br/><br/>But AW is such an intuitively useful tool in understanding TRPG design that we've learned a lot by seeing it in action, and generate Internet activity around it.<br/><br/>So fans of the pattern are using it to reboot/reinvent/restart genres which have been otherwise subjected to conventional mechanical solutions, while detractors focus on the fact that these reboots seem not to take the genre on its own mechanical terms beyond those of AW.<br/><br/>But Vincent appears to loom behind a framework that Joe McDalno, Adam Koebel and Sage LaTorra, Jonathan Walton, Elizabeth Sampat and, y'know, many others are <i>creatively</i> using to problem-solve player agency in genre TRPG interaction. These are mere appearances \u2013 you can still design whatever you want.<br/><br/>This AW-dominated indie development era too shall pass.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_387418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whduryea" title="whduryea"><img alt="whduryea" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v220/Nugan/noose755.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whduryea">whduryea</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387418/#Comment_387418" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-18T14:34:14+00:00" title="August 18, 2012  2:34PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's become clear that my karmic punishment for jumping to poorly informed conclusions will be to have this become a "cool things about Monsterhearts" thread.<br/><br/>(And, yeah, "cut-and-paste" is not a fair term for many of the better hacks, including the one we talked about in this episode.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387425">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387425/#Comment_387425" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-18T16:42:22+00:00" title="August 18, 2012  4:42PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>That said, it can be frustrating to play <a href="http://ingenero.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">original</a>, exciting games by new designers, and to see them get very little attention compared to hacks that sometimes seem like cut-and-paste jobs.

So we have been talking about them.<br/><br/>I might be out of line in bitching about hacks, but I'm not <i>just</i> bitching. I try to do everything I can to support other new designers with new ideas.

I just don't think it's fair to say that I'm not doing anything to promote or support these games. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387431">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387431/#Comment_387431" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-18T18:16:46+00:00" title="August 18, 2012  6:16PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure, but the podcast doesn't happen <i>here</i>. And if your podcast is about a game I don't know anything about, I have no reason to listen to it. And if I have to listen to a podcast I know nothing about before knowing what's going on in a thread, then I'm not reading the thread. I'm not saying you're doing nothing, but you sure aren't getting any info out to me. And while I'm nobody special or anything, if something finds a way to reach me it'll reach other people too. I bought the pdf of God-King based on the art alone, and from your link above, but where's the info about it? I looked at a review or two that were linked on that page, but in general, info was scarce. Good art, though.<br/><br/>So, like, a thread about "I played this game and here's how it went," I'll take a look at that, might be good. A thread about "I played this game and it does this one really cool thing, lemme tell you about it," I'll take a look at that too. But threads about podcasts usually just let me know there's a podcast.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_387458">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner" title="Evan_Torner"><img alt="Evan_Torner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/278/nHOYP3VNJB6A6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner">Evan_Torner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387458/#Comment_387458" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-19T00:04:54+00:00" title="August 19, 2012 12:04AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">@Johnstone</a> has some really good points about Internet positioning strategy. At the same time, I do sympathize with you <a href="/forums/profile/whduryea">@whduryea</a> about the underexposure dilemma. It turns out that we actually <i>do</i> exist in a star system, which is often counter-productive at circulating new ideas and alternative content. New things that come from the stars have an aura about them; new things from everyone else is either filtered out as noise or compared with the shadow of the stars' games. That being said, it's a sometimes very generous community, and people will definitely go to bat for you if you're willing to be transparent about your agendas, etc.<br/><br/>Also I've learned that occasionally low people on the totem pole have <i>way</i> more agency over their fate than they think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
