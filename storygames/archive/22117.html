                    I present to you the new <b><a href="https://teylen.blog/2019/06/02/crowdfunding-collection-108/" rel="nofollow">Crowdfunding Collection no. 108, including every tabletop project started between 05/27 and 06/02.</a></b><br/><br/>This collection contains a bunch of role-playing crowdfundings I am interested in. Like <b>Rust Hulks</b> which offers space exploration trucking style – a mixture of Alien, Firefly with parts of Star Wars – while being Powered by the Apocalypse. Which is an enticing combination. I am as well tempted by <b>Quietus</b>, a role-playing game that aims to provide „melancholic horror“ in the style of movies like Oculus or The Strangers. It’s fitted for smaller group of one to two players plus a GM and is designed to be experienced in One -Shots, system-wise it’s one of the first „Powered by the Dark“ systems – named after Blades in the Dark – I’ve noticed. Speaking of Blades, there is the <b>BLADE RPG</b>, while being a fantasy game I am still drawn in by the beautiful artwork, an interesting system and the sympathetic video presention.<br/><b>The StoryMaster’s Tales „Weirding Woods“</b> is the first of three… I’ll call ‚em „hybrid rpgs“. With Weirding Woods being more traditional and basically combinig tabletop rpg with board game elements in a fantasy setting. <b>Escape in the Dark</b> on the other hand provides a Science Fiction setting and offers an interesting mix of tabletop rpg, game book and Hands of Fate (the videogame, imho). Last but not least of the three is <b>CircleTales Adventures</b>, an interesting storytelling game in the more literal sense.<br/>If you like Larp and Poker, take a look at <b>The Deal</b> – which aims to bring both together. I personally do recommend the Patreon of <b>Blood on the Thames</b>. They do offer really cool V5 actual plays and I think their efforts deserve support. If you like The Dark Eye, the translation of the famous German rpg, you should considering checking the <b>Magic of Aventuria</b> sourcebook by Ulisses – from my understanding an integral part to the enjoyment of the setting and game.<br/>There are, of course, many more cool projects, just take a look:<br/><br/><b>English Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>3 Role-Playing Games<br/>3 Hybrid Role-Playing Games<br/>1 Larp<br/>1 Patreon<br/>2 Sourcebooks<br/>3 Adventures<br/>3 Dice Projects<br/>1 Accessoires<br/>1 Enamel Pin<br/>2 Map Projects<br/>1 Youtube Series<br/>3 Various RPG Projects<br/><br/><b>French Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Online Platform<br/><br/>Article: <a href="https://teylen.blog/2019/06/02/crowdfunding-collection-108/" rel="nofollow">https://teylen.blog/2019/06/02/crowdfunding-collection-108/</a> </div>

                            I present to you the new <a href="https://teylen.blog/2019/06/09/crowdfunding-collection-109/" rel="nofollow">Crowdfunding Collection no. 109, including every tabletop project started between 06/02 and 06/09.</a><br/><br/>This week I’d really like to highlight Adventures in <b>Austerion</b>. The game offers stunning artworks and is a fascinating mix of a boardgame and a tabletop rpg without loosing the latter identity. It’s available in English and French and I backed it the moment I found the project, I do highly recommend checking it out. Another interesting game is <b>Sleepaway</b>. The game focuses on campsite horror story and does so by using the Belonging Outside Belonging System from Avery Alder, thus I am tempted. If you are looking for a traditional approach, check out <b>Dungeons &amp; Delvers</b>. It offers exploring dungeons, killing monsters and looting all with a system inbetween D&amp;D 3E and 5E. If you like D&amp;D5E you’ll find that both <b>Amazing Adventures</b> and <b>Rocket Age RPG</b> use the system. Amazing Adventures aims to offer a setting neutral approach, enabling you to play horror, SF, modern, pulp and games set in other genres. In contrast Rocket Age does focus on the titular genre. <b>Battlestations DIRTSIDE</b> isn’t a D&amp;D 5E yet am wonder how much of an RPG is it at all, as game set in a SciFi setting boarders the line of board- and tabletop roleplaying game. <b>Native American Role-Playing Game</b> is a more ttrpg and has a very interesting pitch, yet the presentation of the project took my enthusiasm down and I haven’t got trust that it will deliver. <b>Stormforged</b> on the other hand looks way better and appears to deliver a solid fantasy game.<br/>There are more cool projects like <b>Necronomiconis</b> by Artisano Del Reyes (on Kickstarter and Verkam) which aims to produce a stunningly beautiful Cthulhu accessoire book. Then there’s the French urban fantasy game <b>Cities and Crimes</b>, which I would have backed in a blink of an eye, were they to deliver to Germany. Thus I have to hope that enough French, Belgian and Swiss gamers back it so it comes to be.<br/>There are many, many more cool crowdfundings, see for yourself:<br/><br/><b>English Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>5 Role-Playing Games<br/>2 D&amp;D 5E based Role-Playing Games<br/>1 Hybrid Role-Playing Game<br/>1 Setting<br/>3 Sourcebooks<br/>2 Adventures<br/>5 Dice Projects<br/>1 Dice Accessoire<br/>2 Deluxe Accessoires<br/>1 Soundscape<br/>2 Notebooks<br/>4 Various RPG Projects<br/>1 Other Game<br/><br/><b>Spanish Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Deluxe Accessoire<br/><br/><b>French Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Role-Playing Game<br/><br/><b>Italian Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Role-Playing Game<br/><br/>Artikel: &lt;&lt;a href="<a href="https://teylen.blog/2019/06/09/crowdfunding-collection-109/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://teylen.blog/2019/06/09/crowdfunding-collection-109/</a>"&gt;<a href="https://teylen.blog/2019/06/09/crowdfunding-collection-109/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://teylen.blog/2019/06/09/crowdfunding-collection-109/</a> </div>

                            I present to you the <b><a href="https://teylen.blog/2019/06/24/crowdfunding-collection-110/" rel="nofollow">new Crowdfunding Collection no.110, including every tabletop project started between 06/10 and 06/23.</a></b><br/><br/>My attendance to NordCon (a German role-playing game convention), delayed the collection for a week, thus it comes with none fewer than a total of 70 projects,… let’s get to them.<br/><br/>I’d like to briefly highlight the gamebook <b>Kurai Jikan Eidolon</b> (in German) which still requires some funding. I do know the author, followed his previous crowdfunding campaigns on a different platform and do recommend the project based on his skills as well as his ability to fulfill his projects.<br/><br/>Back to the English project, I did back <b>Wicked City</b>. The game uses a system based on Blades in the Dark and spices it up by allowing the players to essentially act as Dungeon Keeper. I liked both and thus couldn’t resist. Neither could I resist <b>The Roleplayer’s Guide To Heists</b>, which is a system-agnostic sourcebooks. I tend to regularly have groups trying to do a heist of one kind or another, and think the guide will be mighty useful.<br/>Next to those two I almost backed a lot of more narrative games – which I grouped under „Story Game Role-Playing Games“. Like <b>Hearts of Magic: Threads Entangled</b>, a game that places the players in the tumultous conflicts between fey-nobles, arcane bureaucrats and anarchist witches – a setup that does sound fun. On a way more serious note I might back into <b>Red Carnations on a Black Grave</b>, which sees the players assume the role of French resistance member during World War II. The game takes a cue from Montesgur 1244 and offers historic characters to explore the conflicts. Then there’s the way more „fantastic“ <b>Bleak Spirit</b>, a game that aims to be a kind of (Dark) Souls-like. Yet, not by providing the players with very difficult fights, and more by providing a setting which melancholy and darkness is inspired by the one of the Souls series. Then there is <b>What We Were</b>, which shares the investigation of the characters personality with Bleak Spirits, while not being as bleak. Well, and there’s <b>Troll’s Teeth</b>, I have no idea how it works, but I am impressed by the use of wedges for the game mechanic.<br/>With the, kind of avalanch, of fantasy rpgs, I found the Science Fiction approach of <b>The ADVANCED</b> kind of fresh. Among the fantasy games I like the design and graphics of <b>Zafir: Tactical Roleplaying Game</b>, <b>Children of the Beast</b> and <b>The King of Dungeons</b> – they do look very neat. Yet I do would recommend that you take a glance at <b>Emberlord</b>, <b>Realm of the Livingstones</b>, <b>Age of Hunters</b>, <b>Awoken</b> and <b>The Awakening RPG</b> as well, if you like fantasy.<br/>There is an English gamebook by the name of <b>Escape from Darkmoor</b> and plenty more, interesting, cool projects worth checking out, just take a look:<br/><br/><b>German Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Gamebook<br/>1 Sourcebook<br/>1 Patreon<br/><br/><b>English Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>9 Fantasy Role-Playing Games<br/>1 Science Fiction Role-Playing Games<br/>5 Story Game Role-Playing Games<br/>1 Gamebook<br/>2 Settings<br/>2 D&amp;D 5E Settings<br/>5 Sourcebooks<br/>3 D&amp;D 5E Sourcebooks<br/>2 Adventures<br/>5 Dice &amp; Coin Projects<br/>4 Dice Accessoires<br/>3 Playing Cards<br/>1 Notebook<br/>3 Enamel Pins<br/>3 Maps &amp; Miniatures<br/>2 Soundscapes &amp; Podcasts<br/>2 Larps<br/>6 Various RPG Projects<br/><br/><b>Spanish Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>2 Role-Playing Games<br/>1 Sourcebook<br/>1 Campaign<br/><br/><b>French Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Role-Playing Game<br/>1 Setting<br/>1 Sourcebook<br/><br/><b>Italian Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Campaign<br/><br/>Article: <a href="https://teylen.blog/2019/06/24/crowdfunding-collection-110/" rel="nofollow">https://teylen.blog/2019/06/24/crowdfunding-collection-110/</a> </div>
