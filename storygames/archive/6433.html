I was thinking back to my own games, where we often had things like:<br/><br/>"The theme song would totally be composed by Michael Bolton" ("yeeeechhhhhh!")<br/>"My guy Roger Abrams looks like Clive Owen in a Chicago PD uniform".<br/>(an NPC comes into a scene, and a player interjects) "Oh, she's totally portrayed by that chick who plays the Vulcan in Star Trek Enterprise, can't you just picture it?" (Blalock)<br/><br/>Fantasy Football is awesome because you get to assemble your team of players you love, and using their stats you get to play through a season with them.<br/><br/>PTA is kind of like that, for some folks anyway (who have interactions like the above), as it lets you assemble your team of actors/actresses you love, and using their mannerisms you get to play through a season with them.<br/><br/>Just a quick, random thought.<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142488">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142488/#Comment_142488" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-05T14:25:48+00:00" title="May  5, 2008  2:25PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes.

So, if I want a character who's sauve, but a bit rough around the edges, I have him played by Clive Owen (or some other equally smooth actor - I try to use someone new every time).  That way when I get stuck for something to say or do, I just ask myself "What would Clive Owen do?"<br/><br/>Which does not explain why I used Kevin Spacey for my last Mechwarrior character, but that is the topic for another thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_142695">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson" title="Matt Wilson"><img alt="Matt Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dog-eared-designs.com/img/goaticon2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson">Matt Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142695/#Comment_142695" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-06T12:49:27+00:00" title="May  6, 2008 12:49PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ha ha, awesome.

A 'no-nonsense, tough-as-nails government agent' described as being played by Michael Biehn is different from the same character described as being played by Hugo Weaving (specifically from the Matrix).<br/><br/>For the "Victorian Superheroes" campaign of <i>Mutants &amp; Masterminds</i> I ran a couple of years ago, I used Photoshop extensively, to take this concept to it's limit .  I created character portraits for all the recurring NPCs, cobbled together from pictures nabbed off the Internet.  I cast famous and not-so-famous people in the various roles, and did my ham-handed best to recreate their delivery when I spoke in-character; ally-hero 'The Duelist' was played by Kiefer Sutherland, villainous and psychotic re-animator 'Robin Graves' was played by Crispin Glover.  Evil mentalist 'Doctor Morocco' was played by Peter Lorre (accent and all, God help me).  Time-traveling-superheroes-from-the-future 'Goldsmith' and 'Spitfire' were played by David Krumholz and Shania Twain.  I cast Hugo Weaving as 'Agent Bayard of Her Majesty's Secret Service' -- he was in an antagonistic relationship with the PCs, and I was counting on the player's knee-jerk reactions to 'Agent Smith's' face and measured tones to reinforce that.  If Bayard had been intended to be less antagonistic, I might have cast George Lazenby...  <br/><br/>For historical NPCs like Queen Victoria and Sitting Bull (who both appeared), I used actual photos of the person -- with the exception of 'Inspector Abberline of Scotland Yard', who was played by Johnny Depp, reprising his role as Abberline in <i>'From Hell'</i>.  (Because Depp is so much more charismatic than the real Inspector Abberline).  <br/><br/>It was very useful to have artwork available instead of relying just on verbal descriptions.  It definitely added nuances to the game.  Having 'Warden Ravenscroft of the Tower of London' played by Christopher Walken guaranteed that the PCs never completely trusted him, despite the fact that he never once betrayed a confidence or acted against their interests.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br/><br/>--<br/>DainXB                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_142935">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142935/#Comment_142935" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-07T13:01:52+00:00" title="May  7, 2008  1:01PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That feels right.
