So, let's assume that is the case here.<br/><br/>Spending XP this way does two things:<br/><br/>1. You get 1 PP in exchange for each 1 XP spent;<br/>2. You increase your session-starting PP by 1 PP for each 1 XP spent, to a maximum of +4 PP increase; this "upgrade" disappears at the beginning of the next Act.<br/><br/>So, you can buy as many PP as you want, but only the first 4 XP spent increase your session-starting PP pool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364235">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364235/#Comment_364235" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-01T11:21:02+00:00" title="March  1, 2012 11:21AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Say I buy 4PP with 4XP.<br/><br/>Would that actually mean I've bought 8PP with 4PP?<br/><br/>I get 4PP now AND 4 more at the start of the next Act?<br/><br/>Or does this mean that I get to keep 4 more at the start of the next Act, assuming I have any left to keep?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364236">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364236/#Comment_364236" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-01T11:23:50+00:00" title="March  1, 2012 11:23AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite><br/>Does that then also mean you can't use both a push and a stunt at the same time?<br/><br/>Followup question, why would you choose to give someone a Complication instead of Stress?<br/><br/>I can see why you would want to do both if you could use both at the same time, but now that you can't, I'm not sure.

Push is sort of like "well, I need a bonus, but can't really justify it in any way fictionally, so here's just a bit of hand-waving" whereas Stunt is "I use this fictional element related to the situation or my character to justify getting a bonus." Hence Push dice being a D6 and Stunt dice being a D8.<br/><br/>An as for Complications and Stress, Stress affects one person, whereas Complications are a broader effect, and thus could be weaved into your action against anyone potentially affected by it. Sure, if you're introducing a narrow Complication that really only affects one target, sure, Stress would make more sense. Otherwise, bringing forth a horde of paparazzi to interefere with a bunch of villains/heroes, or setting a room on fire to block two opposing sides from clashing (assuming of course they aren't immune to fire) can sometimes be more effective, if not more dramatic.<br/><br/>At least, that's the way I've been reading into it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364237/#Comment_364237" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-01T11:24:00+00:00" title="March  1, 2012 11:24AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>If I spend a Plot Point to make an Asset last for the entire scene (rather than the next roll), does that mean:<br/>- We can roll it multiple times in a scene?<br/>- Can we roll it multiple times in the same Action Order?</blockquote>\nI'm not sure what you mean about rolling the Asset multiple times in the Action Order.<br/><br/>Spending the PP on the Asset just means that it doesn't go away when used.

Push is sort of like "well, I need a bonus, but can't really justify it in any way fictionally, so here's just a bit of hand-waving" whereas Stunt is "I use this fictional element related to the situation or my character to justify getting a bonus." Hence Push dice being a D6 and Stunt dice being a D8.</blockquote>\nI think some of the confusion I've seen is that the name "Push dice" sounds awesome! <br/><br/>It sounds like I'm pushing myself beyond my limits or breaking ties or doing something amazing. But it's effectively a power stunt except I don't have to describe what it is or be creative, so I get a D6 instead of a D8. All the additional names for traits have been confusing new players, fortunately the rules themselves work really well. Having to learn Affiliation, Distinction, Power, Specialty, Stunt, Stress, Trauma, Resource, Asset, Complication, Push... when they are all effectively traits, just used in slightly different ways is jarring. I assumed that the reason these were all named different things was to keep things simple and balanced when building Dice Pools. I can add any relevant Trait as long as I don't add Traits with the same name. So I can't add 2 Specialties unless I spend a Plot Point. But things get confusing when I have to choose between either a Push or a Stunt, a Complication or a Stress. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: stupidgremlin</cite>An as for Complications and Stress, Stress affects one person, whereas Complications are a broader effect, and thus could be weaved into your action against anyone potentially affected by it. Sure, if you're introducing a narrow Complication that really only affects one target, sure, Stress would make more sense. Otherwise, bringing forth a horde of paparazzi to interefere with a bunch of villains/heroes, or setting a room on fire to block two opposing sides from clashing (assuming of course they aren't immune to fire) can sometimes be more effective, if not more dramatic.</blockquote>\nThat sounds pretty cool! But so far it reads as if Complications aren't broader effects. That's probably what you would use an Asset for. <br/><br/>Complication:\n<blockquote>A complication is like stress because it\u2019s<br/>often inflicted on you as a result of an action,<br/>but it\u2019s also like an asset in reverse\u2014you use<br/>an effect die to create a disadvantage for<br/>your opponent rather than an advantage for<br/>your hero. When a hero suffers a complication,<br/>his actions are harder to perform, much<br/>like stress. Unlike stress, complications don\u2019t<br/>lead to trauma and usually go away once the<br/>situation is resolved. Heroes may also inflict<br/>complications on their opponents, useful<br/>when you just want to impair or hinder them.<br/>You can render someone helpless with a<br/>complication that\u2019s stepped up beyond d12,<br/>which has much the same effect as being<br/>stressed out.<br/><br/>To create a complication, use an effect die<br/>like you do to create an asset. Give it a name<br/>and a rating equal to the size of the effect die<br/>used to create it (minimum d6). You may add<br/>it to your dice pools against the target just<br/>as you would add stress.<br/><br/>I\u2019m playing Colossus and I\u2019d rather wrap<br/>an iron bar around the Hellfire Guards<br/>than smash them. I roll my dice, including<br/>my Godlike Strength d12, and the<br/>Watcher rolls dice for the Guard. I get<br/>the higher total, so I can now use my<br/>d8 effect die to create a complication,<br/>rather than stress. I call it Bound in Iron<br/>d8 and now on future rolls against the<br/>Guard I can add the d8 to my pool.<br/>Anyone can use a complication that\u2019s<br/>been inflicted on a target, not just you. That\u2019s<br/>because the complication, like stress, is essentially<br/>a trait on the opponent\u2019s datafile<br/>rather than one on yours.<br/><br/>You can try to exploit a complication<br/>that\u2019s been inflicted on you, just like you can<br/>exploit stress that\u2019s been inflicted on you,<br/>but you need a good narrative reason to do<br/>it, and it steps up by one after you\u2019ve used it,<br/>just like stress does when you use it this way.</blockquote>\nAsset:\n<blockquote>I\u2019m playing Kitty Pryde and I\u2019m trying to<br/>decrypt a firewall so that the rest of the<br/>X-Men can break into the Hellfire Club\u2019s<br/>mansion. Putting together my dice pool<br/>from Distinctions, Specialties, and so on,<br/>I have a total pool of d10 + 2d6 + d4. I<br/>roll and get a total of 11 (7 on the d10, 4<br/>on a d6) and my effect die is a d6. Turns<br/>out the Watcher only got an 8 total when<br/>rolling the doom pool, so Kitty breaks<br/>through the encryption. I want to use<br/>the effect die to create an asset, so I<br/>declare Compromised Security d6 and<br/>can either give that to one of the other<br/>players or save it for another roll against<br/>the Hellfire Club\u2019s computer system.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364260">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364260/#Comment_364260" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-01T11:59:50+00:00" title="March  1, 2012 11:59AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christian Griffen</cite>Also, I as Spider-Man am not going to punch Wolverine (physical stress, which he can shrug off easily with his powers), I'm going to web him up (complications).</blockquote>\nGreat point!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364261">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks" title="CamBanks"><img alt="CamBanks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks">CamBanks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364261/#Comment_364261" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-01T12:01:36+00:00" title="March  1, 2012 12:01PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, the names for different traits not only helps determine what you can use in a dice pool, but what specific SFX or other game mechanics can apply to or affect.

What happens if you try to run the Rhino over with a freight train?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe deal with the Rhino is that he's pretty dang tough, but not totally invulnerable.  The GM isn't sure exactly what would happen, so he calls for a roll.  Several things here:<br/>\n<br/>\n1.  It seems like nothing exists "in the fiction" until someone creates it via an effect die to turn it into an asset or complication.  (I guess the GM can create a "scene distinction," but that's still spending a mechanical element.)  So you've got to create it via mechanics, probably by rolling dice.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  "In fiction," a freight train hitting a dude has got to be pretty dang bad-ass.  But if you're rolling to create this thing, you might have a really crappy effect die.<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  After you create the train as an asset of [SIZE], you've still gotta make your attack roll.  Since you probably don't have a power set or skill related to vehicular homicide, you're rolling your affiliation + train asset + (maybe) a distinction.  For most heroes, this is probably a worse dice pool than just punching somebody in the face.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's totally possible I've missed something in the rulebook about this and I'm being an idiot.  But this isn't a "James is a crazy person" special case, because:<br/>\n<br/>\n* It's a little bit like the super-slick mechanics in 4e.  The fluff on those power descriptions is kind of bullshit.  What you've got is mechanical causes leading to mechanical effects, briefly passing through the fiction on the way.  Improvisation and riffing on the fictional environment are certainly possible in 4e (uh, well, depending on the thirty-times errata'd skill mechanics, maybe not so much) but in any case is seldom the expected or optimal approach.<br/>\n<br/>\n* If you're familiar with Vincent Baker's clouds (fiction) and dice (mechanics) diagrams, it looks like a lot of the action in <i>Marvel Heroic Roleplaying</i> is dice-affecting-dice stuff.  If something's impossible, or too easy, you don't need to roll the dice, but there may be neat ideas which fictionally ought to have certain properties but the dice-economy makes it difficult.  I'm concerned that stuff which originates in the fiction doesn't have much bite.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364366">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364366/#Comment_364366" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-01T16:35:10+00:00" title="March  1, 2012  4:35PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 1, 2012 4:35PM by stupidgremlin.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm...normally, if it were a hero vs. a freight train, it'd be the hero's dice vs. a Doom Pool roll.<br><br>But you're talking about a hero driving the freight train to run into the Rhino, right?

I guess the main thing to remember is that a train in most circumstances is not a very effective weapon. If its hits, it will hurt, but most people will be able to leap out of the way or whatever reducing its effect significantly.<br><br>I think the best way to model it would be to create it as an Asset and then wait until Rhino rolls an Opportunity or three, stepping up the train beyond d12 with PP and hoping to use it as your Effect dice for an instant take down. I think this also models the difficulty of timing the freight train until Rhino slips up when he can take the full brunt of it.<br><br>Another possibility, if you want to treat it as a one off thing would be a Stunt.

It plays pretty fast and once we were done we wanted to go back to the book and read up but it isn't initially that difficult or complicated, just very fiddily with lots of bits to push around in fun ways.  But getting good at pushing those fiddily bits around would take a little re-reading is all.  <br/><br/>When I was 13, I was reading the Who's Who in the DC Universe and the Handbook of the Marvel Universe, statting obscure comic book characters out in the Champions system.

Well, not everything about them does, just their timing. Help? Please?<br/><br/>For the life of me I cannot find any hard and fast statement in the book on how long Assets and Complications last. I was able to find a line in the paragraph on extending Complications and Assets that says they last "a single roll or conflict", or until the end of the next Action Scene if a player spends a PP to keep it around. The impression I was left with of Assets is that they're meant to last only for one roll. Are Complications meant to be the same way as well? If so, do they stick around until someone decides to roll that die, or do they go away after the end of the round?  Or maybe they hang out until the end of the current Action Scene? If so, once they're rolled, do Assets/Complications just go away? Or do they continue to hang out for the rest of the scene?<br/><br/>Let me illustrate this with some experience that I had from Dreamation. The players in one group decided they wanted to beat up on Count Nefaria, a villain in the Breakout mini-event. Nefaria's flying all over the place, doing all sorts of sweet stuff with his kinetic manipulation abilities. Spidey and Daredevil got pretty fed up with that, so they threw two complications on him in a row; Spidey "Grounded d8" him, and DD "Bound d10" him. Now, the way I had read the rules, it seemed to me that the Complications lasted until the end of the scene unless a player spent the Complication die in one of his pools. I described this to the players, so they just left him there with those Complications on him and Nefaria writhed around on the ground for the rest of the Scene. <br/><br/>Did I do this correctly? Or would the Complications worn off earlier, leaving Nefaria to wreak havoc all over our heroes? Would the players have been able to use the Complications they had heaped on Nefaria to beat him up some more without the Complication disappearing?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Skywalker" title="Skywalker"><img alt="Skywalker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Skywalker">Skywalker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364691/#Comment_364691" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-02T14:33:48+00:00" title="March  2, 2012  2:33PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 2, 2012 2:37PM by Skywalker.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            They last as long as they as they are narratively appropriate. It can be short as a single roll or as long as a scene. <br/><br/>You can extend an Asset or Complication by spending a PP. They extend until the end of the next Action Scene, though they are still bound by the narrative so make sure the extension makes sense.<br/><br/>You can look to recover Complication with recovery actions in Transition Scenes.<br/><br/>You can also target Assets and Complications with actions to eliminate or reduce them.<br/><br/>In the case of Neferia, the players would need to explain some way that what the PCs did would keep Neferia from simply taking off again, or I would adjudicate that it would only last a single roll. For example, perhaps he was stuck with webs to the ground. In this case, it would last as long as either Neferia broke the web, by targeting the Complication, or some other narrative reason for the web breaking came up (such as the place being on fire).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Marvel Heroic RPG - Rules Questions... - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15994/marvel-heroic-rpg-rules-questions/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Marvel Heroic RPG - Rules Questions... - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15994/marvel-heroic-rpg-rules-questions/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="I can't remember, but can villains take action against the doom pool?

They simply take an action (they can't do anything else that round other than make reaction rolls) and hand one of their traits to another villain.<br/><br/>Using this logic, if the Watcher announces, "Count Nefaria is going to attack Nick Fury" and then turns to the players, "what do you do?" If the players do nothing or choose to take care of some other threat, then I would simply rule that Count Nefaria automatically succeeds, no roll needed, and apply any of his relevant traits as stress to Nick Fury. <br/><br/>What's interesting about that, because the Watcher didn't roll, they could not take out Fury in 1 action, the worse they could do is apply d12 stress. The next action would bump that d12 to Stressed Out. So in effect it would act as a warning to the players. "Next action, Fury is done, Nefaria targets Fury again, anyone?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364967">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364967/#Comment_364967" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-03T20:54:51+00:00" title="March  3, 2012  8:54PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b><u>Questions from Running Twice In One Day</u></b><br/>\n<br/>\n1a.  How does the game handle "passive perception"?  The GM just declares what the player might see?  Like, a hero walks into a room and an invisible villain is there.  The villain doesn't want to fight--he just wants to escape.  The player [distinct from the hero character] may not know the villain is there, so might not call for a roll.  Do we then wait for the villain to take an action [goal: escape without being detected] and the hero then opposes with whatever may apply?<br/>\n<br/>\n1b.  What if, instead of a villain [i.e., an NPC with agency] it's a clue that the player may not even know to look for in the first place?  Can the doom pool initiate action on its own [goal: this tiny clue goes unnoticed]?<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  How does the game handle attacking someone at range?  I.e., Spider-Man hurling a chunk of concrete at the Vulture who's trying to fly away over the East River?  Is distance a kind of <i>ad hoc</i> asset or complication?<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  How does the game handle mechanically-independent traits that are fictionally interlinked?  In question <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>, we had Spider-Man hurling a big rock at the Vulture.  The Vulture had an Asset: Vulture Flying Away as well as a power trait, Vulture's Wings.  The player described using his rock to smash the Vulture's wings (i.e., totally demolishing that power trait--ain't no wings left), but what does that do to the Vulture Flying Away asset?  Is the Vulture still flying away even without wings?  Does the Vulture Flying Away get removed, bumped down, changed to Vulture Swimming Away or what?  Should the Vulture take physical stress from being hit with a catapult stone?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364970">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364970/#Comment_364970" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-03T21:14:33+00:00" title="March  3, 2012  9:14PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James_Nostack</cite>a hero walks into a room and an invisible villain is there.

The only tension in the scene comes from everyone knowing Invisiboy is sneaking away.  I would suggest that this is a good point in time to use the Automatic Success rule - spend a die out of the doom pool higher than the trait you're trying to negate (someone's Investigation specialty or whatnot).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James_Nostack</cite>What if, instead of a villain [i.e., an NPC with agency] it's a clue that the player may not even know to look for in the first place?

So this is pretty hard to answer. It doesn't really make a lot of sense in the context of a game where things happening is the primary way the game's organized.<br>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James_Nostack</cite>How does the game handle attacking someone at range?

He can then roll that in opposition to Spider-Man.<br><br>It's not really ad hoc, that's how Complications work?<br>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James_Nostack</cite>In question <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>, we had Spider-Man hurling a big rock at the Vulture.

So I like your idea of changing "Flying Away" to "Swimming Away", because the purpose of the Complication was to show how hard it is to take down the Vulture when you can't punch him.<br><br>Although I would say it is more of a Complication for Spider-Man than an Asset for the Vulture.

Rather than having Electro fly some dude away from the raft in Break-Out, I used the Vulture.  So he's not just escaping from Spider-Man, he's escaping from everybody, so I gotta buy it as an asset because there are multiple heroes involved, and therefore an complication tagged to a single hero won't do it.  But if we have that as an asset (or a complication or whatever), what happens when there are multiple people around, fictionally at different distances?  The Vulture might be "getting away d12" with respect to the Thing, but only "getting away d6" with respect Iron Man.  This would make sense as a complication tagged to each hero, but would require many, many effect dice to set up.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond and much more importantly: if we eliminate or reduce an asset or complication "for free" when it makes fictional sense to do so, why can't we <i>create</i> an asset/complication/stress when it makes fictional sense?  Why is saying, "Trashing the Vulture's wings with a rock makes his escaping go away, of course.

Rather than having Electro fly some dude away from the raft in Break-Out, I used the Vulture.  So he's not just escaping from Spider-Man, he's escaping from everybody, so I gotta buy it as an asset because there are multiple heroes involved, and therefore an complication tagged to a single hero won't do it.  But if we have that as an asset (or a complication or whatever), what happens when there are multiple people around, fictionally at different distances?  The Vulture might be "getting away d12" with respect to the Thing, but only "getting away d6" with respect Iron Man.  This would make sense as a complication tagged to each hero, but would require many, many effect dice to set up.<br/><br/>Second and much more importantly: if we eliminate or reduce an asset or complication "for free" when it makes fictional sense to do so, why can't we<em>create</em>an asset/complication/stress when it makes fictional sense?  Why is saying, "Trashing the Vulture's wings with a rock makes his escaping go away, of course.  But don't you dare say it causes physical stress."</blockquote>\nJDCorley's answer makes sense. <br/><br/>In regard to having a different level of Complication by individual character, thats a level of detail the game doesn't really go into. RPGs are full of such abstractions, so it's just a question of getting used to it. <br/><br/>However, the system handles this kind of thing in a way. For example, if Vulture has the "Getting Away d12" Complication, and a PC goes after him, it's easier for that PC to create their own Asset of "Closing In on Vulture" at lowered dice than a d12, than removing the Complication. <br/><br/>Alternatively, if Vulture only got distance from one PC, as GM, suggest that the Complication be "Getting Away from Captain America d12" instead of something more general.<br/><br/>In terms of creating and ending Assets and Complication when it makes fictional sense, this is not really as assymetrical as you make it out to be. A GM can add Assets and Complications when it makes fictional sense, especially at the start of a scene, so as to allow players more control over the scene through their dice rolls. Likewise, removing an Asset and Complication normally requires a dice roll (see targeting Traits). The main point is that though there is a resource economy drive by dice rolls, it should never override the narrative. When the two conflict, the narrative wins.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_365006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365006/#Comment_365006" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-04T04:23:58+00:00" title="March  4, 2012  4:23AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            More questions: <br/><br/>1.

Though I cannot locate an actual comic where this happens, I thought I'd make my own.<br/><img alt="image" src="http://mmms.wikidot.com/local--resized-images/general-image-hosting/SpideyScan0001.jpg/medium.jpg"/><br/><br/>I think you can click on that to make it (much too) big.  Spider-Man is frustrated with the Vulture, so he throws a 500-pound air-conditioning unit at him, breaking Vulture's wings, so the Vulture can no longer fly.  At the end, we see that the Vulture has sustained some injuries from the impact and the fall.  While I'm no artist, I think this is an extremely natural and plausible way to imagine these events.  (I'm not saying everyone's got to agree with me, just that I don't think I'm crazy for imagining things this way.)<br/><br/>So if this was you and me, as little kids, running around the backyard pretending to be super-heroes, it would sound something like this:<br/>JASON-VULTURE: "You can't catch me, you're out of webs!"<br/>ME-SPIDEY: "Fine!  I throw a heavy thing at you, ka-pow!"<br/>JASON-VULTURE: "Oh no, my wings, I can't fly!"<br/>ME-SPIDEY: "Also, I've ruptured your spleen."<br/>JASON: "No you didn't!"<br/>ME-SPIDEY: "Yes I did!"<br/><br/>One way to understand role-playing games is that they resolve the "no you didn't / yes I did" impasse.  Stop arguing, go to the dice.  <br/>JASON-WATCHER: "Congratulations, you broke the Vulture's Enhanced Flight d8."<br/>ME-SPIDEY: "And so what does that do to his asset/complication/stunt of getting away?"<br/>JASON-WATCHER: "Well, that goes away too."<br/>ME-SPIDEY: "Really?  I only had one effect die."<br/>JASON-WATCHER: "Well sure, but it doesn't make any sense for the Vulture to continue to fly away once his wings are busted!"<br/>ME-SPIDEY: "Okay.  Cool.  Does the Vulture take any physical stress?"<br/>JASON-WATCHER: "No.  You only had one effect die."<br/>ME-SPIDEY: "But surely hitting a dude with a massive fuckin' object is gonna bang him up just as plausibly as thwart his escape."<br/>JASON-WATCHER: "No, that's totally not the same thing because the dice economy requires it to be a different thing."<br/>ME-SPIDEY: "This is one of those ridiculous-if-you-think-about-it things like Class &amp; Hit Points in D&amp;D, isn't it?"<br/>JASON-WATCHER: "Not at all!  Just imagine the comics, they wouldn't illustrate the Vulture getting his wings broken AND getting hurt."  <br/>ME-SPIDEY: "No, I didn't just imagine a comic, I made you one.  You could totally illustrate that."<br/>JASON: "No you couldn't."<br/>ME: "Yes you could!  I just did!"<br/>JASON: "No you couldn't!  The mechanics say you must have drawn something different!"<br/><br/>We're back to arguing about what the fiction ought to look like based on intuition.  You're going to win the argument because that's how the mechanics work, but those mechanics require a particular fictional approach which is about as sensible as fire-and-forget spellcasting: i.e., not especially sensible but can live with it.<br/><br/>I think you've either got to embrace the mechanics fully and unapologetically without referencing what "ought" to happen in the fiction, or else allow the players / GM to slap on an extra effect die here or there when it makes sense to do so.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_365019">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365019/#Comment_365019" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-04T08:24:18+00:00" title="March  4, 2012  8:24AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James_Nostack</cite>Well, for one thing because villains cannot stunt.

That's a power/power set.<br><br>Yes, with his roll, he should create an Escaping! Asset. But the way that his flight is expressed is not in the Asset, it's in the pool he rolls to get the Asset.  So when his wings get crunched, his power is shut down (it has the Gear Limit, so this can happen), but the Asset remains until taken out by other effect dice. He would still be Escaping! some other way. If we accidentally wrote something too specific on the Asset like "Flying Away", we should fix that if what we really mean is "he's a long way away".<br><br>If someone - anyone - closes with him, he no longer has that advantage in achieving his goal (escape!), so it goes away completely, no matter who else is where.  It don't matter if it's Thor or Squirrel Girl.

Do it however makes sense: the addition or subtraction of one die from the die pool is really not that significant. There's normally going to be a lot of dice in the die pool.  This is why a Power Set with 10 powers in it is balanced with a Power Set with 2 in it - because you only get one die from the pool for free and have to pay for everything else. Similarly, even if you're rolling a shit-ton of dice, you still only get to keep 2 + 1 effect without spending Plot Points. It's the Plot Point/Doom Pool economy that's really driving the balance here, not the die pool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_365114">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365114/#Comment_365114" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-04T15:40:35+00:00" title="March  4, 2012  3:40PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>How can I create a "<b>spreading wild fire</b>" or "<b>escaping helicopter</b>" trait that steps up at the end of every round?</blockquote>\nScene Distinction.

Revealing that is "something happens".  <br/><br/>But you shouldn't roll to notice a clue (for example) if the result of failure is "welp, you're there".

It don't matter if it's Thor or Squirrel Girl. That's how I would do it.</blockquote>\nThat's exactly the conclusion I came to as well.  In fact you can even see it in the little comic I drew:\n<ol>\n<li>the Vulture creates <b>asset: far away d8</b>.  Spider-Man tries to use his webs but the Watcher activates the <b>Limit: Out of Juice</b>.</li>\n<li>Spider-Man takes a round to somehow create <b>asset: 500-pound ventilation unit d8</b> while the off-panel Vulture somehow bumps his own asset to <b>d10</b></li>\n<li>Spider-Man hurls the ventilation unit and removes the Vulture's <b>Feathery Flight d8</b> power trait.  The <b>far away</b> asset remains.</li>\n<li>Spider-Man somehow takes action against the <b>far away</b> asset, eliminating it.  (Oops!  The stupid artist forgot Spidey was out of webbing!)</li>\n<li>The action resumes with Spider-Man in close proximity to the Vulture...</li>\n</ol>\nMy hang-up was that I wasn't allowing the fiction to police the mechanical possibilities.  Purely looking at mechanics, Spider-Man ends up with a <b>d10</b> effect die which he could use either to remove the <b>far away</b> asset, inflict stress, inflict a <b>complication d10</b>, or remove one of the Vulture's power traits.  But all of this starts with Spider-Man's stated intention: "I'm throwing a heavy object at this guy."  Hitting the Vulture with a heavy object doesn't bring him any closer to you, so you can't remove the asset.  Under the circumstances, it's difficult to imagine a complication <i>other</i> than physical stress, so complications are most likely ruled out.  Mental or emotional stress is theoretically possible, but not easy to justify.  Busting the Vulture's flight power trait, however, is both fictionally plausible, mechanically permitted, and tactically helpful.  The table has to provide a consensus on limiting effects to what's fictionally plausible.  (This principle is implied on page OM54, and maybe elsewhere.)<br/><br/>(Aside: I've heard hopefully apocryphal stories that in <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 4e</i> you can knock an ooze prone.  This is really weird, because an ooze can't stand up in the first place!  But the design philosophy of 4e apparently means that the mechanical cause, your White Phoenix Death-Trip, is going to have a mechanical effect, your enemy is knocked prone, regardless of whether that makes fictional sense.  That doesn't seem to be the case with <i>Marvel Heroic</i>, at least not entirely: the table's gotta act as a gatekeeper so that the fiction constrains the mechanics.)<br/><br/>PANEL 5 represents the inverse of this principle, and is why I drew the comic originally.  Instead of the fiction subtracting from the full range of mechanical effects, it might be <i>creating</i> a mechanical effect--in this case, <b>d6 physical stress</b> or something.  While this could have been from an extra effect die that Spider-Man purchased in PANEL 3, or Vulture's really unlucky landing in PANEL 4, it could just be thrown in there for the hell of it.  As you say, it probably wouldn't have a huge effect on the math, but the GM might want to spend a Doom Die just for the hell of it. <br/><br/>Thanks for your time, Jason.

(Using the "fiction polices the mechanics" principle I sorta-invented last post, Spider-Man wouldn't be able to use his super strength against a far-away enemy, so he needs an asset.)  This is mechanically significant, because he needs to create an asset.  But Spider-Man routinely lifts several tons, and let's stipulate the A/C unit is like 500 pounds.  In my little comic, Spidey spends Panel 2 putting together a die pool of Solo + Wisecrack + Strength.  But what's he rolling against?  Options that I see:<br/>\n<br/>\n* He doesn't need to roll at all.  Five hundred pounds is nothing for Spider-Man, it just happens.  Because there's no roll, there's no effect die, and hence no asset created.  It just makes the super strength attack in Panel 3 fictionally plausible and hence mechanically possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n* He doesn't need to roll because it's well within his abilities, and his <b>spider-strength d10</b> gets treated like a support die (variation on OM53), even though he's ultimately supporting himself.<br/>\n<br/>\n* He doesn't need to roll, and the GM says, "Eh, 500 pounds?  That's probably something someone with <b>Enhanced Strength d8</b> could lift with some strain, so take that as an <b>asset: 500-pound ventilation unit</b> at <b>d8</b>."  This permits the GM and players to size up stuff on the fly, without mucking around in the rolls.  This is useful!  Say Spider-Man is driving his Spider-Mobile for a peaceful Sunday drive without a care in the world, when a kid steps into traffic.  It would be handy to slap down: <b>complication: driving fast</b> without having to previously establish all this stuff with resources.  (If I were going to say the Vulture got banged up without mechanical cause, this is exactly how I'd do it.  "Eh, looks like about d6 physical stress, let's slap that on there.")<br/>\n<br/>\n* He rolls against the Doom Pool, because even if it's something he could normally do easily, we're gamers playing out a combat scene.  The weight, aerodynamics, and general suitability for bonking a flying vulture-man gets determined by Spider-Man's effect die.  To me, this skirts close to "don't roll if nothing happens on failure," but maybe it's a wasted opportunity and the Vulture continues to get away...?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's a related question about what the Vulture rolls against to land without taking injury when his wings are broken; presumably that's what he's trying to do in Panel 4.  This one may be in the rules somewhere and I missed it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_365123">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365123/#Comment_365123" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-04T16:45:55+00:00" title="March  4, 2012  4:45PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How does the timing of activating Opportunities work?<br><br>Each side of the equation can us Opporutnities to add dice to their pools, right?

And what's exciting is the "wild fire" could spread because of opportunities, which is more fun than just having it automatically step up at the end of a round.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_365138">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Skywalker" title="Skywalker"><img alt="Skywalker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Skywalker">Skywalker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365138/#Comment_365138" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-04T18:11:30+00:00" title="March  4, 2012  6:11PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The only thing I would add is that as players can only step up Assets on Watcher Opportunities, I would probably say that the Watcher could only spend Doom Dice to increase something envirnomental like wild fire when PCs rolled Opportunities.

I roll [Affiliation + Distinction + Power + Specialty], and I spend a Doom Die to add the Stunt, "High-Flying Retreat d8".<br/><br/>SPIDEY: I'm going to stop him! I roll [Affiliation + Distinction + Power + Specialty], and I spend a PP to add the Stunt (or use an existing Scene Distinction), "Hurled AC Unit d8".<br/><br/>They roll. Assuming that Spidey was rolling a Reaction and not an Action, if he succeeds, I think he simply prevents Vulture from escaping this round. He could spend a PP to use the Effect die to shutdown the Vulture's Wings trait, I believe.<br/><br/>If Spidey was rolling an Action, then he could declare his intent to be a shutdown of the Vulture's Wings trait, and Vulture is simply trying to defend himself by getting as far away as possible.<br/><br/>Anyway, if the Vulture wins in either case, then the fictional result is that he's flown off, and anyone attacking him either needs to have the ability to pursue him or attack at range. I don't know that specifics about range really matter. We're talking about superheroes here; they will find a way, be it a repulsor ray shot or a Fastball Special.<br/><br/>I dunno.

Yes, that's right. That's not really what "don't roll if failure means nothing happens" means in this context. Wolvy gets his turn to respond at some point and Magneto's actions have made it clear what he's after.

In terms of combat, the failure to do anything against an opponent isn't really nothing given the time pressure and tension of the scene. It provides an advantage to your opponent.</blockquote>\nI was about to post "makes sense" a few hours ago but forgot. Since then a few things happened which changed my opinion to "it depends".<br/><br/>Chris posted a great blog post, <a href="http://bankuei.wordpress.com/2012/03/05/a-closer-look-at-whiff-factor/" rel="nofollow">Closer Look at Whiff Factor</a> and I talked with 2 friends who played Marvel but rarely play RPGs otherwise (but read lots of comics). <br/><br/>They felt frustrated when they had to wait till it was their turn (in a 6 player game, that could be 15-20 minutes) only to whiff. It was boring for them. "This is one of the reasons we don't play most RPGs." Technically missing in combat isn't nothing happening because mechanically that means you are still in danger, the enemy gets to attack you again, and you might be taken out. But emotionally, for them, it feels empty. It feels like nothing happened. They admitted this would be less the case if there were only 2-3 players. As a gamer (of certain games), I'm conditioned to accept whiffing and waiting a long time for my turn. Or maybe they are conditioned to be less patient. Either way it feels off for them and theoretically they are more the audience for this game than I am. <br/><br/>The only 3 times the players didn't seem happy about the games we ran were: 1. being initially intimidated by the character sheet, 2. not liking what you spend XP on, and 3. whiffing after waiting quite a while to do something. <br/><br/>To be fair, the Marvel Action Order helps battle these negative feelings. If you whiff, you can choose who goes next and often that meant choosing the character who successfully defended against you so that they could attack you... opening the possibility you could counter attack and hold onto the spotlight longer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_365388">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365388/#Comment_365388" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-05T17:27:39+00:00" title="March  5, 2012  5:27PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 5, 2012 5:28PM by JDCorley.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes..the action order is a big help for people like this, if they recognize that that's what they want to be spending their resources/time on.  <br/><br/>Often times I get complaints from players that go like this (not a Marvel thing, just a RPG thing)<br/><br/>"I hate when my character goes last."<br/>"You know you can adjust your character in this way so you won't go last"<br/>"No, I don't want to do that, I just don't want to go last"<br/><br/>"Doctor, doctor, it hurts when I bang my head against the wall"<br/>"So don't bang your head against the wall"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_365390">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Skywalker" title="Skywalker"><img alt="Skywalker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Skywalker">Skywalker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365390/#Comment_365390" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-05T17:31:33+00:00" title="March  5, 2012  5:31PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another thing that will help this is don't run MHR with more than 5 players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_365429">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365429/#Comment_365429" name="Item_94" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-05T19:22:12+00:00" title="March  5, 2012  7:22PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When can I play the Silver Surfer?

I know that OM55 talks about the Watcher setting limits on whether a trait can be shut down or just stepped back, e.g., Godlike Strength d12 vs Godlike Durability d12 can theoretically only step down the other trait. But what about Godlike vs. Superhuman or lower?<br/><br/>I ask because shutdown seems like a really effective way to fight, especially if it can be done in one shot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_365521">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Skywalker" title="Skywalker"><img alt="Skywalker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Skywalker">Skywalker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365521/#Comment_365521" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-06T11:00:54+00:00" title="March  6, 2012 11:00AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think OM55 and common sense pretty much cover the subject.

Targetting Traits works too, but really these are the bread and butter aspects of the PC, so not using them is more remarkable than using them.<br/><br/>From a player's point of view, your decisions are not so much around how to form your core dice pool, which (thankfully as it helps speed up the game a lot) do form a pattern pretty quickly. It is on how to use the stuff around that core dice pool - SFX, PP, D4 Distinctions, Limits, Stress v Asset etc                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil" title="Neil"><img alt="Neil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil">Neil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366724/#Comment_366724" name="Item_107" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T04:02:01+00:00" title="March 12, 2012  4:02AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran the game on Saturday for the first time (I wrote <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.ukroleplayers.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=25&amp;t=12641&amp;p=138841&amp;sid=0e223cfb3167884d46aab2301e9bb29a#p138837" rel="nofollow">a report on UK Roleplayers</a>), and two questions came up.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the Action and Reaction totals are equal, what happens? We plumped for "Ties go to the PCs because they're awesome," but I'd like a definitive answer.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow long do Complications and Assets last? The game text says "Until the next roll or the end of the Conflict," but then doesn't define what a "Conflict" is. It seems a bit grating for the duration to be defined by GM fiat. For example, in the session on Saturday, Human Torch got clobbered by Nefaria and plunged into the river. I gave the Torch a d8 Complication of "Waterlogged" and the player promptly shut down his fire powers for a PP. In his next action, he got to shore. Should his Complication have gone away at that point, or should it continue to dog him for the rest of the scene (forcing him to spend an action to remove it before then)?<br/>\n<br/>\n(The general conclusion from the session was that the scenario is a string of fights and the game seems heavily weighted towards supporting fights and other action scenes. There seems to be much less, if any, real support from the mechanics for more inter-personal or investigation type scenes. You need a lot of dice to have a reliable pool, and you can burn a lot of PP and table credibility bringing them in when you're outside an action scene.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366770">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul%20Drussel" title="Paul Drussel"><img alt="Paul Drussel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul%20Drussel">Paul Drussel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366770/#Comment_366770" name="Item_108" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T08:22:25+00:00" title="March 12, 2012  8:22AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 12, 2012 8:23AM by Paul Drussel.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>If the Action and Reaction totals are equal, what happens?

If you want the asset to be more sticky, pay a PP and it's around until the end of the next scene. <br/><br/>Complications are around in a scene until removed or narratively irrelevant. They work a little like stress, but you can include both a stress die and a complication die in your roll for free if your opponent is hung up with them. <br/><br/>The narrative should be your big clue. Assets and complications may resolve before the end of the scene if and only if they were never intended to be appropriate past one dice roll. Otherwise yeah, they can linger. <br/><br/>By the way, I use situation as a word to describe what a scene is all about, the central conflict.

Fred posted a gist for it on the fate blog:<a href="http://www.faterpg.com/2012/fire/" rel="nofollow">It's on Fire</a>. Is applying a "fractal" to the game hacking it?<br/>Great idea!<br/><br/>You could make it a Specialty character (there are 5 types of Villains you can make - Major, Minor, Specialty, Mobs, Large-Scale Threat):<br/><br/>Specialty Villains have:<br/>- Affiliations of d4, d6, and d8<br/>- One Specialty at Rookie d6, Expert d8, or Master d10<br/>- May have one or more power traits, but not Power Sets<br/><br/>Fire:<br/>- Solo d8<br/>- Menace or Combat Master d10<br/>- Wild Fire d8/d10<br/><br/>Specialty character's level (Rookie, Expert or Master) determines how much stress of any type they can take before being stressed out. Rookies whose stress reaches d8, Experts whose stress reaches d10, and Masters whose stress reaches d12 are each stressed out. <br/><br/>There are also really amazing rules for Large-Scale Threats. They are built like full Villains but use the rules for Mobs. So Thanos or Apocalypse would have a normal datafile except they can have multiple dice in their Affiliation. Say 6d8 Solo. These act as Hit Points. You need to inflict D10 Stress to remove one of the Affiliation D8 dice. It makes it much less likely you will see a character of such importance get taken down in 1 punch. There's been ongoing jokes at various Marvel Launch parties about how easy Count Nefaria was to take out. Wait, you took him out in one hit to? <br/><br/>Count Nefaria is actually incredibly dangerous, if he gets to go first!

If you want to interrupt the action order and have one of your characters, such as a villain or an angry mob of thugs, act before the next hero, you need to spend a doom die. The default spend is a d6, although heroes with Enhanced,<br/><br/>Superhuman, or Godlike Reflexes (or Senses, in some cases) require you to spend a larger die (d8, d10, or d12, respectively). If your character has Reflexes or Senses of his own, it can offset this greater cost. For more on action order see page OM35.</blockquote>\nMy questions is: "How does a Villain's Sense or Reflex power offset the cost for interrupting the Action Order?"<br/><br/>I jumped to:\n<blockquote>page OM36 : If you\u2019re the Watcher and you want one of your own characters to go first, you need to spend doom to do it. It costs at least a d6 doom die\u2014if there\u2019s a hero at the table with Enhanced, Superhuman, or Godlike Senses or Reflexes and you don\u2019t have a character with Senses or Reflexes of that die rating, you need to match either their Senses or Reflexes die with a doom die of the same size. Whether it\u2019s Senses or Reflexes depends on the framing of the Scene; typically, surprise attacks, ambushes, and sudden arrivals hinge on Senses, while a sudden attack from a foe that\u2019s already present and engaged with the heroes would be Reflexes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>page OM37 : INTERRUPTING THE ACTION ORDER<br/><br/>As the Watcher, you can interrupt the action order at any point using doom dice. If a player chooses another player to go, you can spend a die out of the doom pool to have one of your characters act before that next player. Just like the use of doom dice to seize the control of the first Panel in the action order, you have to spend at least a d6 to do this. If the interrupted player has a hero with Enhanced or greater Reflexes or Senses, you have to match that with your Watcher character\u2019s own powers or spend a larger die.</blockquote>\nAre these scenarios correct:<br/><br/>- Villain AND Hero have no Sense/Reflex powers. Villain spends d6 Doom Die to interrupt Action Order.<br/><br/>- Villain has no Sense/Reflex powers BUT Hero does. Villain spends a Doom Die equal to the Hero's Sense/Reflex powers to interrupt Action Order.<br/><br/>- Villain has Sense/Reflex powers EQUAL to the Hero's.

For each step of a the hero's Sense or Reflex power, your villain has to match it with a step in Sense or Reflexes. In your example, the villain has met one of the hero's two steps (d8/d10) with his d8, but not enough to bring it down to a d6. So the Watcher needs to spend a d8 out of the doom pool.<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Cam                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_367094">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367094/#Comment_367094" name="Item_119" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-13T07:05:48+00:00" title="March 13, 2012  7:05AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 13, 2012 7:06AM by buzz.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cam, that seems to contradict the text John quoted from OM36-37.

If Iron Man wanted to create an ambush asset he could totally do that, just roll against the doom pool in the transition scene you were in.

If Iron Man used his turn in the order to set up the ambush, he'd then choose who went next; if we were at the end of the order, he could choose himself. Otherwise, the ambush asset would add to his reaction roll, which then could possibly be a) high enough to beat the villains, and b) generate effect dice he could then pay a PP to use against the villains.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_367212">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MPOSullivan" title="MPOSullivan"><img alt="MPOSullivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/581/nMZWSVRTOY7XL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MPOSullivan">MPOSullivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367212/#Comment_367212" name="Item_127" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-13T12:51:36+00:00" title="March 13, 2012 12:51PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">@stupidgremlin</a><br/><br/>Okay, there's a lot of swing in Marvel Heroic, so there's also going to be a lot of "This is how I would run it", but yeah, this is how I would run that...<br/><br/>First question: did you have the player roll against the Doom Pool to re-establish the security system? <br/><br/>If so, then the effect dice from his roll should have gone into creating an Asset for himself. Something like "Jacked In" or "Aware" would have been perfect. One of the things with MH is that there is no such thing as a flat roll. Every time a player picks up the dice he is creating something, whether that's Stress, an Asset for himself or a Complication for another player. There should never be a roll in the game that does not either create new information or alter information already on the table.<br/><br/>Next up: Was it Iron Man's turn, or one of the Villains?<br/><br/>The way you've presented it, Iron Man's hooked into the security systems, monitoring everything. He sees Living Laser and Chemistro coming down the hall to the security room. I'm guessing that the previous player has already "tagged" Tony and it's his turn to act. If so, and his player says "I wait for them to run in and then blast them both in the face with white-hot repulsor!", then he gets nothing additional.   <br/><br/>In this case, you've already telegraphed that Living Laser and Chemistro are coming through that door. If Iron Man took no action, they would still come through that door. Iron Man waiting until they walk in is just color, and pitch perfect superhero comics color if I do say so. The player could have also said that he "blasts through the door, striking the villains on the other side with repulsor blasts!" or "flies through the door, shattering it, as he zooms fists-first into Chemistro!" and it would have fit just as well.<br/><br/>Instead of using his action to attack, a player can use it to create an asset for himself. In this case he could go for something like "Aware" from the security systems, or "Hidden" or something like that, but he has to take the action and roll the dice to get the asset. Or, if he really wants some extra dice and also wants to go this turn, he could go for a push die or stunt off of "Tech Master" instead. <br/><br/>If it's the bad guys' turn then it's a different can of worms entirely. So, Living Laser bursts in, arcing energy all over the damned place. Tony puts together a completely awesome Reaction pool (minimum of 3d10 1d8), stunts in a d8 off of the security system with Tech Master (possibly stepped up to a d10 if LL rolled an opportunity), then throws a plot point into his effect dice to do stress. It's a bit of a risk, but the reward of damaging on a reaction roll is so sweet.<br/><br/>Ultimately, what I'm saying is that there's no such thing as "holding an action" in MH. Everything in MH is resolved by doing. If a player says he waits for the villain to open the door and blasts him in the face, then that's what he's doing. If he wants extra dice for that though, he's got to roll dice or spend plot points. The dice/PP/action economy is awesome as long as you don't ignore it. The adage from Apocalypse World works well here: "If you say you do it, do it". If a player wants an asset, he needs to use an action and roll the dice. If he wants a stunt, he spends the PP.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_367218">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367218/#Comment_367218" name="Item_128" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-13T13:06:45+00:00" title="March 13, 2012  1:06PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/MPOSullivan">@MPOSullivan</a><br/><br/>Yeah, Iron Man rolled against the Doom Pool to reactivate the security systems, and spent a Plot Point to create a longer-term Asset called "SHIELD Access" or something like that, so the other Heroes could take advantage of it.<br/><br/>At the time of this incident, it was Iron Man's turn.

More questions...<br/><br/>1. A player rolls against the Doom Pool. They roll their action, and there some 1s/Opportunities in the result. The Watcher pays some PP to activate those Opportunities to add/upgrade dice to the Doom Pool. Can these added dice then be used for the Doom Pool reaction roll the Watcher is making in response to the action that resulted in the added dice? That's how I played it.<br/><br/>2. The Watcher rolls a reaction and generates some Opportunities. My understanding is that the player can't do anything with those Opportunities at that moment, but they can "carry them over" to their next action roll and get the stepped up push/stunt/asset or resource if they choose to spend the PP. Is that correct? This came up a lot, and had me wishing I had some sort of token to represent these "reserved" Opportunities.<br/><br/>3. If the Watcher rolls multiple Opportunities, does that mean a player can use them to step up a push/stunt/asset multiple times? E..g., three Opportunities means the player can pay PP to add a d12 push die to their roll? If so, what's the PP cost? Or are all the Opportunities kept separate? E.g., they could buy one for a stepped up push die, another for a stepped up stunt, and another for a resource.<br/><br/>4. How do you handle an action that doesn't create anything that can easily be represented by an asset or complication? E.g., in our session, Spidey was trying to grab Lykos' body away from Electro. What happens if Spidey wins? He now has possession of Lykos, but what do we do with his effect die? Or is everything in MHRP an asset, complication, distinction or resource?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368487/#Comment_368487" name="Item_148" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-19T12:08:46+00:00" title="March 19, 2012 12:08PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 19, 2012 12:12PM by jenskot.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My opinions...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: buzz</cite>1.

It's a similar situation as question 1 above.<br/><br/>If the Watcher rolls Opportunities as part of a <b>reaction roll</b>, then the player can buy BUT not immediately use those Opportunities. <br/><br/>It all comes down to timing.<br/><br/>Reaction rolls happen after the acting player rolls, not at the same time.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: buzz</cite>3.

Yes. You do the action roll first. If this increases Doom Pool, the reaction roll will be bigger.<br/><br/>2. Yes. The use of Opportunities is meant to be linked to the next roll. If you activate Opportunities on a reaction, then the benefit would be to your next roll. <br/><br/>3. The rules suggest that you can spend 1 PP to do one thing, but I don't see an issue with multiple expenditures. Note however that the Push/Stunt option isn't to step up but just make it d8/d10. As such, I don't think it stacks.<br/><br/>4. How would you do it in a normal RPG? If he tries to snatch Lykos' body and Electro resists with a reaction roll, and Spidey wins, Spidey snatches Lykos' body IMO. If Spidey then went and hid Lykos' body or did something to make it harder for Electro to snatch him back, then that would be a Asset/Complication.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368510/#Comment_368510" name="Item_150" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-19T13:46:22+00:00" title="March 19, 2012  1:46PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 19, 2012 1:46PM by buzz.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Skywalker</cite>4.

The collective psychic energy of all those deaths created a being called Manhattan, the "spirit of the people". One of his powers is the capability to recall any information from the people inside him which, in game terms, means that he has Master level at all Specialties. If it was just that, it would be easy. But there's a twist: Manhattan doesn't have full control of the people inside him and consequently, the source of the information he recalls. For example:If he wants to answer a question of Physics, there's a small possibility of recalling that information not from an expert, but from the misconceptions of a layman.<br/><br/>Our problem is how to represent this mechanically. We have discussed and came to 2 ideas: (1) Tie the use of his Specialties to a Distinction ("Who's in Control?"), which in those cases would be used as a disadvantage (d4). (2) A special rule (like The Sentry has, in the OM) where, in every use of a Specialty, he would roll the appropriate dice and a d4. In both cases, our rationale is that adding a d4 to the roll, it will act as the "randomizing" effect allowing the Watcher to add complications.<br/><br/>What do you think? How would you handle this? Are we overcomplicating?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_370109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/370109/#Comment_370109" name="Item_153" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-30T01:07:42+00:00" title="March 30, 2012  1:07AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the Distinction idea is the best way to handle it, yeah.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_370120">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/370120/#Comment_370120" name="Item_154" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-30T05:25:56+00:00" title="March 30, 2012  5:25AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the distinction idea. <br/><br/>Sentry also has: \n<blockquote>Limit: Growing Dread.
