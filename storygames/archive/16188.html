I'm also interested in a variety of funky hypothetical classes, powers and mechanical quirks emergent from newer versions of D&amp;D. (Much love for: Ardents, Hexblades, Fightbrains, Laser Clerics, Avengers and Lazy Warlords.)<br/><br/>I'm sometimes curious about combining these: redesigning these funky classes for S&amp;W/OSRIC/etc. However, I wonder if this dives too far into the "superheroic empowerment" spectrum, rather than the "emergent duel of wits" aspects of old-school play, and I may be hacking the wrong thing here.<br/><br/>Let me offer a caveat: I might be more attracted to the minimal ruleset and improvisational ruleset of retro games, rather than the whole package. (I actually want to try more retro style play to better understand it on its own terms.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368985">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368985/#Comment_368985" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-23T11:46:05+00:00" title="March 23, 2012 11:46AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The on-line community dedicated to what it self-identifies with old-school play's typical response would be: you start as a mage.

It's just going to be detail that you develop yourself through play, with no preplanning of character development (which is something I hate so much myself that it's basically gonna be a dealbreaker when it comes to D&amp;D variants). This works best with a simple class system - most editions of D&amp;D have too many classes, it gets constraining for no reason.<br/><br/>I'll explain how I manage to "support" the modern sort of mechanical complexity and quirk while still being simple at the core in my own house game:<ul><li>All characters begin with a base character class. There are just a few of these, and they're very generic. Each depicts a core lifestyle; in fictional terms the reason why classes exist and multiclassing doesn't is that each character class represents an exclusive set of life and training choices that requires a specific lifestyle to maintain it. Fighter (martial artist - the guy's dedicated to violence), Sage (a civilized upbringing and background) and Adventurer (no real focus, but lots of moxie) are the three classes we've seen most, although I've been speculating about an Ascetic class as well.</li><li>Specific characters will get more specific about their concept within a character class (or outside it, to a degree) by possessing "Initiations", which are essentially Feats, except rooted in the fiction and always interesting and impactful instead of being mechanically weak-ass. So if you specifically wanted to play a raging barbarian or whatever, you'd probably pick up Initiations like "Berserk" or "Tough Fucker" or whatever. You can pick one to start with if you have some idea of the character you want to play, and you can get more of these through play. There's a bit of loose mechanical pacing guiding players in collecting these Feat-lookalikes: when you level up you get to pick a new Initiation if you have less of them than your level, and if the GM thinks that you're getting overboard he may require you to pick and discard enough to get you down to your level. (The latter hasn't happened yet, so apparently it's not a practical problem.)</li><li>Many character class abilities and Initiations tend to max out in mechanical and fictive ways around level five. For example, you can only get a +5 to hit bonus from mundane skill, so the Fighter class sort of plateaus at that level - you can still gain xp normally and even level up, but many of your numbers won't improve further. However, a 5th-level character gets to add "prestige class" type further definition to what they're doing; should be pretty obvious at this point if the guy's worthy of being a holy knight or a kungfu stylist or whatever. Or maybe just a boring dual-class thing, you start improving yourself in some other base class. Whatever, the point is that while most of the things you can do tend to max out, you get new things to do - and most importantly, these new things may be selected from more fantastic options, all depending on the character's fictional positioning. The initial options for almost everybody are mundane, and the magic Sages wield is weak and masochistic (really, I've fucked over the wizard every seven ways), but once you get to these levels I'll be more than happy to deal with your character on a heroic level: by all means, let's design that "Hexswordshadowblade" class chassis at this point, evidently your character's doing something exceptional at these levels.</li></ul>\nThe above basic framework tries to be my own compromise between many, many design issues that people constantly complain about with D&amp;D. There's mundane vs. exceptional, fighters vs. wizards, class logic, organic character development and many other things going into the pot. So far it's working pretty well, the first characters are just about figuring out whether they're going to retire at the 5th-level mark or look for new ways to improve themselves. There's nothing preventing characters from developing into lasersharks over time, either mechanically or color-wise: there are some characters who are played in pretty complex ways already at low levels due to tricky combinations of e.g. initiative tricks and magic, and, well - to be completely frank, <i>most</i> of our characters start to feel pretty cool and special over time simply because the background setting is so mundane that they don't need much in the way of 4th edition glitter to seem heroic. It's more of a chivalric romance for most characters, but some do flirt with modern fantasy color.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_369003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369003/#Comment_369003" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-23T14:55:00+00:00" title="March 23, 2012  2:55PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dev, you might want to take a look at <i>Adventurer, Conqueror, King</i>.

I mean, pretty much the entire point of old D&amp;D character classes is in how their strengths and relevancy is asymmetrical over different scales of play. If you just mechanize 4th edition classes OSR-style you'll still have 4th edition classes in terms of strategic impact: your classes will just be different types of fighters, all asserting their supremacy on the battlefield with slightly different fighting techniques.<br/><br/>For this reason my advice for translating 4th edition character classes to OSR D&amp;D would be to make almost all of them into various special Fighter options (whether Feats you pick as you level up or in-fiction initiatory specialties or something you buy from trainers - whatever): most 4th edition characters are basically irrelevant on other strategic scales aside from a single skirmish, so the bulk of what they bring to the table is going to be various ways for dominating a battlefield. Of course you could have a bunch of character classes that all fill the Fighter role by having a bunch of specialties for fighting, but wouldn't it be more fun to just allow your Fighter-playing players to pick and choose from this stuff as play proceeds instead of locking themselves down into a specific load-out in advance?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_369012">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369012/#Comment_369012" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-23T15:39:27+00:00" title="March 23, 2012  3:39PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 23, 2012 5:17PM by Jogesh EZ.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah. True old school started from the basics and PCs became strange (and awesome) if they survived.<br/><br/>However, if you want to capture the spirit of that without devoting 9 months to 9 years for a campaign to go through that accretion, I think it's fair to start off strange.<br/><br/>The main limits are put to the table. Is it cool? Does it fit our fantasy world?  The second might be hard because the idea of a fighter that is a wraith mummy who uses her wrappings for whips might initially draw a "no" but that was something that I heard about in a campaign that had been going on for years (and the character levels were now in their 40s I believe. Edit: Actually, I think some characters were in triple digit character levels and there was a wide range of levels spread across characters - if your character died you started at 1. Although given the power levels and XP sharing, you blew through the low levels.)<br/><br/>Maybe it was just the OGs I knew, but there was very little editing if something was fun or funny or cool.  As another example of the ethos, one GM had a famous Dungeon that was named something like "Tomb of Skippy" but we usually just referred to it as "Skippy."  It was Egyptian themed and Skippy was the pharaoh buried there. (I also think that he wasn't originally called Skippy, but someone made a joke and it stuck. 2nd Edit: And as a result, there ended up being many peanut butter references when played.)<br/><br/>I didn't play a single game with a consistent serious tone until Vampire. And one of my campaigns involved the Spelljamming Scro almost committing elven genocide on the Dragonlance world of Krynn! Joss Whedon's typical mix of darkness and levity is probably a good modern barometer of the tone. Yes, you can have serious moral and life choices to face down, but you still might run into a demon who only speaks in naughty limericks or have a halfling that rides a Saint Bernard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_369022">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369022/#Comment_369022" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-23T15:57:44+00:00" title="March 23, 2012  3:57PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is totally not the topic, but Eric's description of his game's mix of jocular and serious rings a bell.

Maybe not in hardcore OSR, but in some of the games that are a little less OSR and a little more "old school takes."<br/><br/>I'm thinking ACKs, Old School Hack, Dungeon World. Of those only ACKs maybe qualifies as OSR, but they're all riffs on old school to some degree or another. I think all of those have a place for the crazy classes.<br/><br/>To my mind (heavily filtered through DW, so beware) all those classes are completely playable if you can nail down what they do in clear fictional terms, not just mechanical ones. I know when I think of a lot of 4E classes I think of power source + role, which won't do much for older style games. Like Shreyas' example, it's important to clarify what they actually <i>do</i>, fictionally, not just what abilities they have.<br/><br/>The Avenger is one of the best candidates: I can see some fictional lines to draw around what they do v. what the cleric does v. what the paladin does. That's assuming you've got several classes already. It's harder to make the case for the avenger when you're just doing fighting-man, magic-user, thief. But when we've already drawn a line between fighter and paladin, and between paladin and cleric, there's space there to draw more lines.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_369051">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369051/#Comment_369051" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-23T22:02:02+00:00" title="March 23, 2012 10:02PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gamma World is just as Old School as D&amp;D, and it supports lasersharks right out of the box.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_369207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DevP" title="DevP"><img alt="DevP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/818/nB2L0MAZS1OU2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DevP">DevP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369207/#Comment_369207" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-26T08:03:40+00:00" title="March 26, 2012  8:03AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's good to hear both notions here - that is is doable, and that this is also somewhat against the grain of some of OSR thoughts, but also that's fine. Knowing that there's a thread of gonzo to pull on is perhaps worthwhile: I'm looking to fit in odd concepts into my character, and not necessarily Intense Power. I'll acknowledge that some of these funky classes don't have much flavor to everyone (for example: it's easy to see Avenger as merely "divine + striker + blade", but shreyas and I have, through play, attached more meaning to that character, represented in the mechanics but not exclusively there).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_369211">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369211/#Comment_369211" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-26T08:17:46+00:00" title="March 26, 2012  8:17AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>If you just mechanize 4th edition classes OSR-style you'll still have 4th edition classes in terms of strategic impact: your classes will just be different types of fighters, all asserting their supremacy on the battlefield with slightly different fighting techniques.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>Eero why are you threadcrapping</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_369215">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369215/#Comment_369215" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-26T08:40:50+00:00" title="March 26, 2012  8:40AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are also some OSR games that are more gonzo or at least weird fantasy from the start.  One that John Harper introduced me to is <a href="http://www.stargazersworld.com/2012/02/22/into-the-odd/" rel="nofollow">Into the Odd</a>. I rolled up a couple of random characters the other day and got:<br/><br/>* Pox (novice street urchin), with a sharpened broom handle (spear), and a mystical device that allowed him to cast a few spells (snake's venom, couple others)<br/>* [forget her name] (novice skintaker), who skinned a giant ancient scarab thing in the desert and wears its carapace (heavy armor)<br/><br/>Hopefully I'll get a chance to play it soon, so I'll have more interesting things to say.  One thing to keep in mind about OSR, though: making a character more colorful and unique doesn't give them a better chance of survival, so you still want char creation to be super fast, even if it generates weird and colorful chars.  Like: in Eero's games, chars don't even get names until level 3 (right, Eero?).  So yeah, give them weird traits and special powers, but then send them into the meat-grinder of ruthlessly playing to find out what happens.  Pox has 2 HP, as I recall, so he's pretty much food for worms already.  But if you go in with that in mind, then sure, yeah, gonzo away.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_369241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369241/#Comment_369241" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-26T10:21:50+00:00" title="March 26, 2012 10:21AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's not strictly speaking an OSR game (just heavily OSR-influenced), but Madlands (MADcorp) attempts to address this. I wanted crazy and colorful characters but without any sort of character pre-planning (like Eero, I hate that stuff). My solution was to give 'em all the feats. Every class has a bunch of feats, and they get 'em all right out the gate. I spread all the feats out over a bunch of thematic classes, so now we've got 24 different classes, but they still boil down to archetypes of fighter, magic user, and specialist. It doesn't make starting characters inordinately powerful, either, because starters typically have lower attributes due to 3d6ing, and everyone is pretty darn fragile anyway (well, except the Tank, but that's kind of his thing).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_369589">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/scrapprincess" title="scrapprincess"><img alt="scrapprincess" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/scrapprincess">scrapprincess</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369589/#Comment_369589" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-27T23:12:15+00:00" title="March 27, 2012 11:12PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah I've been trying to kludge for a nice and sweet hack for d&amp;d that lets me make a ton of weird classes real fast that all feel different and you can pretty remember what they do with one skim read.<br/><br/>DevP if yah interest I can send my hacked to the point of no return Blue rose, which is so so much laser sharks.
