I'll be at GTS, if any of you want to buttonhole me on your own behalf or that of some other game that would leave my essay a hollow mockery of a sham by its absence.<br/><br/>Any designer is free to contact me at hit2@mindspring.com, and you guys are welcome to post this to Story-Games or the Forge or whatever virtual smoking section the cool kids hang out in nowadays.<br/><br/>Thanks much,<br/><br/>Ken</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
