I need to make sure that my game time is being used productively, but I have a lot to learn about Story Games and improving play. I think hiring a gaming tutor is a great idea. Why am I wrong? <br/><br/>(Seriously, I think critical commentary of this idea would be interesting and helpful, so don\u2019t hold back).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_337153">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337153/#Comment_337153" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-04T13:13:46+00:00" title="August  4, 2011  1:13PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            if I had more time and less money, I'd be interested, however you would end up being coached by somebody with a different gaming style, not neccessarily better than yours. On top of that that person wouldn't know anything of your group of players and would have to adapt, whatever experience he had previously. Even if you find a suitable tutor, do you think that person has any actual degree in the subject? A professional gaming tutor would need to be some sort of social shrink, actor, entertainer, writer. Perhaps some knowledgement in math and statistics, history and filology would be a good plus. Of course, proficience with the game and supplements would be indispensable, besides of some proficience with any software needed to manage the campaign.<br/><br/>And at all these things the tutor would need to be in a level of mastery that would allow teaching it to others. Most probably you would need a few specialiced tutors instead of a single one. That's more money, but it's all for the sake of making your game experience much better.<br/><br/>Or you can play it as a game and have fun with your friends <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_337155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille" title="Jocelyn Robitaille"><img alt="Jocelyn Robitaille" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille">Jocelyn Robitaille</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337155/#Comment_337155" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-04T13:19:10+00:00" title="August  4, 2011  1:19PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think no sense of community can survive the commercialization of oral tradition / exchange of ideas / shared wisdom.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_337157">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337157/#Comment_337157" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-04T13:25:58+00:00" title="August  4, 2011  1:25PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jocelyn Robitaille</cite>I think no sense of community can survive the commercialization of oral tradition / exchange of ideas / shared wisdom.</blockquote>\nI dunno, schools and places of worship pay their teachers and clerics and manage to maintain a sense of community, at least sometimes.<br/><br/>I'd be fucking great at this job.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_337159">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337159/#Comment_337159" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-04T13:32:26+00:00" title="August  4, 2011  1:32PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm actually a little bit flabbergasted that anyone would need a tutor for playing games.

I don't even know how to describe it. But when I play Catan at home, versus at a con, there's different experiences to a degree, but the core purpose of the game is the same.

One of the reasons I started these threads is due to a podcast I heard on the Walking Eye.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.thewalkingeye.com/?p=1229" rel="nofollow">GMing discussion with Clyde</a><br/><br/>On this podcast, Kevin let Clyde rake him over the coals a bit. It was courageous and inspiring. It made me crave the same intensity of criticism. <br/><br/>I already listen to as many podcasts as I can and I play with a bunch with wicked smart folks. But I want to be their friend and serious critiquing can be strenuous on relationships and sometimes just not fun. I want to advance my skills rapidly. I don't even quite know what I lack yet, I've only just gotten to the stage where I realized I could improve.

I think the key is that this training occurs in a group environment, because then you are able to learn how to work with other people so that the group can effectively play the game.  <br/><br/>I've been involved in team-building exercises at the workplace, and they often focus on opening lines of communication and establishing trust. I think they really work if everyone gives it a real effort and engages in the process.  I think that if everyone was invested in this experience, having a tutor in a group environment might not only improve your individual abilities, but the group's overall ability to work together.  And I think that a key element of reliably successful play is mastering those skills in communicating and engaging with the other people at the table.<br/><br/>I don't think your tutor can point out how you can help others, unless your tutor has some experience with the other people.  Having the tutor with the group teaching a game system means that the entire group learns the system, can ask questions, and the tutor, as an outsider, is held apart from the overall group environment.  Again, it's why a workplace often brings in facilitators, because having a co-worker train another co-worker in mutual communication can cause issues of friction, due to interpersonal relationships that occur.  The outsider's advice is kind of like a mediator, it isn't saddled with who forgot to contribute snacks last week, or some such thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_337500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marc_Majcher" title="Marc_Majcher"><img alt="Marc_Majcher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marc_Majcher">Marc_Majcher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337500/#Comment_337500" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-07T06:48:34+00:00" title="August  7, 2011  6:48AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: misuba</cite>People hire athletic coaches all the time.</blockquote>\nAnd, closer to the question, improv coaches for their troupes or teams.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_337846">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337846/#Comment_337846" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-09T13:00:11+00:00" title="August  9, 2011  1:00PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess you could pay someone to mentor you.

However, I will present alternate strategies that might work better for you.<br/><br/>1. Reading. There are a lot of role-playing books out there on how to make the hobby more awesome. I recommend Play Unsafe as a starting point, but there are loads of other books as well. Also, many game blogs.<br/>2. Observing. Sit in on other games with the intention of serious (engaged) observation. Take notes. Come to conclusions based on what you've seen. Develop theories.<br/>3. Interview. Close to tutoring, you can ask others specifically for what they look for in games and what they've seen that has sparked their passions. A few good interviews can clarify much of what you'd learn from a tutor.<br/>4. Classwork. Take an actual class in acting, go to an improvisational group, watch movies from various genres and deconstruct them. Let's face it; if you're hiring a tutor, they would assign you much of this anyway.<br/><br/>It's not so much that you shouldn't hire a tutor, as that is just one way to the knowledge you're looking for.

Are you saying that I shouldn\u2019t hire a tutor because, although it might be awkward, I could still learn mind-blowing fun? <br/><br/>The point of the thread is to come up with reasons why it\u2019s a <i>bad</i> idea. <br/><img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Also, is roleplaying that much like masturbation? Do you masturbate to an audience? Shouldn't you be just as worried about other's opinions in both cases?<br/><br/>I could go all day. Maybe we need tio split to another thread? <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>More seriously though, I think your real point is more like Jason's when he says that I'm already human. Your are pointing out that style is very personal and I should know how to do it without anyone else's opinion. <br/><br/>I disagree. I feel like there are definite techniques that I could learn from others and that just because something is personal doesn't mean that others don't have plenty to offer. I think your analogy, in addition to being hilarious, helps out the discussion. <br/><br/>If someone wants to get really serious about roleplaying or masturbation they can benefit from a tutor. It could be awkward and formalizing the relationship through the exchange of cash might help tamp down that awkwardness and increase the chances of finding a tutor. In each case, the only things holding someone back might be 1). that they don't want to be adult about it or 2) they aren't that serious and are just doing it for fun. Of those last two, it seems like only the latter is fine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_337914">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337914/#Comment_337914" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-09T20:07:04+00:00" title="August  9, 2011  8:07PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, Morgan, I think you're on the right track.<br/><br/>The "individuality" part comes in when you have someone tutoring or advising and they teach you stuff and show you things... and you may or may not like those things, may or may not prefer them to what you do already.<br/><br/>I'm a musician and I often pay people to teach me things and give me feedback.
