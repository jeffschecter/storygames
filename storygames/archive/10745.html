Game art, I think, falls into a few categories.  The biggest two being Illustrations of a thing and mood setting.  Interestingly didn't see too many pictures that were just images of a thing, even though that historically had been one of the primary uses for game art (witness any bestiary or equipment list).  That's probably an artifact of the way the question was asked...it was a bigger scale question, so the answers were the bigger scale art.<br/><br/>It probably isn't a rigorous enough examination to draw conclusions from, but it is interesting that the answers seemed to center more on "where you do it" and "what do you look like while you do it" than on "what you do"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238317/#Comment_238317" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-20T08:10:25+00:00" title="October 20, 2009  8:10AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For what it's worth, this picture was "Hey, why has no one done an updated/reimagined Wizard of Oz game yet?

No, here's this bear pointing a gun at someone. He's got a backpack so he's probably headed somewhere, maybe on the run? His posture suggests that he's protecting the girl (who seems to be crying), and his facial expression sorta tells me he's prepared to go a long way to do it.<br><br>All of this sparks my imagination. There's drama in there, basic human drama (even though he's a bear...).<br><br>There's a Swedish Gamma World clone that's evolved over the years. I quite like the most recent incarnation and have had some ideas about stuff to do in that world. This pic fits perfectly with some of those thoughts - so perfectly that I really can't remember if they I saw it before I had them or not.<br><br>Really glad I remembered it and put it in there, a whisper informed me where it was from which I've always wondered but never asked.

Most pictures are of individual people. I'm not surprised that it's not "people interacting," and apparently everything that doesn't have two people is in one of the categories you mentioned.<br/><br/>The two that sparked interest in me were Ewen's first two, which are from Black Rock Shooter and Touhou, respectively.<br/><br/>The BRS image is amazing because here's this girl, who is wearing skimpy clothing and chained to a pillar, but her expression is absolutely "I am in total control of this situation and don't you <i>dare</i> think of rescuing me" and her eyes are glowing, which is an in-genre symbol of massive power. So she's a mix of helpless fetish object and absolute bad-ass in the opposite forms of what one normally expects (one normally sees bad-ass warrior women devolved into helpless fetish objects by stripping them of their power, whereas this is a damsel in distress being far more powerful than expected.)<br/><br/>The Touhou image is just cool because it's "simply dressed milk-maid medieval girl" falling through a crazy ultra-tech world of light. I see it totally as the half-angel girl raised by humans being brought back to 'heaven' which is actually the computer story system of the advanced alien race DEUS.<br/><br/>The game I was inspired to write, sadly, is probably too long and complicated to actually finish. It involves power tress with 108 powers each, which is ridiculous. Which is sad, because it had some excellent ideas.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_238353">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238353/#Comment_238353" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-20T09:58:47+00:00" title="October 20, 2009  9:58AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have a thing, not sure why, for cute 'n fun properties turned dark and twisted.

I feel like capturing an expressive moment of action is particularly difficult with the still image, especially in photography. It's a little easier with representative arts, drawing, painting, etc. because there's a lot of cultural touchstones to fall back on. I certainly struggle with making images that capture a moment of human interaction beyond the most basic levels. The failures of my attempts are documented by the total lack of it's representation in my publicly viewable work. it's very easy to make interaction images that feel like stilted melodramatic pastiches of real life, or worse, cinema. <br><br>The image i posted is representative of my love of weird kid stuff and Ray Tintori music videos.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg" title="madunkieg"><img alt="madunkieg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg">madunkieg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238494/#Comment_238494" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-20T21:32:32+00:00" title="October 20, 2009  9:32PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 20, 2009 9:39PM by madunkieg.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My first impression was that there was a lot of macho posturing going on, and a fair bit of violence.

There seemed to be a lot of formulaic pop culture reworks, either taking something and making it "dark" or taking two unrelated things and making them fight each other. I wasn't surprised by that.

I chose the pictures I did because they're inspirations for the game I'm working on now (in between other responsibilities).                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_238498">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238498/#Comment_238498" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-20T22:00:41+00:00" title="October 20, 2009 10:00PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 20, 2009 10:09PM by John_Harper.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man, that picture thread was disappointing as hell.

I love some of the imaginative giant robots found among alien races in games like RIFTS, but the system associated with these games tends to be really crunchy, and I haven't found one where the theme or story really gives flavour to the events at hand...in my experience they always tend to degenerate into dice fests, which then inevitably degenerate into a bunch of players flicking through pages of rule books, cross-referencing their kick-ass combos and justifying to one another how they aren't cheating but are just using some ruling that should have been addressed in an errata but hasn't.<br/><br/>This image just gave me the impression of something a bit different in a mecha genre; something in that vein, but where flavour, style and atmospherics have as much impact as the raw destructive potential involved.<br/><br/>My second picture...the kids with the android.<br/><br/>I actually found this while surfing around after finding the first image and it instantly struck a vibe with me. Recently I've been interested in games that explore the notion of humanity; a lot of these games tend to be pretty dark and adult oriented, but this picture made me think about exploring humanity from the perspective of kids.<br/><br/>What do kids look for in friends? What if a kid's conscious mind was transferred into a robot and he just wanted to have friends as though he were still flesh and blood? How would he be treated? How would his robot body make him feel "more than human" or "less than human"?<br/><br/>Kids can be harsh, victimising anyone who's different...how much would an obviously inhuman kid risk to keep the friends he has made?<br/><br/><br/>Maybe there are games like these around...maybe I just haven't encountered them yet. But these are two games that I'd be interested in exploring.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_238530">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238530/#Comment_238530" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-21T07:48:52+00:00" title="October 21, 2009  7:48AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So what ones did people like?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238535/#Comment_238535" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-21T08:33:26+00:00" title="October 21, 2009  8:33AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Elizabeth</cite>Does that look like a kid's game or Zorceror of Zo to you?

Or, rather, there's a fair amount of filtration going on. Basically, if you filter out all th stuff you like, you are indeed left with crap.<br/><br/>1) There a large number of images which are symbolic / evocative rather than realistic: <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>, <a href="/forums/search?Search=%236&amp;Mode=like">#6</a>, <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2312a&amp;Mode=like">#12a</a>, <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2315&amp;Mode=like">#15</a>, <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2331&amp;Mode=like">#31</a>, and so on. Now, of course, the thing about symbolic images is that they will resonate with some people and not others, but I wouldn't classify them as jokes (they're not) or highly specific images (they're open to a wide interpretation.)<br/><br/>2) There are a fair number of images of people interacting, inasmuch as images can show human interactions. <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>, <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a>, <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2310b&amp;Mode=like">#10b</a>, <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2314&amp;Mode=like">#14</a>, <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2317b&amp;Mode=like">#17b</a>, <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2332&amp;Mode=like">#32</a>, <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2335&amp;Mode=like">#35</a>, <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2337&amp;Mode=like">#37</a>, etc. This is not counting the "group photo" pictures, of which there are many, which are not explicitly interactive but definitely imply a relationship amongst the group. Of course, many of the most interactive pictures are from comics (comics, by their nature, being the most dynamic form of static art) which I guess means that they're lumped into the cartoons category. But I don't see how you can look at, say, <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2376&amp;Mode=like">#76</a> and not go "wow! People interacting dynamically with a crazy social dynamic."<br/><br/>So, while on first reading, I bought his categorization, on a second hard look I'm not sure what Jason is on about, really.<br/><br/>I do find it interesting, on this thread, that apparently SG is more inspired by images of landscapes than of characters.

We pick up on the landscapy-y trappings and miss the fact that the characters are why these stories are awesome.<br/><br/>Also, when a city or other kind of setting is really important in a novel or movie, people often say that it was as if the city (or the mountain, or the space station, or whatever) WAS as character.  I'm pretty new to indie games, so there may be great examples of this that already exist (in fact, I'm almost sure there are), but it seems to me that if you want, for instance, a city that is so cool and interesting that it pervades the game at every turn, there should be some kind of mechanic to encourage this, and the city needs some kind of traits and statistics that describe the mechanical effect of living there.  Otherwise, the really awesome setting you pick fades to the background.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html

I'm pretty new to indie games, so there may be great examples of this that already exist (in fact, I'm almost sure there are), but it seems to me that if you want, for instance, a city that is so cool and interesting that it pervades the game at every turn, there should be some kind of mechanic to encourage this, and the city needs some kind of traits and statistics that describe the mechanical effect of living there.  Otherwise, the really awesome setting you pick fades to the background.</blockquote>\nI like this a lot.

Do you have the same feeling about art in game books?</blockquote>\nGood question. Partly, in a game book I'm already kind of  bought in to the character types. If I'm reading Mountain Witch with an eye toward playing it, a picture of a samurai looking fretful is helpful and evocative, because I'm thinking about that kind of character. <br/><br/>But mostly, yes. Landscape pictures get my creative energy going more than characters. D&amp;D books, for example, often have great art. But I'll pass over ten awesome, weirdly-dressed warriors and focus on the picture of a ruined castle or a planar city. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ColinC</cite>I like this a lot.

I guess I see the movie as two men who you would think might have a similar approach to art and life staking out some very different positions where they challenge each other as to what they believe and how they should live and produce art. So it's not so much that I want to play a game where you roll up a Wallace Shawn character--actually, maybe I do, but that wasn't what I was getting at. I'd like to play something that involves telling stories about art and life. My other hotos were meant to evoke a milieu of anarchic creativity--Zurich Dada and American hardcore punk. I don't know how you'd play those games either, but a game that could transport me to those times and places and make me feel like I was participating in a small fragment of the "scene" would be a game I'd very much like to play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_238671">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238671/#Comment_238671" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-21T23:09:23+00:00" title="October 21, 2009 11:09PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just posted some random images I had at hand that I would like to use in a game at some point.<br><br>The temples on spires sticking out of the sea is Guild Wars concept art.

I see a lot of images like that in the thread. This matches my own creative experience. I'm inspired by a desire to explore.<br/><br/>Some of the pictures don't seem to fit this model. I see pictures that juxtapose images that are strongly evocative (like the scissors and blood). I'm curious about these images and why they were chosen. What about these images inspires you?<br/><br/>I keep an inspiration file of images that spark my imagination. The pictures I added are all recent additions to my inspiration file and are connected with concepts I've been working on lately. I've been reading a lot about planetary exploration, and I've long wanted to write a game that approaches it in a somewhat hard science way. The Weimar Constitution picture (from the Anchor atlas of world history) is there because I'm also very interested in how political institutions break down into tyranny. A game whose board was a diagram of the Weimar constitution, the Roman Republic, or the US political system would be pretty damn rad.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238750">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238750/#Comment_238750" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-22T11:11:47+00:00" title="October 22, 2009 11:11AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: bevedog</cite>So it's not so much that I want to play a game where you roll up a Wallace Shawn character ...</blockquote>\n<a href="http://www.enworld.org/forum/dc-gameday-discussion/250097-morning-10a-230p-continuing-tales-westley-buttercup-vizzinis-revenge.html" rel="nofollow">Ta-da!</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_238757">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Blue" title="Blue"><img alt="Blue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Blue">Blue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238757/#Comment_238757" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-22T11:46:47+00:00" title="October 22, 2009 11:46AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Elizabeth</cite>Pssh.

In the game inspired by this map, if you want to explore hate, you walk there. If you want to investigate isolation, you'll have to charter a boat because there's not regular service. That's interesting.<br/><br/>An infographic might also be a place to explore, even if it's not a picture of a place. That's why I put in the diagram of the Wiemar Constitution. Just because the map isn't of a physical place doesn't mean there's nothing to explore in it.<br/><br/>In Trollbabe, you explicitly decide where on the map your character stars.

I had no idea the woman on the bicycle was supposed to be a new Wizard of Oz, for example. I figured it would be something cool, but on its own it looked boring.  There were many like that, they looked like they could be cool if I had any idea what they were about. Then there were others (like the sci-fi looking Angel over the Garden of Eden) that looked awesome and striking enough on their own.<br/><br/>We also saw how bad Google Image search can be. I think many searched like me, searching based on the game concept they had in mind and then picked the best image they could find.

The implication is a creature that, despite still developing, is fully sentient, and just biding its time. Lurking for the time when it is unleashed. Plotting. And it might just be one of hundreds of eggs, each with their own agenda. The game would be called something like <i>Embryo</i> or <i>Gestation</i>, and it's all about the buildup to a single action, with the climax when you hatch and the actions all happen.<br/><br/><a href="http://nebezial.deviantart.com/art/thor-cow-112110462" rel="nofollow">thor... cow</a> by Stjepan Sejic<br/><i>Marvel's version of Thor, as a cow</i><br/><br/>A number of thoughts collide here in ways I haven't fully sorted out (that's why I want <i>you</i> to make the game, not me). Part of it is the whole "Whosoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor" notion, and the idea of a cow being that worthy. Another part is some kind of "sacred cow" idea. Also shades of "thunder cow" and "drop a cow on them". I dunno. Lots going on. There's fun in there someplace.<br/><br/><a href="http://hwango.deviantart.com/art/Cthulhu-s-Approval-76076199" rel="nofollow">Cthulhu's Approval</a> by hwango<br/><i>Cthulhu, giving the thumbs up</i><br/><br/>Something about the "Buddy Christ" version of Cthulhu always appealed to me. I suppose its <a href="http://www.goominet.com/unspeakable-vault/vault/1/" rel="nofollow">been done</a>, but it seems like there is a sit-com game in there somewhere (with a trait called Exasperation, or something like that). Or maybe this drawing is really a mind flayer, which changes its tone quite a bit. A "hijinks and brain sucking" game would be interesting for a session or two.<br/><br/><a href="http://sakura6.deviantart.com/art/Trust-the-Professional-6671448" rel="nofollow">Trust the Professional</a> by Sakura6<br/><i>Lips with a Red Cross logo painted on</i><br/><br/>Like the Thor picture, this one pulls my thoughts in several directions at once (which is probably why I like it). While there is some "healing kiss" stuff going on, the image conjures up a bunch of other stuff. There is some kind of vampiric twist or inversion to it. There is a sort of joylessness about the actual lips, maybe a sense of duty as well. Being a closeup of fairly sultry lips, there is some Freudian stuff there as well. I confess I don't have a great game idea in mind, just a notion that whatever it might inspire someone to make would be a game I would want to play.<br/><br/><a href="http://arcipello.deviantart.com/art/My-Red-Tie-3006638" rel="nofollow">My Red Tie</a> by Daniel Conway<br/><i>Post-apocalyptic tie straightening</i><br/><br/>The only forces powerful enough to survive the apocalypse are not governments, or motorcycle gangs, or Tina Turner and a midget. They are corporations. Even after the Fall (especially after the Fall) the wageslaves need to get to work on time, in their corporate power ties and gas masks. Maybe the players compete for empty status (a la <i>American Psycho</i>) in a world that really is bankrupt. Maybe it's just about getting to work through the endless hordes of mohawked mooks.<br/><br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland" rel="nofollow">Flatland</a> by A. Square<br/><i>Cover of the book</i><br/><br/>A world of a rigid caste system (status based on number of sides), linear assassin babes (women are lines, so are lethal and hard to detect unless they conform to social norms), visitation from other dimensions, serfs that naturally evolve out of serfdom (isosceles triangles becoming equilateral), generational tension (male children have more sides than their fathers, which, if you think about it, means that the society is basically unstable).<br/><br/><a href="http://allanotero.deviantart.com/art/He-is-Thundarr-the-Barbarian-69400274" rel="nofollow">He is Thundarr the Barbarian</a> by Allan Otero<br/><i>Cast of the the cartoon, in a more realistic style</i><br/><br/>Sue me.

That gives us opportunities to make some up. Jonathan Walton recommended a book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/After-Ice-Global-History-000-5000/dp/0674015703" rel="nofollow">After the Ice</a> that I started as part of a project that I'll get back to some day, and it's full of goodness about that. What's interesting to me is that every culture would have been operating in near isolation from other cultures. That means that they all had nearly unique ways of interacting person-to-person. I'd really love to use that to explore different types of morality. And Mammoths are some of the most incredible creatures in history, so I'd like to have a game with them.</p>\n<p><img alt="Vivian Girls" src="http://catbaret.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/henry_darger.jpg"/></p>\n<p>The Vivian Girls are the obsessive work of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Darger" rel="nofollow">Henry Darger</a>, who literally filled his apartment with filing cabinets to contain the thousands upon thousands of pages that he created. The combination of obsession and relatively coherent fiction (as far as we can tell \u2014 there's no compendious publication of the work) in this realm of fantasy is a powerful, personal exploration of ... something. I'd like a game that both represented the personal weirdness of the creator of a world and the world itself. I'm a big fan of Imajica, but the Vivian Girls was not made for publication, and so is directed wholly by the intentions of its creator.</p>\n<p><img alt="Altered States" src="http://www.posteritati.com/jpg/A2/ALTERED%20STATES%20JAP.JPG"/></p>\n<p>I was looking for a good image from Altered States that didn't have any words and couldn't find any. This one was at least in Japanese. John Lilly is a really interesting guy. He's the fellow who first posited that dolphins have human-like intelligence, and this movie is based on actual experiments he did (though his results were less cinematic). We have lots of games where you explore stuff and places. Exploration of the mind and ourselves is less common. This could be played with Shock: but I think it wouldn't work spectacularly well.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, my first image:<br/>\n<img alt="AWESOME" src="http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/1392732/MonkeyRidesATurkey.jpg"/></p>\n<p>... is simply my favorite image on the entire Internet.

You'll hear a lot about the Minoan culture. If you're lucky, you'll also learn that almost all of what you hear is entirely made up.

But, it should be noted, the environment of the Maghreb just doesn't preserve objects as well.
