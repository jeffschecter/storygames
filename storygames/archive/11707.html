Here's the "mantra":<br/><br/><b><i>"Make the character you want to play and f**k game balance," is what I always say. Game balance comes from the Narrator giving everyone equal time, making everyone important, giving spotlight when players need and/or deserve it. Everything else is just math exercises."</i></b>  - John Wick<br/><br/>John's mainly talking about games with balanced point-based style character generation (so yeah, not so applicable for "In a Wicked Age" or whatever) it seems. And yeah, I find myself nodding in agreement.<br/><br/>Sure, there's the tales of abuse: I remember Steve D from RPGNet talking once about a player saying "For my character concept I *need* these boosted stats and abilities for my child-like ancient vampire", and after getting them proceeded to roll all over the other players and fucked up the campaign. So let's say you have that system of trust underneath.<br/><br/>Anyway, I agree for the most part. A player says that they want to be able to do X well, X sounds cool to everyone, but the player can't take X unless they turn their character into a one-dimensional character that can ONLY do X (because of some limitation in the long-range-view of the point-buy system mechanic), then yeah it's up to the Players to think of things they want to do that break the rules, the GM to hand them out, and then for everyone to make sure all the players get even face-time in play.<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261073">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261073/#Comment_261073" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-09T20:04:06+00:00" title="March  9, 2010  8:04PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The way the "mantra" is formulated, it only applies to a very narrow subset of games<span style="color: #CCCCCC;"> (including, yeah, everything from the 90s and probably almost everything from the 80s as well - a very narrow subset of games, as I wrote)</span>.<br/><br/>The subset of games it applies to, we could further split between "games for which it's true" and "games for which it's false".

YMMV and all that.

And so that is where the "unbalanced" system risks disaster -- Judd's example of a 4e game is bang on. Outside of combat, where the GM is (largely without engaging the rules at all, though as long as things are partitioned well, she can use the rules and still succeed) handling scenes and making sure everyone gets to shine, confronting objectives commensurate with their skills. But if you get the battlemat out and run an encounter, the apprentice gets to do nothing but run or die for an hour (a real hour). And a good many games are predicated on a significant fraction of table time being purely mechanical in exactly that fashion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261097">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261097/#Comment_261097" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-09T23:13:19+00:00" title="March  9, 2010 11:13PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rafu</cite>The way the "mantra" is formulated, it only applies to a very narrow subset of games</blockquote>\nThis subset being "Games run by John Wick."

But a character with higher capabilities in basic things like "shooting down spaceships from orbit" or nanotech or memetics or whatnot would have lesser amounts of sorta-metagamey "Theme" powers like "Deus Ex Machina"or "Romance" or such.

And I would like to point out, that while I was a more adept character on paper, the apprentice was the Prince of the Realm and of higher social standing.  Which made for this really interesting dance of in some circumstances, the Master was obviously in charge, in other,more political or social situations, the Prince held sway.  And Jeff and I knowingly designed our characters to do that.  We had a lot of fun with their relationship.  <br/><br/>Burning Wheel is a game where social weight can be the equal of "combat weight", if not sometimes its superior, depending on how the game is going.  <br/><br/>Savage Worlds, oddly, is a game where I've seen characters of different "levels" do just fine in the same game.  Probably because in combat, PCs have a lot of options and can do quite a bit to help another, even if they are basic beginners.<br/><br/>Where it came up a lot, was in a Champions campaign that is still going on for 2 decades.  Often team-ups would happen between characters of different point levels... and sometimes it did feel a bit like a stretch to make things interesting for the stronger, and yet still challenging without overwhelming the younger/less point PC.  Sometimes, it was the weight of a PC being played more, having more story hooks, knowing more NPCs that could overshadow newer PCs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261142">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261142/#Comment_261142" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-10T07:45:31+00:00" title="March 10, 2010  7:45AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To get jargontastic, game balance is about making sure every player has the same opportunity for resources and positioning so that a player doesn't feel like her character is being deprotagonized. <br/><br/>1.

It has nothing to do with spotlight or navatarism*. Jesus christ, put down the Kool-Aid.<br/><br/>Balancing a game ensures that the choices in the game are meaningful and no one choice is obvious. You can purposely create unbalanced elements, but that's something else entirely. I'm not talking about player skill/preferences, handicapping or difficulty levels.  To wit:<br/><br/>Imagine if Starcraft was designed so that the Protoss were stronger than the Zerg. The game wouldn't be properly balanced. I'm given a choice and there is a right answer and a wrong answer on which faction to play (and if you choose the Zerg you'll probably lose).<br/><br/>In D&amp;D, the choice between a long sword and a dagger is obvious. They are unbalanced at first glance. But factor in size restrictions, weight and special abilities (like those of a rogue pertaining to a dagger) and you see why the dagger is in the game.<br/><br/>In chess, both players have the same pieces with the same capabilities and the same board layout. If it's timed, they start with the same amount of time on the clock. The only factor is in who gets to move first, which is done via a random method. Once the game starts, the players make decisions based on that initial setup. If I started with an extra knight, then the game balance would be off.<br/><br/>Some games, like LARPs, are incredibly hard to balance because player skill is involved. Vampire LARP, for example, involves player personality as a deciding factory in gameplay. I can be matched in a contest against a meek and shy player, thus giving me an advantage. Or I can be put up against the Storyteller's girlfriend, at which I'm at a considerable disadvantage. Doubly so if I want to try and get her into bed.<br/><br/>See?<br/><br/>- J<br/><br/>*I just made that term ("Navatarism") up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262364">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Upstart" title="Upstart"><img alt="Upstart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/303/n8GYZQSU6A1IL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Upstart">Upstart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262364/#Comment_262364" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-16T16:35:41+00:00" title="March 16, 2010  4:35PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Posted By: HalfjackIf a large fraction of the game is going to play out using a purely mechanical subsystem, then that fraction of the game CANNOT be managed by the GM's spotlighting skills -- it's by definition managed mechanically. And so that is where the "unbalanced" system risks disaster -- Judd's example of a 4e game is bang on. Outside of combat, where the GM is (largely without engaging the rules at all, though as long as things are partitioned well, she can use the rules and still succeed) handling scenes and making sure everyone gets to shine, confronting objectives commensurate with their skills. But if you get the battlemat out and run an encounter, the apprentice gets to do nothing but run or die for an hour (a real hour). And a good many games are predicated on a significant fraction of table time being purely mechanical in exactly that fashion.<br/>\n<br/>\nYup. Point-buy systems totally lose their meaning, if they don't really measure effectiveness. And when a GM balances the game, either the rolls lose their meaning or then the game fiction becomes partially independent of the GM. Usually it's the rolls which lose their meaning, as GM just overlooks them and makes the players do the test again until he sees the result he wants. Or then he lets the rolls have impact, but tailors the in-game challenges to match the skill level of individual players. This is really as hard as making a balanced system by yourself, as you have to measure effectiveness, something that the system failed to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think anybody who has some imagination can make an RPG with shitloads of variety. Making a balanced game is even easier (every conflict's a coin toss, for example). But making a game that offers both the variety and the balance? That takes actual effort.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_262387">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262387/#Comment_262387" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-16T19:56:13+00:00" title="March 16, 2010  7:56PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jared A.

It doesn't have anything to do with feelings. It has to do with forcing optimal vs. suboptimal decisions. The bastard sword is more or less the best weapon in D&amp;D (versatility, damage, proficiency bonus, etc.). What makes it a non-obvious as a choice of weapon is that it will eat up a feat slot for you to learn to use it. Now it's the best weapon but there's a price for using it.<br/><br/>Compare this to the old old old version D&amp;D where you had less than a 40% chance to hit with A Weapon (two-handed weapons did same damage as one-handed, maces did as much damage as swords - 1d6). But if you used flaming oil, your damage went up to 1d8, the accuracy was 50% and it was a ranged attack. We as players figured this out and threw away our melee weapons, opting for flaming oil instead. Yeah, it was expended upon use but it was still waaaay better than using a sword.<br/><br/>What you do with your character is your business. Wick complains about his half-orc bard concept that always gets quashed because the half-orc gets a low CHA bonus but John plays that character because he wants to.  His character is going to suck more than say, a half-elf bard. This will make Johnn sad (?) because he made a sub-optimal choice. Part of the skill/mastery of D&amp;D is learning how to play the game well, which is something missing in many roleplaying games. "Playing well" in D&amp;D is a measurable metric. You choose complementary feats and powers and a race/class combination that takes the best advantage of these choices. There isn't an obvious build, per se, but there are some that are better than others. Making a bad character isn't a measure of an unbalanced game. It's ok to let players play the game poorly. However some games (Exalted) have similar traits that simply MUST be taken if you're to play the game with any reasonable expectation of surviving or being successful (Ox Blood Heart or something like that? Basically enables you to survive attacks). That's not good game design.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_262399">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262399/#Comment_262399" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-16T21:58:24+00:00" title="March 16, 2010  9:58PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jared A.

John's half-orc bard would be a perfectly viable character in such games.

AD&amp;D had two (ostensible) balancing factors - top heavy vs bottom heavy, and advancement rate. You could have a character that's more powerful than others to start, but it doesn't get much later and ends up weaker. Or a character that's more powerful to start but advances slower as a result. I'm not hugely keen on it, but it certainly works in some ways. It creates a game where if you go across 15 or so levels with everyone, each character type has a time to shine. Fighters, Priests and Thieves get the spotlight early on. Druids and Wizards get pretty wicked advancement from levels 7-11, where they accelerate past everything else, and then slow back down.<br/><br/>It is a balancing factor, but it only works out in certain ways, and if you play long enough to realise it. If you're starting at a certain level, or at first level, and only playing a short adventure, you might as well write some classes off. A Druid gets really interesting if you can hit 7th level, and that's also when the Wizard gets some powerful spells. If you're only playing levels 1-5 there's no reason to play either.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_262729">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262729/#Comment_262729" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-18T10:02:13+00:00" title="March 18, 2010 10:02AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 18, 2010 10:03AM by Tristan.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Well, you can have D&amp;D combat without requiring that everyone be optimal, and there are D&amp;D games I've played in where one guy was optimizing like crazy and everyone else wasn't and the optimizer was the one seen as the troublemaker/spoiler of the game.

The more versatile a game is, the more we can leverage our understanding of each other and our current goals to make that game ideally suited for us.

The way you would cook a pecan pie is <i>entirely wrong</i> for a chocolate pie, and equally wrong for kiwi.<br/><br/>The point being, <i>pie is too important to use as a strained metaphor for game systems.</i>  Seriously, you want to mix metaphors with the dessert cart, go pick on cakes or cookies or ice cream or creme brulee or some bullshit like that, because pie is too good for this.<br/><br/><br/>If you have to think about pie just to stay interested in a discussion like this, though, I can't say I blame you.  In which case, here's a slightly better analogy:<br/><br/>You may think "Oh, key lime pie, I fucking LOVE key lime pie," and then when you take a big bite of it you find out it was not the particular kind of key lime pie you love.  Because, duh, there are lots of different recipes for key lime pie, and if you never asked which recipe was used for THIS one, you were courting disappointment to begin with.  You didn't get the pie you wanted, but at least now you know to ask for the right kind of key lime pie.<br/><br/>You might also think "Damn, I wish I could get the exact pie I want, but no one serves it here."  In which case you either learn to love the pie you can get, or you move to a more cosmopolitan pie community, or....<br/><br/>You might get together with your friends and say, "HEY EVERYBODY, LET'S MAKE US SOME MOTHERFUCKING <i>PIES</i> IN HERE!", then spend some time figuring out just what kind of pie you're in the mood to eat, and then tweak the recipe so as to get the best pie you can from the ingredients you have on hand.  If you had your heart set on a store-bought pie that you just had to open the box and eat, this won't work for you...but if you think that spending time in the kitchen with your buddies is good fun (plus, dude, there's going to be PIE when you're done), this'll work for you.  And having lots of recipes and a willingness to experiment certainly helps.<br/><br/><br/>When it comes to games, learning to ask the right questions so as to avoid unpleasant and disappointing surprises is an ongoing process.  You can't always get a game that's perfect for you and your current mood right out of a box (though if you can, you fucking win forever and ever, because seriously, that's awesome for you); by and large, though, you have to deal with whatever options actually exist in your neighborhood.  And since that's the case, good communication + a versatile system + some fun "work" can get you pretty close to perfect.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_262829">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262829/#Comment_262829" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-18T14:10:17+00:00" title="March 18, 2010  2:10PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you like key lime pie, you'll know which bakery makes a good one. 9 times out of 10 that's good enough.<br/><br/>If you like cooking, and only your own key lime pie hits the spot for you, by all means make your own.

And that, like baking the perfect pie, is a process that varies by location and altitude and local weather and personal taste.  There's really no such thing as universal perfection here, just local perfection.  Chasing universal perfection is for suckers, and if it keeps you from focusing on your own table, it's the worst thing you can possibly do.<br/><br/>So I don't really think it's a shame at all that you don't get to share in our awesome fun, because you have your own awesome fun to make with your own friends which I won't share in.  That's how the world works, and I think we can all be okay with that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_262851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262851/#Comment_262851" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-18T14:58:18+00:00" title="March 18, 2010  2:58PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's really a thing about how well recipes are written, myself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262859/#Comment_262859" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-18T15:09:25+00:00" title="March 18, 2010  3:09PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 18, 2010 3:10PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I would submit that in gaming, there's always an X factor that can't be written down.  For god's sake, just look at all the people who love PrimeTime Adventures.  I've read that book, it's great.  I do not doubt the many people who have told stories about how much fun they had playing PTA, and I cannot possibly claim in good faith that it is a poorly designed game.<br/><br/>But it is absolutely impossible for me and my friends to play PTA and have it not be a buzzkilling non-fun catastrophe.  We know what we're doing (at least, we do in general, and we certainly worked our asses off trying to get better at it), we have the best of intentions, but whatever it takes to play PTA and have it be entertaining and satisfying and a great time, <i>we simply do not have it.</i>  The sort of fun it provides is not to our taste, I guess; whatever combination of personalities and preferences you need to sit down and have such a good time that you cannot wait for the next episode, we cannot provide, and there's fuck-all that the rulebook (as great as it is) can do to provide that to us.<br/><br/>And that's just how gaming is, really, and (I think) it's part of what makes it such a great hobby; because what happens at the table is <i>unique to us</i>.  It is ours, and ours alone.  We own our successes (and our failures) in a very personal way, and I like that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_262874">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262874/#Comment_262874" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-18T15:46:08+00:00" title="March 18, 2010  3:46PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love a good steak-and-kidney pie, but some people just don't like offal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262894">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes" title="frozenwastes"><img alt="frozenwastes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/062/nIVJF3PC5XJ0G.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes">frozenwastes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262894/#Comment_262894" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-18T17:17:22+00:00" title="March 18, 2010  5:17PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>"Make the character you want to play and f**k game balance," is what I always say.
