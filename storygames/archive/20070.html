He's a highschool student and has the DETAIL "Crush on Heather". I TRANSFORM this detail into a PATH (PLOT). Gerry now "plans to go with Heather on a date".<br/>BETH &amp; CARL agree enthusiastically. They REFINE Heather's character, adding DETAILS (appearance etc....).<br/><br/>###<br/>SCENE A, Step 2: Set Scene<br/><br/>ANDY: So, let me set up the COMPASS:<br/><i>Ambience:  light o X o o dark<br/>Chance:  predictable o o X o surprising<br/>Scale: intimate X o o o large<br/>Weight: trivial o o X o crucial<br/>Mood:  silly o o o X serious<br/>Pace: slow o X o o fast</i><br/><br/>CARL objects: Noo, not intimate... Let's put the scene in a public place, like the school hallway, it will be more awkward!<br/>ANDY: ok, I like the idea<br/><i>Scale: intimate o o o X large</i><br/><br/>ANDY: So, we have <br/><i>Plot: Ask out Heather on a date (Path)<br/>Location: At lockers in school hallway<br/>People: Gerry &amp; Heather, with half the school watching<br/>   Q1 (Question 1): Will Heather say "yes" to the date?</i><br/>BETH: How about<br/><i>   Q2: How smooth will asking her out go?</i><br/>ANDY: cool.<br/><br/>###<br/>SCENE A, Step 3: Resolve Scene<br/><br/>ANDY: So, any ideas how we're resolving Q1?<br/>BETH: Oh, she definitely should say "yes"!<br/>CARL: Don't let him get away so easily. How about a HARD CHOICE?<br/>ANDY: Great, let's give him a hard choice...<br/>After brainstorming, Beth/Carl agree on:<br/><i>   Q1 Hard Choice: Heather does say "yes" to the date...<br/>   ... and everybody in the hallway hears it<br/>     or<br/>   ... but she says it's just a "friendship date".</i><br/>ANDY: Uff... that's a tough one... I choose for Gerry that "everbody in the hallway hears it". <br/><br/>ANDY: This leads to Q2. Let's make a RANDOM TABLE!<br/>Andy/Beth/Carl brainstorm a Random Table:<br/><i>Q2: How smooth will asking Heather out go?<br/>1: coolest guy in school<br/>2: he looks stupid<br/>3: she looks desperate<br/>4: awkwardly emberassing<br/>5: kind of cute<br/>6: lacking enthusiasm</i><br/>ANDY: Any favorites? No? Ok, then let's roll... It's a 5!<br/>So, it's "kind of cute"<br/>CARL: And everybody in the hallway hears it!<br/>BETH: Yeah, they all go "ooh..."!<br/><br/>###<br/>SCENE A, Step 4: Perform Scene<br/><br/>ANDY: Ok, I'm gonna play Gerry, Beth is gonna play Heather, we're both SPOTLIGHT ACTORS. Carl, I'm giving you the DIRECTOR role for the performance.<br/>ANDY: Let's just check the COMPASS again... So the scene is kind of serious, kind of tense, right?<br/>BETH: Carl, you can also impersonate some of the bystanding students, ok?<br/><br/>CARL: Ok... action!<br/><br/>(all three in-character):<br/>GERRY: Hey... Heather... eeh... how are you?<br/>HEATHER (pretends she's putting something in her locker, blushes, nervously plays with her hair): Hi Gerry, nice to see you (smiles)<br/>GERRY: Well... eeh... nice day today, hmm?<br/>HEATHER: Yes, mmh lovely.<br/>(awkward silence)<br/>STUDENTS IN BACKGROUND: Hey, look Gerry is hitting on Heather!<br/>(awkward silence continues)<br/>HEATHER: Soo...?<br/>GERRY: Eeeh, I thought maybe... You want to go on a date with me?<br/>HEATHER: Where would you want to take me?<br/>STUDENTS IN BACKGROUND (all by Carl): Ooh, look at that! - Wasn't she dating Johnny? - No, I think they've split up a month ago...<br/>GERRY/ANDY: off-character: damn I didn't think of anything... <br/>GERRY: in-character: Yeeeaah, how about we go to Cindy's Cafe on Friday evening?<br/>HEATHER: (enthusiastically) Yes.... You pick me up at 7, then? Great!<br/>STUDENTS IN BACKGROUND: Alright, so Friday night it is. That ought to be interesting.<br/><br/>CARL: aaand 'Scene' that's it, ok?<br/>Andy &amp; Beth nod.<br/><br/>###<br/>SCENE A, Step 5: Reflect Scene<br/>ANDY: Ok, so what was most<i> enjoyable about the scene?</i><br/>BETH: I liked the background students<br/>CARL: Yeah, it looks like Gerry's gonna get into trouble<br/>BETH: That made it really awkward for him. So, what about the ex boy-friend Johnny?<br/>CARL: Yeah, "Jerk Jock Johnny" is really mean and he's still in love with Heather...<br/>BETH: Sounds cool, that would be a good focus for the <i>next scene</i>.<br/>ANDY: Yes!<br/><br/>###<br/>###<br/><br/>BETH is the new SCENE HOST.<br/><br/>###<br/>SCENE B, Step 1: Nurture Setting<br/>"Jerk Jock Johnny" and Cindy's Cafe are fleshed out (CREATE ELEMENT).<br/>Andy he tells how Johnny used to bully him when they were in elementary school, he performs it as a little detour FLASHBACK SCENE.<br/><br/>###<br/>SCENE B, Step 2: Set Scene<br/>The COMPASS is set to a lighter Ambience/Mood.<br/><i><br/>Plot (Twist): Jerk Jock Johnny shows up on the date<br/>Location: Cindy's Cafe<br/>People: Heather, Gerry, Johnny, waitress Tasha<br/>Q1: How does Johnny's appearence affect Gerry&amp;Heather's date?<br/>Q2: How menacing is Johnny at the cafe?<br/></i><br/><br/>###<br/>SCENE B, Step 3: Resolve Scene<br/>Q1: The group decides to ACT &amp; SEE (decide spontaneously what will happen during performance)<br/>Q2: Resolved with DICE ROLL SPECTRUM:<br/><i>On a d6, scale from 6-1:<br/>5: Johnny get's physically aggessive  / 2: Johnny just complains a bit</i><br/>They roll a '4'. So Johnny's going to mildly push Gerry a bit.<br/><br/>###<br/>SCENE B, Step 4: Perform Scene<br/>Beth doubles both as the character Heather as well as the waitress Tasha (depending on the situation).<br/>Andy get's to be DIRECTOR for the scene.<br/>Carl is the SPOTLIGHT ACTOR as the bully Johnny.<br/><br/>The scene evolves and ends with <br/>HEATHER (splurting out surprisingly): Go away, Johnny, it's really over. I love Gerry!<br/><br/>###<br/>SCENE B, Step 5: Reflect Scene<br/><br/><i>Enjoyable about this scene?</i><br/>The group has enjoyed introducing Johnny and they will keep up the triangle for future scenes. Heather confessing her love changes things.<br/><i>Enjoyable for future scene(s)?<i><br/>Heather having a dark secret Johnny knows about would be cool.<br/><br/>###<br/>###<br/><br/>###<br/>SCENE C, Step 1: Nurture Setting<br/>Heather has a dark secret. A Mystery Plot is created (CREATE ELEMENT) and Johnny knows about it (CONNECT ELEMENTS).<br/>Technically, Beth is the designated SECRET KEEPER. As a player, only she knows (or can make up) Heater's secret for now.<br/>...<br/>...</i></i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
