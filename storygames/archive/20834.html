I've had some half-formed thoughts on making good tables, so I thought I'd share 'em here and maybe the conversation here will gestate into a blog post.<br/><br/>I've got 2 random table uses that I've been enjoying lately - prep and encounter. Both inspire stuff, I think.<br/><br/><b>Prep</b><br/><br/>Prep is there to help me come up with ideas quickly, definitely inspired by <a href="http://www.jwalton.media/planarch-codex/" rel="nofollow">planarch codex</a>. <a href="https://githyankidiaspora.wordpress.com/2013/10/22/lotfp-adventurer-and-salvage-union-of-marsui/" rel="nofollow">I used this in our Marsui game to come up with delving jobs</a>. It led to cool stuff. I found that these are better the stranger and more weird fantasy I make the categories but not too-too weird because blending the categories together will often make them weird enough.<br/><br/>I got a <a href="https://githyankidiaspora.wordpress.com/2013/11/21/4-adventurers-8-cultists-1-priest-1-dinosaur-demi-goddess-30-mercenary-musketeers/" rel="nofollow">dinosaur goddess and her well-to-do cult</a> and <a href="https://githyankidiaspora.wordpress.com/2013/12/10/another-wizard-dead-in-marsui/" rel="nofollow">a crimelord with a magical unicorn horn</a>, so I think it worked out alright.<br/><br/>I liked using these to roll up a bunch of jobs and then finding maps online to go with the ideas.<br/><br/><b>Encounter</b><br/><br/>I used this for our short-lived D&amp;D game but also used it a bit for our lotfp game to see if they ran into any trouble on their way back from delves. As time went on and delving became more lucrative, the chances of running into rip-and-run crews who make their living stealing from adventurers when they are beat up and rich becomes more and more likely.<br/><br/>I made up a table for Big Shire but <a href="http://www.thedarkfortress.co.uk/tech_reports/2_dice_rolls.htm#.WAurwvkrKUk" rel="nofollow">I'm looking at the odds on a 2d6</a> and making up encounter tables for our Stars Without Number game and thinking that over.<br/><br/>I like the idea of the encounters on a table changing as the places change - be it crossing the dragon off a table or adding more and more soldiers as an invading army begins to patrol the area more and more.<br/><br/>So, I've got a dangerous valley outside of town with some kind of presence that is causing wood-cutters to go missing.<br/><br/><b>Forest in Trouble Random Encounter Table</b><br/>2 - Wraith<br/>3 - Gnolls (3d4)<br/>4 - Fungal Beast<br/>5 - Bandits (5d6)<br/>6 - Wood-cutters (3d4)<br/>7 - Wood-cutters (3d4)<br/>8 - Merchant Caravan (3d6 guards)<br/>9 - Satyr pack (2d4)<br/>10 - Fungal Infected Fauna*<br/>11- Young Green Dragon<br/>12 - Strange Incursion*<br/><br/><b>Forest Fauna Table</b><br/>1 - Wolves<br/>2 - Deer<br/>3 - Hawk<br/>4 - Raven<br/>5 - Boar<br/>6 - Elf<br/><br/><b>Strange Incursion Table</b><br/>1 - Githyanki<br/>2 - Slaad<br/>3 - Ethereal Strangler<br/>4 - Elemental<br/>5 - Githzarai<br/>6 - Devil<br/><br/>Maybe if you roll doubles, you roll again and those two encounters are already embroiled in some kind of conflict.<br/><br/>I might make a table to see what the merchants are peddling or to see how many caravan guards they have.<br/><br/>The fungal infection might get worse, the bandit leader might declare themselves a legit lord, the wraith might fall under sway of a necromancer or a strange incursion might take solid root. If so, the table would change to reflect it.<br/><br/>My worry is that I weighed the table too hard on boring wood-cutter encounters but it becomes more interesting when as Adam does in Keep on the Borderlands, we roll every hour of in-game time to see if an encounter comes about, rather than every day or so.<br/><br/>I'm just thinking about making random encounter tables, think about how to use them, reflect on how you've used them in the past and when they worked and when they didn't work so well. <br/><br/>Thanks.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457395">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457395/#Comment_457395" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-22T20:16:07+00:00" title="October 22, 2016  8:16PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing I do in City of Brass is, when I roll an encounter that has come up before, it returns in a more serious way.

I did for a while but as I started spending more time crafting my settings, general random tables stopped making sense.<br/><br/>For a while I built custom tables, but that was a lot of work (I was making a ton of them for each area, so maybe I went overboard).  Now I just have a sheet with a bunch of rough descriptions of different encounters and when I need one, I just grab one and scratch it off.  I fill in the specifics as I go and are scaled to what I need at that particular moment.  They are specific to the setting the players are currently in and fit in properly.<br/><br/>Before the next session, I refill the list.  (This is actually simplified a bit, there are several lists of differing complexity, but you get the idea).<br/><br/>I will read random tables as research and inspiration, but I never use them in play.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457489">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457489/#Comment_457489" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-25T16:56:00+00:00" title="October 25, 2016  4:56PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The <i>DayTrippers GameMasters Guide</i> is chock-full of random tables; not only random encounters but everything from planet and lifeform generation to NPC traits, plot twists and mission objectives.

It's a deep system choice to me!<br/><br/>The questions that random tables attempt to answer are:<br/><br/>* How do I create <b>interesting</b> play content?<br/>* How do I create play content that <b>surprises</b> the players, and even myself?<br/>* How do I create play content <b>quickly</b>?<br/>* How do I create play content <b>consistently</b>, even from GM to GM?<br/>* How do I create play content <b>fairly</b>? <br/><br/>Please note that I am not saying that <i>only random charts</i> solve these problems, and I am not saying that other techniques are unfair. However, different people will have different feelings about how interesting, surprising, quick, consistent, or fair any given technique is.<br/><br/>Personally, I think the random tables in <i>Fiasco</i> are used in a very similar way to how I use them in Basic D&amp;D. They are generating <i>Situation</i>. However, <i>Fiasco</i> does it once at the start of play; D&amp;D does it many times, throughout play. The former is designed as a one-shot game played in a couple hours. The latter is designed as an episodic game played for many hours, many times over and over, in long campaigns.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457521">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457521/#Comment_457521" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-26T19:03:44+00:00" title="October 26, 2016  7:03PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree, Adam.<br/><br/>(I should clarify that I'm using "aesthetic" in a very intentional way, not as a dismissal. Aesthetics are absolutely fundamental to this activity we're engaged in. Much like Colour (in the Big Model sense) sounds like something which is tangential at best, but, in fact, is absolutely vital to your game, whether you like it or not, and how you might connect - or fail to connect - with it. The 'aesthetic' aspect of random tables has to do primarily with their presentation, not their function in serving those notes you've just listed.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457533">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457533/#Comment_457533" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-27T05:19:56+00:00" title="October 27, 2016  5:19AM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 27, 2016 5:20AM by BeePeeGee.">edited October 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>The questions that random tables attempt to answer are:<br/>* How do I create <b>interesting</b> play content?<br/>* How do I create play content that <b>surprises</b> the players, and even myself?<br/>* How do I create play content <b>quickly</b>?<br/>* How do I create play content <b>consistently</b>, even from GM to GM?<br/>* How do I create play content <b>fairly</b>? <br/></blockquote>\nThese are good points, Adam. I find <i>consistent</i> and <i>fair</i> important in the creation process, such as character creation or city creation etc.<br/><i>Surprising</i> and <i>quickly</i> is important to me during game play, especially with collaborative story games that otherwise end up with a predictable development.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
