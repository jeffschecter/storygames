I can think of a few instances of regular Pool refreshment that the players might implement (sharing a drink at the bar with your comrade after a freaky day; challenging a track star to a race around the track, winner gets to ask questions; sitting in on an advanced physics lecture). However, I had an idea on the way into work this morning for an alternate (not necessarily replacement) Pool refresh method.<br/><br/>What if you could refresh your Pools by grabbing an NPC and engaging an investigator with (predetermined?) clues but also specifically in an Area of Expertise of theirs (aka, spotlighting one of their cool factors; a high Ability, a Secret, etc.) Also, a second thought, not necessarily mutually exclusive, helping an investigator hit a Key? How would either of these (or both in a synthesis) affect gameplay?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133693">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133693/#Comment_133693" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-10T08:31:43+00:00" title="March 10, 2008  8:31AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Mark,<br/><br/>I'm not sure I understand your idea.   I'm assuming that you mean a player temporarily plays an NPC talking to another PC ("an investigator")- is that right?  Could you restate it with an example? <br/><br/>I tend to think refresh scenes are really important to the tone of the game, and generally use them as the inactive "catch your breath" moment between more active scenes.  Often for our group they involve role-playing without any dice-rolling conflicts, but hitting Keys is certainly possible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133716/#Comment_133716" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-10T09:46:10+00:00" title="March 10, 2008  9:46AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, an example:<br/><br/>Let's say that there is a gate to another world hidden on campus. I've got quite a few little hints and clues as to some things to investigate. When a player  wants to do a refresh, but might not be able to think of something that they want to introduce into the fiction that would fulfill the refresh, they could take an NPC and have their character "go rest for a moment". They choose someone to spotlight (Agent Alvarez, in this case) and I would give them a prepared card (targeting her post-cognition Secret) with three clues to possibly reveal. The player has chosen the loner kid that hangs out on campus at night while stargazing or writing emo fiction or something. Say that player then chose the clue that involves weird lights at night, and then, as this NPC, approaches Agent Alvarez and speaks to them privately.<br/><br/>So, by involving them more in the witnesses and the mystery, and making NPCs less of a mouthpiece for me, I was thinking that I could spice up a typical investigative mystery.<br/><br/>Does that make more sense? If so, does it seem like it would lead to other problems? Should I just ask the players to do this from time to time and not involve a mechanic? I can see that it might not work well when everyone needs a Refresh.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133737">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133737/#Comment_133737" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-10T10:51:22+00:00" title="March 10, 2008 10:51AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, I think I get it now, and it sounds interesting.  I'm not sure that it <i>needs</i> to be a Refresh mechanic, but it could be.  My take on Refresh scenes is that, in part, they're an opportunity for the GM to introduce NPCs and plot elements in a relatively "safe" way (i.e. not the focus of an immediate conflict, but rather setting up for such conflicts later).  In other words, it's one of the few tools the GM has for shaping the story in TSOY.  If you didn't want to use Refresh scenes, these could just be regular scenes with the players taking on NPC roles for a given conflict.<br/><br/>In our games, we've been pretty free with players taking on NPCs, usually at the direction of the GM.  "Hey Jason, can you play Teddy Roosevelt in this scene, since your PC isn't here?"  Of course, this can lead to the players introducing new twists to the story, which can be good or bad.  Since what you're describing seems to have a fairly rigid back-story (there's a mystery to be uncovered), giving the player at least some concrete plot elements to work with seems like a good idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133758/#Comment_133758" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-10T12:06:33+00:00" title="March 10, 2008 12:06PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting.

The GM needs Refresh scenes to be able to introduce elements quietly, as suggested by the <a href="http://tsoy.crngames.com/Tips_and_Tricks" rel="nofollow"><em>Tips and Tricks</em></a> section of the rules:\n<blockquote>Use pool refreshment like a rock star. Your best chance to introduce some new characters in the game is by making player characters meet them in order to refresh a pool. If a player says, "I need to refresh Reason," and doesn't say how, she's begging to be clubbed with your imagination.</blockquote>\nRefresh scenes are a GM tool like Key Scenes, giving him some control of the story.  I make it sound like the GM has no authorship, but in my experience, TSOY players can easily take off with the stake-setting part of a conflict and drag the story around wildly.  Conflicts are usually fast-paced and dynamic, especially with BDTP.  However, since we don't usually have conflicts in Refresh scenes, the result is a "quieter" scene suitable for foreshadowing or revelations about characters.<br/><br/>* <small>Really, it's ridiculous how long I've been playing this game and how often I realize I've been "playing wrong"</small> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133794">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133794/#Comment_133794" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-10T13:40:09+00:00" title="March 10, 2008  1:40PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To come back to Mark's original question, I think Refresh scenes would work really well for dropping clues to the mystery, whether through an NPC or not.  <br/><br/>Example: one of the players says "My investigator, who's a little shaken after hearing those spooky noises, is going to find a quiet place to calm his nerves.  I'm looking to Refresh my Instinct"  The GM could respond "Okay, that sounds great- the library is just around the corner, and there's nobody in there.  You settle yourself into the stacks and take a breather.  After a few moments, you look around and notice a strange book that stands out from the rest- it looks like a diary..."<br/><br/>The end result is a fresh Instinct pool and a PC with a handy clue to carry him on to his next scene.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133871">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/oliof" title="oliof"><img alt="oliof" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.mausdompteur.de/gravn32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/oliof">oliof</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133871/#Comment_133871" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-10T20:03:19+00:00" title="March 10, 2008  8:03PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Refresh scenes are a good way to introduce SGCs that later become important as adversaries or people to care about.
