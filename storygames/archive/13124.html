The scale is irksome, in that this aspect of the mechanics left me wondering when I, the Resolver, should intervene with content. <br/><br/>The advice from the text is negative - rather than saying "Do this," it says "Don't do this." That's totally fine, of course. And it goes like this: \n<blockquote><b>Fiasco said (p. 29):</b><br/><i>just avoid scenes that are aimless, don\u2019t advance the plot in an interesting way, or are self indulgent. You don\u2019t get very many scenes! Make them count. Be bold.</i></blockquote>\nOkay, I can dig it. My only frustration, I guess, is that there's only one fulcrum in the conflict of a scene. I think it's fine to limit yourself to one conflict per scene - - unless you want to layer an argument (whose outcome matters) into a firefight or something (whose outcome presumably also matters). But if I'm playing Polaris, a fight scene brings on a series of negotiation about the narrative, wrestling over details and broad strokes alike. <br/>With Fiasco, I get just one shot. And I wanna know how other people feel about this.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_295868">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295868/#Comment_295868" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-04T16:51:08+00:00" title="October  4, 2010  4:51PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The rules actually say that the decision is about "where that character has a good or bad outcome in the scene" (I'm paraphrasing).<br/><br/>So the scene can still go in any one of many directions.

I assume so, since you said "one person".<br/><br/>Those scenes are often more fun for me in Fiasco, because the game is asking you to be as mean as possible to that player's character. If someone chooses to resolve and gives themselves a positive outcome, then the other players should totally put that dude's character in the trunk of an El Camino, bound in high-test fishing line, with a soiled wad of hundred-dollar bills in his mouth, regardless of what has come before.<br/><br/>The fun in those scenes is the creative energy expended by the player trying to work out what happened and how on earth it's going to end well for his character. The fact that the outcome is a foregone conclusion doesn't keep it from being exciting, it's what lets it be exciting.<br/><br/>For my money, anyway.<br/><br/>Also, I'm with Chris in that some non-conflict scenes are okay in Fiasco, esp. if they give other players some new plot elements to work with.<br/><br/><sub>* Fiasco is also one of those games that came effortlessly to me, for whatever reason. I think most people have some games they click with, and others they have to work at. Maybe we can get a session together at Ice Station Nerdly if something falls through.</sub> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_295872">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295872/#Comment_295872" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-04T17:40:24+00:00" title="October  4, 2010  5:40PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, so the Resolution only affects a single PC. Polaris limits conflict to a similar scope, more or less.<br/>As far as the "two NPCs" conflict, I will quibble and say that because it holds the interests of PCs at stake, it is a PC-based conflict. Even if the PCs are miles away from the activity in question, at least one player has a strong stake in the situation, and thus the mechanics need to have a way (in any game, not just Fiasco) for players to intervene in any conflict that involves them. <br/><br/>I'm just rambling, though - obviously, Fiasco can do that. <br/><br/>I'll admit that I've only played Fiasco once, and it only involved me and one other person. That was, no doubt, a huge factor as to why the game felt kind of diffuse and a little hiccupy in terms of producing content. I think it'd shine a lot better with three or four players, and it seems, on reflection, like the main reason why we struggled was for want of enough cooks in the kitchen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_295895">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295895/#Comment_295895" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-05T04:48:16+00:00" title="October  5, 2010  4:48AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Zac, thanks for starting this thread! \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zac in Davis</cite>I'll admit that I've only played Fiasco once, and it only involved me and one other person</blockquote>\nFiasco is a game for three to five players. <br/><br/>Scene resolution is explicitly, emphatically, not about conflict. There is no conflict resolution. It is about outcomes. The only decision to be made, either by yourself if you choose to resolve or by your friends if you choose to establish, is whether the scene's outcome is going to be positive or negative for your dude.<br/><br/>You can have a positive outcome and lose, lose, lose. You can have a negative outcome and stomp the opposition. Getting the thing you want by killing someone is generally a negative outcome - your dumb character is happier for the moment, but they just murdered someone, which is probably not going to go well for them. Related to this, once you know the general tenor of the scene's outcome, there can be any number of conflicts, moments, interactions, fights, whatever needs to happen to support the fiction in the scene. Sometimes (usually), a scene will be a scene, but sometimes it will stretch out a bit and breathe, include cut-aways to other characters, flashbacks, a couple of different interactions, and so forth. Groups find their own rhythm.<br/><br/>The precise definition of positive and negative are going to vary widely, both from scene to scene and from group to group. Leaving this utterly ambiguous was a conscious design choice. The choices you and your friends make will inform play and make the game do what you want - that's my hope, and it seems to work pretty well. At its core Fiasco is a structured freeform game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_295938">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295938/#Comment_295938" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-05T10:11:43+00:00" title="October  5, 2010 10:11AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zac in Davis</cite><br/>I'll admit that I've only played Fiasco once, and it only involved me and one other person.
