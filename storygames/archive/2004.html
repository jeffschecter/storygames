                    Alejandro Jodorowsky is a Chilean-born Frenchman who mainly makes crazy movies and, these days, funky surreal sci-fi comic books.  He is awesomely crazy.<br/>
<br/>
<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.duneinfo.com/unseen/jodorowsky.asp" rel="nofollow">Once, the Divinity agreed to say to me in a lucid dream: "Your next film must be Dune." I had not read the novel. I lifted myself to a height of six o'clock in the morning and as an alcoholic who awaits the opening of the bar, I waited until someone opens the bookshop to buy the book. I read it of a feature without me stopping for drinking or eating. At midnight exactly, the very same day, I finish the reading. At one minute pass midnight I called from New York, Michel Seydoux in Paris... He would be the first of the seven samurai that it was necessary for me to have for the immense project.</a>  (edited to add: this is the most insanely great movie I've ever heard of.  I wish it existed.)<br/>
<br/>
Man, I wish there was a game that captured the Jodorowsky style of telling a story.  I think there's some RPG about the Metabarons, one of his comics, but it kind of sounds like a franchise knock-off that doesn't really get down to business and reach the good stuff that makes this guy who he is.                </div>

                            I only have the first collection.  It's basically like Warhammer 40,000 meets Dune meets Heavy Metal opera, with crazy comments thrown in.  Essentially, this dynasty of people engage in ritual mutilations and get wacky cybernetic ass-kicking gear.  The art, at least in the one I have, is pretty good; the writing is full of crazy concepts but kind of stilted.  It's been a while since I've read it, I'm not sure what it's really about.  I think mainly it involves man's choice between sterile decadence, and the pointlessness of war, and the only thing that matters is determination and self-control.  I dunno.  I'm making that up.<br/>
<br/>
Basically it's fun gibberish.  Basically, click on the link above, read Jodorowsky's version of Dune, and then imagine something very much like it, as a beautifully illustrated sci-fi comic.<br/>
<br/>
But thanks for confirming that the RPG adaptation is as lame as I thought it would be.                        </div>

There's like four paragraphs of setting.<br>Yes, after losing the Star Wars license West End had to look for another setting for their d6 system. Since the new owner of WEG was somehow affiliated with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Humano%C3%AFdes_Associ%C3%A9s" rel="nofollow">Les HumanoÃ¯des AssociÃ©s</a>, the French publisher of graphic novels and the magazine MÃ©tal Hurlant (= Heavy Metal) they simply had to browse their catalog.<br><br>Metabarons was chosen because of the (relative) similarity to the Star Wars franchise - big starships, huge space battles, a mysterious order of fighting <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">knights</span> assassins, and on top of that they already had truckloads of beautifully painted artwork.<br><br>The RPG rulebook was notorious for its format - it didn't fit the shelves of most stores. But it was very nicely illustrated (by Juan Gimenez), and (IMHO) a fitting replacement of the Star Wars RPG. The rulebook was light on setting material because WEG/YÃ©ti Entertainment had planned a seperate setting book. That one was published in French, in an equal format as the main book (hardcover, full color interior, etc).The universe book contained (AFAIK) <i>no game stats</i>, as it doubled as a coffee table-like sourcebook for the fans of the graphic novels.<br><br>That said, I wasn't particularly fond of the Metabarons comic book, although I was a big fan of the other graphic novel series for which Jodorowski had created that iconic character: Les aventures de John Difool aka <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Incal" rel="nofollow">The Incal</a>.<br><br/><br/>But more on topic: I have to admit that I haven't detected any particular features in Jodorowky's works that make his way of telling a story remarkably different from other comic book authors.

An English translation of the Universe book was actually released as a PDF, and was available via RPGNow.  WEG added game stats for the English version, because their perception was (quite reasonably) that there would be very little market for the book to non-gamers.  That is, Metabarons and The Incal aren't that big outside of the French speaking world.<br/><br/>I think that it's no longer available due to some kind of copyright issues.  If the book had seen a print edition, there would be a few floating around in the distribution chain and they'd appear on Ebay every now and then.  Since it was only ever a PDF, there's no (legal) way to get it nowadays.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dirk Remmecke</cite>I have to admit that I haven't detected any particular features in Jodorowky's works that make his way of telling a story remarkably different from other comic book authors.</blockquote>
His storytelling (in the Metabarons series anyway) seems to be comprised of "drug-addled meandering extreme nonsense". If someone lined up 4 comics of any style, by any author, and said "one of these stories was written by Jodorowsky", I'd look for the most ridiculous, nonsensical, yet sensual one and that would be it. <br/><br/>A true game based on his works would go like this:<br/><br/>1) First, the GM would be called "The Jodorowsky". He would have unlimited fiat.<br/>2) Character generation would take about 20 seconds tops, because we wander from character to character so fast that anything more would get in the way of the story.<br/>3) Every player would have one stat, called "Importance".<br/>4) Every session would begin with the biggest group bang possible.<br/><br/>It would look like this:<br/><br/>The Jodorowsky: OK, so the Fengari Collective show up. Their ambassador says that they want to play Naked Explosion Space Chess for the fate of the universe. If they win, all the planets in human space will build engines to fly themselves into their suns. If they lose, they will give you a magic almond.<br/>Player One: Damn. So my guy is there, right?<br/>TJ: Yep.<br/>Player One: OK, I want to talk to them and try to nego...<br/>TJ: HOLD!  Player Two, what are you going to do?<br/>Player Two: Have sex with a space vampire pirate. While weeping bright yellow tears of pure energy.<br/>TJ: Good. Player Three?<br/>Player Three: I think that my robotic concubine is going to down a glass of Catholic infant blood, then try to seduce the ambass...<br/>TJ: HOLD!<br/>TJ: OK. All players, roll your Influence.<br/>P1: 15<br/>P2: 22<br/>P3: 8<br/>TJ: OK, here's what happens.<br/><i>then the The Jodorowsky proceeds to tell the players exactly what happens in the story, changing scenes, starting and resolving conflicts and combats, playing all the actions of the player characters, as he sees fit, until the story is over. This can take 20 minutes to three hours. Players are encouraged to sit back comfortably. Wine is offered.</i><br/>P1: Wow, that was fascinating!<br/>P2: I particularly enjoyed the role of my character in your story.<br/>P3: My character... didn't even appear. But still, I really enjoyed your story.<br/>TJ: It was nothing. OK, next story. Roll up new characters.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Yeah!  Something like that!  Except it would have to be Story Games-y.  With a mechanic for gibberish.<br/>

This gibberish mechanic might also generalize to the works of Grant Morrison, if it were somehow spliced with the pacing mechanics from PTA, so that every story ends in an avalanche of incomprehensible oddness.<br/>

                            While I think this game surely must be developped, if you were lazy I would suggest that the aesthetic of DRYH definitely could be twisted Jodorowski-style to create a properly ludicrous narrative. Just make sure that as a GM you spend all your tokens-whose-names-I-forget on making sure Madness dominates, and always set a minimum Madness of 2+ for every single conflict.<br/><br/>Also: automatic writing as mechanic? AWESOME. I think there's a lot of other excellent Surrealist 'exercises' that could be exploited to mechanical effect.                        </div>
