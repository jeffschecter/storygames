See through the eyes of an inhabitant of the Enshrouded Lands, a highly believable world of secret magic, hidden terrors and occult fantasy. Embark on a journey of exciting challenges, poignant themes, intrigue, mystery, suspense, discovery, fear, horror, tragedy and triumph. Explore how far you will go to stay true to yourself, and how far to answer your Soul's Calling. Out 2011.<br/>\n<br/>\nOK - this is the draft blurb. I would really appreciate feedback on what it conveys to you and whether the game sounds interesting. What kind of game do you think it is?<br/>\n<br/>\nHint:- this is, at least as far as I understand GNS, NOT a narrativist game in the strict GNS sense. The emphasis is on immersion [in a character's viewpoint of the unfolding events of the game] rather than story.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305308">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick" title="Troy_Costisick"><img alt="Troy_Costisick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://thumbs.webs.com/s/viewProfilePic/?siteId=67823825&amp;memberId=67823877&amp;size=small&amp;530737"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick">Troy_Costisick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305308/#Comment_305308" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-21T03:29:11+00:00" title="December 21, 2010  3:29AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heya Matt,<br/><br/>Congrats on bringing your game to market!

So I'll pose three questions to you that have been posed to me nearly every time I've published a new game:<br/><br/>1. What is your game about?<br/>2. What do the characters do?<br/>3. What do the players do?<br/><br/>I could guess, but I don't want to color your answers.<br/><br/>But all that aside, I'm really happy for you that you've gotten this far with your game.

What is my game about?<br/>\n<br/>\nA huge variety of things (which makes it hard to precis), but primarily - immersion in [a character's perspective of] a believable world where fantasy elements are strong but hidden. I suppose that what you might call the "narrative" focus is on the personal journey of each character, set within the cosmic struggle between the four major cosmic factions (each of which is split into sub-factions which may be in tension with each other too). Almost all beings (though they know it not) are tied in to that cosmic struggle in some way for all or almost all their lives. As part of this journey, characters' personalities (behavioural tendencies) and their souls' ties to the different cosmic factions will develop. Mechanics support social stats to make NPCs easier or harder to convince/persuade etc., but do not intrude abrasively into the immersive dialogue, which is almost entirely conducted using direct speech. Conflict often culminates in combat, and there is a huge variety of magic (even in the forthcoming core guide), but the game is not a game of hack-n-slash or spell-juggling. I would estimate 1 to 3 fights in a 4-hour session, taking up 30 mins to 90 mins of your playing time as a rule of thumb, but a large fight can be done and dusted in a few minutes if you use the impressionistic combat rules. The game is not about one single thing, but if it were, it would be immersion in [a character's perspective of] a believable world where fantasy elements are strong but hidden and the experience [through that character's perspective] of mystery, suspense, intrigue, discovery, excitement, dilemma, fear, horror, tragedy and triumph; secondary to that or colouring it would be the characters' part in a cosmic struggle, and their developing or wavering spiritual ties to the different cosmic factions. One of the difficulties I have with the question is that I don't see how "the enjoyment of mystery, suspense, discovery, intriuge, excitement, dilemma, fear, horror, tragedy and triumph through an in-character perspective" doesn't tell you what the game is about - because that IS what it is about. The game is not about the precise kind of narrative which unfolds. It is about the player's immersive experience of the game. Do you get me? I mean, it is a game about BEING a character in a particular kind of fantasy world, the ultra-believable kind, but with oodles of magic tucked away just out of view, and massives of dynamic conflict and other juicy stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. What do the characters do?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhatever they want, but their choices are made against the background of their behavioural tendencies and souls' ties. Mechanics incentivise dramatic choices consistent with behavioural tendencies and your favoured cosmic faction's ideals, and disincentivise choices inconsistent with that. But subject to that, the characters can go anywhere and do anything and everything. They may find themselves in wholly different kinds of situation from one session to the next.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is IMPORTANT about the characters is that they are a vehicle for the players to experience the ten things I have mentioned - excitement, dilemma, mystery, suspense, intrigue, discovery, fear, horror, tragedy and triumph - through an in-character perspective within the context of a believable world. Their precise "narrative" role is less important.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. What do the players do?<br/>\n<br/>\nPrimarily, roleplay immersively in the traditional fashion of trad RPGs - but NB to convey speech they MUST use direct speech (speak AS your character to speak FOR your character) - indirect speech is only for the ref (the same does not apply when describing the character's non-speech actions). There is a thin level of deliberate metagame:- as a player you can choose to adopt a party-constructive, conniving or mixed stance. Party-constructive means working together; conniving means making the game more interesting for other players by toying with them, but does NOT mean destroying their characters etc, and mixed is a mixture. This feeds into your advancement points awards in a small way (cf. xp). Playing up to your soul's ties could also be considered a thin meta-game level driving your character's actions in more dramatic directions. As a player, you do NOT get to edit the game-world. "Say yes, or roll dice" does NOT apply, although a positive and encouraging reffing attitude is recommended. As a player, you get to be surprised and baffled, and to experience excitement, dilemma, fear, horror, tragedy, triumph, mystery, suspense, intrigue and discovery through BEING your character in a believable but exciting world. <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that answer your question?<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305313">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305313/#Comment_305313" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-21T04:17:56+00:00" title="December 21, 2010  4:17AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            PS I've been editing the above like crazy, it's quite hard to get it right...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_305601">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305601/#Comment_305601" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-22T14:07:52+00:00" title="December 22, 2010  2:07PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, so, I'm starting my blurb over from scratch.

This will also explain the sentence "the ref reflects your alter-ego's persuasiveness and empathy in his roleplay" which is meant quite literally. The ref does not actually play your alter-ego (your character) at all - what he does is influence how NPCs come across, and how they react, according to the dice-rolls and/or stat-comparisons. It goes like this:-<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ref infers what the main tension in dialogue is likely to be (you could outright tell him what you're planning on achieving; it could be that it is the NPC who has the plan rather than the PC). He then calls for critical dice-rolls before dialogue gets underway. The outcome of those dice-rolls affects how he roleplays the NPCs - but it does NOT tell you the result of the dialogue. The result of the dialogue has to be worked out naturalistically, except that the ref biases himself in one direction or another according to the dice-roll. His roleplay reflects greater or lesser gullibility or cynicism, greater or lesser persuasiveness or dodginess. During dialogue if twists in the flow of dialogue take things in unanticipated directions, the ref does the same based on a simple stat comparison without dice-rolls to avoid interrupting the flow of dialogue. The ref keeps a single A4 sheet in front of him the lower half of which has the Persuasion and Empathic Observation scores for all PCs as well as some other key roleplay-related info.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe stat range is mainly 0 to 10 for player characters, but higher scores are possible - infinitely high in theory. Lower scores are reserved to NPCs for reasons of balance.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe key thing is that for every 2 points that your stat increases by, your effectiveness approximately doubles in some sense. Although that can never be a perfect rule.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Albi_SG" title="Albi_SG"><img alt="Albi_SG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Albi_SG">Albi_SG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305806/#Comment_305806" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-23T18:29:09+00:00" title="December 23, 2010  6:29PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I *do* like the way dies and stats are balanced: i've been inspired to go in that direction since i saw (but, admittedly, nbever played) the d10 edition of cyberpunk, and compared it to the d20 (which, at the time, was all i knew): i just had the impression that a range from 1 to 20 was leaving too much to luck. <br/><br/>the rules on ref action look a little bit too fluid, to me: unless there are some very well-defined limits, IMHO, one risks losing the equality and consistency of gm adjudicating, and, further, being biased by the way social relations around the table go. I'm well aware the outlook you gave here is just a superficial view of the whole business, though, so i imagine there is something more well-defined to it that ensures consistency...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_305845">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305845/#Comment_305845" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-24T06:29:02+00:00" title="December 24, 2010  6:29AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's not just about consistency - the overriding priority in the rules on dialogue is letting dialogue flow naturally from the player's (not GM's) perspective for the sake of the player's immersion in the character's point of view. Yes, one risks losing the equality and consistency of GM adjudication and being biased by the way social relations go around the table. But personally I think that you have to accept that limitation if you want to preserve maximal immersion. Besides, those things are not QUITE the problem they're often perceived as being, and to the extent that they are, you have to deal with that ANYWAY in EVERYTHING a GM does, unless he's bound by strict rules or conventions such as "say yes or roll the dice". Soul's Calling deliberately does not bind the GM in that way because it is in considerable part a game about facing the unknown.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe difference between d12 and d20 is far less important than the fact of having opposed rolls giving a probability curve instead of a straight line. Straight line probabilities create all sorts of distortions in the feel of the game, IMHO YMMV. After all, the difference between d10 and d20 can be eliminated just by halving or doubling stats...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
