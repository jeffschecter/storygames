It's an ideal magical land, where magic acts as science, and brings a golden age to the otherwise medieval and tribal setting. The main characters play, of course, Mages. The Mages live in The Greatest Place Ever City, where no-one is sick, fire requires only a word, food is plentiful, and new wonders are being built every day. Magic is possible because of these Pillars that surround the city, and move out further every year, and there is much speculation as to why or how, but most people don't mind because they make life awesome. Most. <br/><br/>I think you can see the possibilities for strife and politicking and DITV-esque themes that can arise from such a setting. YAY!<br/><br/><b>So, here's the question I pose to the forum part:</b><br/><br/>As it stands, we're starting the game as children, and getting into some antics. After a couple of sessions of that, we'll flash forward to the age our characters will be to function in the Magocracy as a group of Mages who are given power to go out and change the world. He's using the One Roll Engine (Wild Talents, Reign, Kerberos Club) as the system for the game. He wants our characters to develop in play as opposed to having fully created characters. That's part of the reasoning for starting off as children. The other thing he wants to do is only give us one stat. That stat will be based on the occupation of the character's parents. So, if you're parents were farmers, you would have the stat "I was raised a farmer" and you would get all the skills you could imagine would go along with that. "I've got a down to earth attitude" or "I get along well with animals" or "Handy with a choppin axe" are good examples of what this one "Farmer" stat could cover.<br/><br/>For some reason, though, this just didn't sit right with me. We're playing a game about magic, but the first defining trait our characters get is based on an occupation? Sounded just too DnD for me. Even sounded just too Spirit of the Century for me. Which led me to speculate, well, what else defines an RPG character other than it's occupation? Like, REALLY defines it, is one of the defining characteristics on the character sheet defines it?<br/><br/><b>The real question</b>:<br/><br/><span style="color: #FF0000;">What are some other things that RPG's use as a defining characteristic of a character besides "class" or "occupation"?</span><br/><br/>My first inclination is to look at something like Nobilis where your character is defined by a word, and that is what you have power over, in its entirety, and often defines some parts of your character's personality and appearance as well. But your occupation is still "Noble". I dunno, can you think of other examples? If there's no examples in existing games you could think of, what would you use as a defining characteristic for a character besides an occupation?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267823">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267823/#Comment_267823" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-19T11:29:07+00:00" title="April 19, 2010 11:29AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why not have each player choose the one defining trait themselves? One might take an occupation, another might choose a religion, a third one a relationship, a fourth one an emotional state... plenty of options, and if you're just going to use these as vague concepts that justify being allowed to roll dice, it doesn't seem to matter that much.<br/><br/>To put that in another way: if my concept is really about how my character is a fervent believer, then why would I have to put in "Occupation: Priest" to be allowed to mess about with religion-based skills? Why can't I just put "Religion: spagettimonsterism" instead?<br/><br/>By the way: will everybody have the same value for their one number? It'd be pretty interesting too see different values justified somehow, but then if everybody just has the same value, why call it a statistic instead of a character concept...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/marknau" title="marknau"><img alt="marknau" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c29/marknau/dwarf.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/marknau">marknau</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267824/#Comment_267824" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-19T11:31:35+00:00" title="April 19, 2010 11:31AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really dig the idea of lifepath character creation.

Or a nickname (given by adults or by the other children -- you could even do this collaboratively as players) that calls out something about them or their personality? A favourite toy or children's game?<br/><br/>To be honest I think the parents' occupation sounds really solid, for the 'child' portion of a game. It doesn't have the same boring associations as the character's own occupation or class. I mean, if your parents are farmers how about a skill/trait 'I hate the smell of manure' or 'I want to move to the city' -- there's lots of room for oppositional attitudes or surprising twists.<br/><br/>But I guess I like it because it feels contingent, instead of essential -- which is the opposite of what most people seem to look for in RPG characters, and certainly the opposite of astrology or a Nobilis-style system. Or Myers-Briggs for that matter. A child's parents' occupation is simply descriptive of the circumstance of their life, rather than a defining characteristic of Who They Are For All Time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267848">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267848/#Comment_267848" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-19T13:58:56+00:00" title="April 19, 2010  1:58PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I <em>think</em> some Japanese games use blood-type? <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/>  (Certain blood-types are associated with certain personality traits in some Japanese popular beliefs.)<br/><br/>To expand on Daniel's idea, how about a totum animal of some sort?

I'm going to propose all of them to the group, and see what people think.<br/><br/>Reading them over made me have a few more thoughts. I suppose I began to think about what shapes a starting character in a campaign after the games I've played recently. The most recent characters I've created for ongoing games being run in our group have been for Warhammer 2nd ed and Exalted. In both cases we've had elements that have tied the group together, beginning stories that then move into campaign stories, and then room for our characters to grow in the story. What I've found in both these cases, however, is that my character hasn't really grown. I was attributing some of this to the narrowness in character creation, and how a lot of thinking about the character when it first came about was based on random gen rolls and "career paths". I'm not sure framing the characters in that sense in the beginning was the best for helping me think about how that character would develop in the future. So a lot of my first inclination when hearing "choose your parent's occupation to describe your character" seemed like it was going down that path as well.<br/><br/>I do like what people have had to say in this thread about the "parents occupation" trait, however. It does seem open and flexible enough to change once the characters become adults, and has enough embedded themes surrounding it to pick and choose which ones you want to emphasize. I suppose maybe some of these other suggestions could be used as "support" in thinking about which parts of that trait you want to emphasize, and which parts you want to let go, as a person building this character. This game, to me, seemed the perfect opportunity to delve into something a bit deeper and more personal than the obvious implications behind an occupation. That's where things in this thread that stand out to me like the Plato personality types, and the pairing of two elements seem more along the lines of themes of magic and introspection.<br/><br/>Roger, what did you mean by this?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Roger</cite><br/>Something like "parent's occupation" has some interesting qualities:<br/>- the character has no control over it<br/>- the character is unlikely to change it<br/>- it may or may not have a significant impact on the present day<br/><br/>I think any prospective replacement should be considered in light of those qualities, among others.</blockquote>\nAlso, Daniel: Your occupation will be come "mage" once you are no longer a child in the game. So I think that's purposeful, and shouldn't be included as a beginning trait. <br/><br/>Also, your parent's occupation may or may not remain on your character sheet after the into stories! I know, I know, I'm probably thinking about this too much.

Like, when I play D&amp;D, my character becomes more powerful, but nothing about him really changes.  The strictures of the game are such that having a change of heart about adventuring isn\u2019t what\u2019s supposed to come out of play.<br/><br/>The idea of using parents\u2019 occupation seems vague.  It\u2019s something interesting to consider when the character is a kid, but my farmhand could just as easily be looking to become a mage to escape a life of labor, because he\u2019s lazy or hates toiling with his hands or whatever, as he could be someone who\u2019s humble or hardworking.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: anansigirl</cite>Your occupation will be come "mage" once you are no longer a child in the game.

As in, \u201cThis campaign is about adolescent outsiders becoming part of a magic-wielding ruling class.\u201d  What would you need to know about the character to play that game?  How about using Dread-style questionnaires to get at some of this information?  Questions such as \u201cWhat was your parents\u2019 occupation,\u201d \u201cWhat brought you to the city,\u201d and \u201cWhy do you want to become a mage\u201d seem like they would accomplish getting at the heart of each character while not having to be tied to numerical ratings.  Then you all could overlay some kind of resolution mechanic on top.<br/><br/>I hope that\u2019s helpful or at least thought-provoking.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267923">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267923/#Comment_267923" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-20T10:14:04+00:00" title="April 20, 2010 10:14AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: anansigirl</cite>I suppose maybe some of these other suggestions could be used as "support" in thinking about which parts of that trait you want to emphasize, and which parts you want to let go, as a person building this character.</blockquote>\nPresumably the actual gameplay will be the main tool for this too, right? I mean isn't that part of what growing up means -- figuring out what parts of the life your parents have provided you want to abandon, which parts you want to use, how you are going to transform yourself? So I mean if your character applies one derived trait and it results in a catastrophic failure, they might reconsider just how valuable that aspect of what it means to be 'a farmer's child' really is.<br/><br/>I guess what I would suggest is that, to me, there is no concern about this stat defining the character at all -- other than mechanically, I guess, in this first set of sessions -- when you already know they are going to grow up to be a completely different occupation (a mage.) You already know they aren't going to follow in their parents footsteps, occupation-wise, so it's precisely a question of 'how much of this background, if any, will my character carry forward, and how?'                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267930/#Comment_267930" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-20T10:55:17+00:00" title="April 20, 2010 10:55AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 20, 2010 10:57AM by Potemkin.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: anansigirl</cite>As it stands, we're starting the game as children, and getting into some antics.</blockquote>\nPerhaps for the first <i>epoch</i> of play, characters should be defined by more childhood/institutional relationships and attitudes?<br/><br/>Where do you sit in class?<br/><i>"At the front, of course!"/"At the front, teacher likes to keep an eye on me."/"Next to Kitty."/"I like my seat near the window."/"At the back, where else?"</i><br/>When do you do your homework?<br/><i>"At home, at five o'clock each day."/"In remedials."/"At my friend's.

That version was <em>terrible</em> in many respects, but I think it could still be an awesome idea for some other game. As Matt suggested, the Kiersey names give you some nice, evocative titles. If you do this, make sure you do something with each of those four axes (introversion vs. extroversion; sensing vs. intuition; thinking vs. feeling; judgment vs. perception).<br/><br/>The latest version of my game uses three things to define characters: your age, your talent (which gets about as close to "your job" as a society without specialization gets), and the place where you feel most at home. My game focuses on tribal peoples, so those aspects might help highlight the tribal parts of your setting.<br/><br/>Of course, we have occupation and classes so widely in gaming precisely because that really does reflect what medieval Europe cared about when pigeon-holing people, so I don't know how much I'd worry about it for the more medieval Europe parts of your setting.
