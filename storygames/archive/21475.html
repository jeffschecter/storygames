Their original community is a collection of starships on their way to colonize an area and their subsequent decisions where based on the narrative that they were discovering a planetary systems, asteroids, rival species, etc.<br/>It inspired me to try a similar tactic, but instead i'll be using an underwater setting.  I wondered, has anyone else out there tried some unique settings and what kinds of decisions did you have to change in order to fit that setting?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin" title="Colin"><img alt="Colin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin">Colin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469950/#Comment_469950" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-12T16:47:36+00:00" title="February 12, 2018  4:47PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The main thing might be to fix a sense of scale, but that often happens organically. Just water shouldn't be an issue, though.  <br/><br/>I've done games where everyone lives on a single small island, to wide sweeping landscapes, and didn't really encounter any issues.<br/><br/>Let us know how it goes?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
