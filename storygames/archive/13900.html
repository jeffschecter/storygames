Work with me here, please, and lets try to attack the <i>theme</i> with a new twist ... (and leave any personal soreness out of it)<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hexabolic</cite>I shed a few tears at a Werewolf game, of all things.  Some powerful drama worked out between a dying elder of the sept and the truculent warder.  Excellent stuff, not at all what I expected from that game.</blockquote>The sad thing about Werewolf and Vampire, is that these games have a theme that may blow your brains out, but instead the games work to dull most of their players.<br/><br/>I know there are thousands of players out there, who have made their World of Darkness a vivid thing. Those of them reading this will have to forgive me for being so unfair when ignoring their ability to make these games right. Forgive my unfair (and partly unfounded) generalization, please. Let it ride, for the sake of discussion. <br/><br/>I am sad for the many storytellers and player-groups who have failed to make these games into the jewels they should be, and sad for my own experience with them. I came to these games as an adult and experienced player, but with great expectations all the same, and found nothing but odd leadership and strangely placid players. So these games failed to deliver me, and had made my more WoD-experienced co-players into something I barely recognized as interactive participants in a game.<br/><br/>- From the way these games present themselves, I would expect playing them to bring you, the player, to the brink of tears. I would expect them to engage most players profoundly, and to produce meaningful drama of high quality. <br/><br/>- From the way these games are played, however, I do not expect them to bring me anywhere. I can see how players fall for the cool content, and how many of them fail to see that the coolness of it is hollow, as the method leaves the storyteller impotent, and fails to place the players in the eye of the storm.<br/><br/>I love these legends still, and would like to have a discussion on how to make the legends right in role-playing games. I will do this is two separate threads, one on the vampire and one on the werewolf, if there are enough interest for it on the forum. So here's my agenda for this thread:<br/><br/><b>- How do you design for interesting vampire-play?</b> <br/>- How do you support the players in the conflicts of the vampire? <br/>- Do you have an example of this done right (game or session), and thoughts on why?<br/><br/>- How do you make <i>potent</i> player-character vampires? <br/>I'm talking <i>potent</i> as in playable, captivating, emotionally challenging and thought-provoking ...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_314867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314867/#Comment_314867" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-01T00:04:51+00:00" title="March  1, 2011 12:04AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have more to say about this subject when it comes to Werewolf, no Vampire.<br/><br/>Vampire has been a fun game for me, but never really dramatic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_314869">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314869/#Comment_314869" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-01T00:35:53+00:00" title="March  1, 2011 12:35AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess the question is how do you get the player to care about the things the vampire cares about?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_314870">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314870/#Comment_314870" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-01T00:39:25+00:00" title="March  1, 2011 12:39AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think a big part of the horror in VtM, which, I think is a potent thing to experience as a player through the vehicle of your character, is the sheer hopelessness of your condition. Its weird, but a good Vampire game, using the World of Darkness is more Manchurian Candidate than The Hunger. I think the reason for this is that the Vampire experience becomes more diluted more and more each time you play, each time you familiarize yourself with what your about to experience. Horror, like humor, works best when you can keep your audience (even if your audience is yourself) off guard.<br/><br/>How do you design for interesting vampire-play?<br/><br/>You make the nature of vampirism and the PC's relationship to vampirism a mystery up front. Establish a world with a feeling or safety, consistency and meaning and then introduce the vampire, or vampirism as the cancerous other that they are. This works with whatever version of vampires your going for. The sex that vampires represent should poisonous self destructive sex, so should the power and the violence that they bring. Never make them pretty, never make them nice but always make them dangerous and irresistible.<br/><br/>How do you support the players in the conflict of the vampire?<br/><br/>Give them room to breath and think about the consequences of their characters actions. When they are the most comfortable, speed things up, push things along, force hands, rock boats, when they are the least comfortable, let it sit. Let the monstrosity and the otherness sink in. Talk about uncomfortable things before and after actual play. Get them to the edge of the creepy pool and urge them to dive in.<br/><br/>Do you have an example of this done right?<br/><br/>Yes, over and over again. The first time I introduced some of my high school friends to role playing we a version of vampire that turned out to be an extended prelude. The only common and predefined elements that we agreed on were that all of the PC's were cops and that at some point, some time in the future, they would become vampires. It moved between slow establishing action to punctuated violence and a gradual building of the realization that these creatures, these very evil, unsettling creatures, had their cold dead fingers in every single pie in sight. How do you react as a cop when you realize that your on the payroll of a monster and that the slightest resistance on your part means not death, but worse than death, blood addiction, cannibalistic, the murder of your family and loved ones.<br/><br/>It played out like an edgy cop drama mixed with taught psychological thriller and we never once stuck our tongues in out cheeks or stopped long enough to let the vampire become ridiculous or predictable or cliche, and that, is why I think it worked.<br/><br/>The problem with VtM, I think, for a lot of people (forgiving for the moment its difficulties with probabilities, consistent presentation, etc...) is that a lot of people looked at the Gothic punk world and laughed at it. They might have liked and even thought it was cool but they brought with them a level of self awareness that turns the monstrous other into just another Halloween costume or dated movie reference.<br/><br/>How do you make potent player-character vampires?<br/>Find that space between hollow and passionate. Take something about yourself, some way that you can be cruel, some way that you can be "inhuman" and exaggerate it or twist it until it becomes truly monstrous. Be willing to play the living dead, the hopeless and to cling on for dear life to anything that might keep you alive a little longer. Read Wraith: the Oblivion which did so many things right that Vampire should have done from the beginning. Never laugh at yourself, never take anything for granted about what being a vampire means. I mean, sit down for half an hour and try, just try, to imagine what it would be like to murder someone for their blood. The blood that you'll drink like a starving man eats food while their corpse grows cold beside you.<br/><br/>In other words, if you want a game that does vampires and not the romance of vampires (which to me are two very different beasts) you have to take how horrible these things would be if they were real seriously.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_314871">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Silerias" title="Silerias"><img alt="Silerias" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v353/Silerias/IconVAL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Silerias">Silerias</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314871/#Comment_314871" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-01T02:05:56+00:00" title="March  1, 2011  2:05AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A couple of years ago, I masterized a vampire game. My friends and I were fond of WoD rpg and it took great excitement for me to design my own "realistic" World of Darkness in old Europe. the characters that were created were young and were, by no means, aware of the net of sharks waiting to eat them. By Prince's decision (a Brujah one), they were thrown in the territory of an elder Malkavian who seemed not to care about the fledging cainites.<br/>\nThe territory was overcrowded with them and masquerade breach was a permanent threat. Furthermore, the sire of one of the PC warned his child that this territory was also used by nomadistic cainites: caitiff, non Camarilla clans and of course Sabbath scouts. You, young ones should manage the territory together as a coterie if you wanna survive your first years as vampires were his words.<br/>\nOur young vampires were outcasts from vampire society (a "contre pied" since they were from very social clans: toreadors and Ventrue). No one of them known where to find Elyseum meetings and most of our games were day to day survival. Mood was: lack of life, lack of food, lack of leisure... Every relashionship was precious indeed. Every met human was also precious.<br/>\nVampire events were, most of the time, off screen. When it came on screen, it was generally a great excitement for the players and some changing events for the characters.<br/>\nHere's one such on screen event:<br/>\nThere is a tradition in the Ventrue clan named "Agoge" a kind of "coming to adulthood". during agoge, every member of Ventrue clan must teach something to his fledging brother/sister before considering him adult and worthy of competiting with. One of the Elder , a real badass named Burchard de Saint Amand was the left hand of the former dead Ventrue prince and a rival to the Ventrue PC's sire. The lesson he teached to the PC was, of course, a tainted one. How to sustain? Look and learn!<br/>\nBurchard sent a meeting to the PC where he was invited at a "bal masqu\xe9" in a manor. I owned a booked of Venitian Canival pictures with very good examples of costumes design and ask the player to choose the one he was renting. Maybe, it could be a solo adventure but I wanted to create some kind of tension between the PCs and designed a "Eyes wide shut" style adventure for a second PC (a toreador one) who was investigating the death of a female human. Our "tom Cruise" was the witness of the Ventrue Agoge. Like in eyes wide shut, every one was masked and I easily illustrated every NPC with my Venitian's Carnival book. The Ventrue and the Toreador didn't know each other's disguise and that was very fun to play, to. Then, as the orgy was running, came the time for Burchard to teach his lesson. I really prepared the ritual... Every move, Every act... Step by step, the ventrue PC was attracted in the center of a dance macabre where laid a female sacrifice. Step by step, Burchard attracted the PC into his web. The pinacle of the scene was when he gived the sacrificial knife to the PC and when this one recognized one of his calice as the woman he ought to kill. Of course, the PC refused to kill the precious woman (precious in many ways) and Burchard looked deeply in the PC's eyes to dominate him and obliged him to do it and kill.<br/>\nThat was a really dramatic scene! The player knowed that his friend was looking at the scene and he was obliged to take this life in spite of all the vampire's powers of his PC and all his good will and morality.<br/>\nA really strong link was forged between Burchard and the PC. Never will the the PC forgot the rape he had lived!

They give you a mechanical bonus, they nurture you, help you, protect you. They keep you warm from the cold that creeps from the inside of your heart.<br>The more you act heinously, the more you put your relationships at risk, the more grasp the beast has on you. <br>The beast's grasp might translate into compulsive scenes. The GM (if any) may call a scene, tell the scene's theme like in "how you kidnap and slaughter an innocent" and then it is up to the player controlling the vampire to frame such scene.<br>Such scenes should harm relationships first.<br><br>Maybe losing relationships earns you darkness tokens that can be spent by others to call in complusory scenes. or something like that.<br/><br/>Some solid buy in is going to be needed, mind you. Kinda inevitable.<br/><br/>But avoiding giving the characters powers that are only useful to fight would surely ensure that players turn the game into a hack and slash.<br/><br/>To be honest, I'd do completely without any mechanics concerning such "vampire powers" because they can perfectly work as mere color. They're hardly the point about being a vampire: the point is "struggling with the beast within which threatens to eat away what remains of your humanity".<br/><br/>And this is a possible approach, the one closer to what the premise of WoD Vampire was supposed to have.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_314891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314891/#Comment_314891" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-01T06:38:48+00:00" title="March  1, 2011  6:38AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: masqueradeball</cite>I think the reason for this is that the Vampire experience becomes more diluted more and more each time you play, each time you familiarize yourself with what your about to experience.</blockquote>Working with changing focus in rpgs is interesting.

Just read some Anne Rice, you'll see what they were after, instead of this. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>Great suggestions from everyone, I would return to the books and point out something that I didn't grasp how great it was at the time, which is Themes and Tones. These are very simple organizing principles around which you build your campaign. Think them up and stick with them as far as you can. If your theme is Disappointment, be sure that every NPC is disappointed in something or has disappointed someone or has expectations for something that will never happen, and so on. Soon the players will be telling their servants, "You have failed me again." and sighing heavily. They'll get it.<br/><br/>Another thing is to emphasize consequences (and determine them using the Theme and Tone). And not just bad, tragic consequences either. If you are constantly hammering them with how awful it all is, they will feel it is pointless to do anything, and they will do nothing. Put them in an unwinnable trap like the WoD's Camarilla and they will battle like devious animals <i>to achieve something virtuous</i>.  (This is why the Humanity system as written is good.) If doing good is impossible, or seems so, your game will go nowhere, not because they won't choose to be monsters, but because if that's the only option, it's not really a choice. So yes, come up with some tragic consequences for them getting involved in (by choice or not) situations, but also think about making amends. It's a long eternity, someone will come up with something decent to do at some point just by chance!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: masqueradeball</cite>The problem with VtM, I think, for a lot of people (forgiving for the moment its difficulties with probabilities, consistent presentation, etc...) is that a lot of people looked at the Gothic punk world and laughed at it.</blockquote>\nThis is not a problem, plenty of people laugh at horror in all forms, it's how they cope with it.

The slight difference between the Shadowguide (the corruptor in Wraith) and the Beast as depicted in Vampire is that the Beast is explicitly not really functional, it is just a bundle of anger, fear (of sunlight and God and fire), and hunger (for blood).  It is put in stark contrast to the capacity for reason and other sorts of passion. This is why WoD vampires lose themselves in lust, but find it gets tangled with sadism (anger) and blood cults (hunger).  So the Beast doesn't really have a plan, it is not an antagonist as much as it is the boundless sea that will drown you when your raft pulls apart.

Shortly thereafter I moved to a 'freeform' game, where I was just picking issues that I knew were provocative and personal.  It was emotionally sophomoric and simple but it did provoke an incredibly engaging game.  The wish fulfillment was juxtaposed against personal consequences, and the tension between was was desirable and what was unacceptable between the players was very fruitful.<br/><br/>I used completely typical techniques, most of them recommended by the VtM book.  After a few sessions I had a very large number of players, and would take them aside individually or in groups, assign them characters and ask how they felt about the issues being raised by the actions surrounding the 'protagonists'.  Then I would connect them to the issues and other characters in play, and sort of just lob situations and referee, and from time to time cut to expository scenes.  It ended up being slightly LARP-ish (unfortunately I didn't know what that was at the time), and theatrical.  It also facilitated high engagement, even as the audience.<br/><br/>I am sad to say that the rules, like Strength and Humanity and Fortitude and Brujah and dice pools, were only an initial point of reference and in the first few sessions when I was still using them were a real drag; however, a lot of the suggestions for approaching play were at least inspirational and often useful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_314903">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Silerias" title="Silerias"><img alt="Silerias" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v353/Silerias/IconVAL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Silerias">Silerias</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314903/#Comment_314903" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-01T07:46:34+00:00" title="March  1, 2011  7:46AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In fact, I had <b>a lot of work</b> to achieve that very climax.

Heavy mechanics in general are a drag, as they tend to come in the way of efficient dialogue-techniques. There's little horror, and little of other moods too, to be had with halting dialogue-technique. <br><br>To support themes dependent on shared moods, like horror and romantics, you need a game-method with good balance between conflict-mechanics and dialogue-techniques, and to have that you need fast and dynamic mechanics. Mechanics of old, like those in Vampire, are too heavy to function well in such games. They are as flexible as a tank in a dense forest; you will get through it, but the forest is wasted. The faster mechanics makes it easier to vary the pace of the game-lay, and to shift focus between active and reflective scenes. And you get to follow up on <i>inspired dialogue</i> in a much more efficient way. Such flexibility is of great importance, in classical role-playing games (the ones with the GM/player-divide), when dealing with moods and deeper character-play.<br><br>And if the game is lacking in this department, you are most often better off leaving the mechanics altogether, and go free-form.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_314910">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Silerias" title="Silerias"><img alt="Silerias" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v353/Silerias/IconVAL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Silerias">Silerias</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314910/#Comment_314910" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-01T08:18:08+00:00" title="March  1, 2011  8:18AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 1, 2011 8:18AM by Silerias.">edited March 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite><br>And if the game is lacking in this department, you are most often better off leaving the mechanics altogether, and go free-form.</br></blockquote>\nOr use another game's mechanics.

I think you need to be able to either embrace or adequately replace that mystique to make Vampire work. That thing you said about Anne Rice early also blends very well with this.

Is<i>Smallville</i>one of them?</blockquote>\nNot really. Smallville intentionally makes character capability quite vague.  How much stronger Superman is than a normal guy is connected to how significant the relationship is that Superman is trying to protect, preserve or change when he tries to hold back that locomotive.  Smallville is really good, but it does not create the feeling of an objective reality, it sacrifices solidity for drama.  Being able to look at your sheet and say "I can lift 100 tons" is an important measure for establishing that reality.  Smallville doesn't and can't really provide that.<br><br>However, if you wanted to use Smallville for supernatural drama, there are other things about it, as I say, that very strongly recommend it.  For example, the use of a Heritage Asset allows characters to have easier access to a set of supernormal abilities, and can be used to represent others that have access to that same Heritage. For example, I could easily see a "Camarilla Heritage" Asset created to represent the Camarilla bloodlines/vampiric upbringing that could be used against the character by Sabbat jerkoffs and Inquisition guys who find their best friend's cellphone bills.  Also, the importance of relationships would feed into the kind of approach that Suna suggested.<br><br>All I'm saying is you give something up when you move away from simulation-type mechanics of the sort the WoD games used.

There are classical games which do the simulation-type mechanics better.<br/><br/>My own classical role-playing game <i>Fabula</i> delivers the crunch very well, while being fast and flexible enough to make room for a great variety of dialogue-techniques. <i>Fabula</i> doing this is not due to me being overly clever, but a lucky coincidence. I had the luck of designing my game for use with children, in short sessions, and so <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I had to</span> make a fast and simple game. I made playing with children into a payed daytime job back in 1995, and developed <i>Fabula</i> to cater for the needs in that job. For each year in that job, I developed the game further, writing and rewriting, and testing all elements of the game to the breaking point, again and again. It was published in 1999, in it's 8th edition. And I continued to use it in my job, and to develop it further ( I still do). As I developed the mechanics of <i>Fabula</i>, over the years, with simplicity as the leading idea, it enabled me to go deeper into the uncharted realms of dialogue-techniques, experimenting and experiencing how they may be used to strengthen the game, by design. <br/><br/>My experience is that you need to have a game that is solid enough, and flexible enough, to let the conflict-mechanics match the stride of an inspired dialogue. And when it does, the mechanics are able to feed the dialogue with the right amount of crunch, to keep it flowing towards new heights.<br/><br/>So I believe that you may very well choose games with faster and more flexible mechanics, and still get the crunch. <i>Fabula</i> is not available for all, being in Norwegian, but it is fairly conventional in design, so the same qualities are possible in English games too.<br/><br/>That aside:<br/>I like the things you say about the "Heritage Asset" and relationships in <i>Smallville</i>. Makes me think it may be worth checking out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_314980">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314980/#Comment_314980" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-01T14:55:21+00:00" title="March  1, 2011  2:55PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: stefoid</cite><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite><cite>Posted By: stefoid</cite>I guess the question is how do you get the player to care about the things the vampire cares about?</blockquote>Ok!

Amber would be an excellent choice for an approach like that, especially the bidding system (which creates a PvP, dog-eat-dog, worse-than-zero-sum atmosphere before the characters are even created) and the complete inaccessibility of the game mechanics.

Also, you gain an automatic success if you spend a point of Willpower. What this means is that you don't need to roll if what your doing is beneath you or if you really care about the outcome (though normally, you'd roll anyway I guess, to try and get even more successes).<br/>\nAlso, the "spotting" required to see successes in a pool is less difficult for some people than the addition required in other systems. I've rarely seen skilled WW players freeze when asked how many successes, but in countless D20 games I've seen people (who aren't stupid or mathematically challenged in general) blank on what 13 +25 is.<br/>\nAlso, people love rolling dice. I don't so much, not huge pools of them anyway, but I take it from Exalted and Warhammer fans that rolling obscene amounts of dice is a fun activity that, like JD said, really drives home the "oomph" behind the action.<br/>\nIts always been my take that the mechanics in Vampire are written in such a way that you're supposed to want to avoid using them until, well, until you don't. Combat was slow and technical in the og version of Vampire (either 1e with its maneuvers or 2e with the whole count backwards initiative thing) and it was a thing I saw players purposefully avoid getting into until it was that fight, the one where you really wanted to do a blow by blow detail breakdown, or where it really mattered just hard Sebastian hit Sybilla. It sort of like the earlier editions of Mind's Eye Theatre, where you got XP for never evoking your Traits. The game subtly rewards you for avoiding the mechanics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_314987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314987/#Comment_314987" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-01T15:27:54+00:00" title="March  1, 2011  3:27PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As to the questions from Thomas' above post:<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you tilt the focus?<br/>\n<br/>\nChange the mythology constantly, especially be willing to BBQ sacred cows, but make these changes from a place of trust. Make sure your players trust you as much or more than they trust the game text.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do designers cater to exploring the bad sides of our own natures?<br/>\n<br/>\nMake it clear that thats what the games about. In step one of character creation write:<br/>\n<br/>\n"Think of something you don't like about yourself, or something that you really do. Not a physical quality, but an emotional, moral or psychological one. Now, make a character about that thing, a character that you like who shares that thing you hate about yourself, or one you sympathize with who totally lacks that trait you value so much in yourself."<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayers who step up to that challenge will be embracing the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, what I said about taking vampires seriously wasn't necessarily the same thing as taking the fiction seriously. I think, for instance, that the majority of the Cthulu stuff fails to take Cthulu very seriously, and thats what so appealing about it. People like vampires because their sexy and it'd be cool to have teeth and always be young. Thats not wrong, but its not a serious reflection on what vampirism, in any of its form, would really be like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_314988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314988/#Comment_314988" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-01T15:30:57+00:00" title="March  1, 2011  3:30PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 1, 2011 3:33PM by JDCorley.">edited March 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>There are classical games which do the simulation-type mechanics better.</blockquote>\nSure, no game, and nothing at all on this fallen earth is perfect, but to say that the existing WoD Vampire system has no strengths is empirically disproven by its enormous success.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_314989">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314989/#Comment_314989" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-01T15:34:39+00:00" title="March  1, 2011  3:34PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite><cite>Posted By: stefoid</cite><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite><cite>Posted By: stefoid</cite>I guess the question is how do you get the player to care about the things the vampire cares about?</blockquote>Ok!

It's seems I've played White Wolf game so much that I'm now sick of it. <br/>Nevertheless, back to the years I was fond of the whole White Wolf stuff, the chronicles I've played took many colors. Yes, superhuman with fangs was one of them but as far as I remember, the political fucking bastard chronicle was a favorite one (and it sucked as well). <br/><br/>My point of view is that if y'ou're seeking a more horror style chronicle: then do it. Make every NPC human. Limit the discipline powers in the hands of your PC. Limit interactions between the coterie and the rest of the world of dakness (no Elysium for the PCs was a really good choice of mine). Name and give deepness to every contact, ally, chalice, follower... Limit the scale of your play (not the whole city, a single quarter is sufficient). Involve PCs in mundane affairs. Take your time. <br/><br/>Yes, rules matters and VtM ones are not the best to achieve the horror style of play but with some work it's always possible to be touched by this kind of game. Let's return to the basics, the prelude...

Thanks for the recommendation! Never heard of the movie <i>Martin</i>. Will check out!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: masqueradeball</cite>I don't know that Tomas is saying that dice rolling is bad</blockquote>Certainly not! Players come in all varieties. I'm not against die-rolling, and I do believe people like <i>doing things</i>. That is fine with me.<br/><br/>I'm proposing for us to analyze <i>vampires</i> as a theme for role-playing design, and to ponder how it may be done good/better/superb. Trying to evoke the dark powers of this theme, I expect a method with more power in the dialogue-techniques, to be better suited. And that idea place certain demands on any conflict-mechanics we discuss here.<br/><br/>Mind you; my assumption is that any <b>method</b> in a role-playing game consist of <b>dialogue-techniques</b> and <b>conflict-mechanics</b>. I'm used to work with the methodic <i>balance</i> between techniques and mechanics in my rpg design. But I know that this is a rare way of thinking. Most designers, and indeed most players, is new to the thought of designing in the field of dialogue-techniques. They are used to thinking of light and heavy systems. The dialogue-techniques are most often referred to as "play style", or inferred in the term "narrative", and this nomenclature creates a certain "box of thinking". We do not have to go deeper into these semantics. Let it be as it is, and let's try to go outside that box in this thread.<br/><br/>BTW: I believe we needs to be careful now, not to forget about the <i>vampires</i> here!

You can gain something, sure, but you also give something up.</blockquote>Sure, you give something up. But you can gain a lot.<br/><br/>In Smallville, you can reframe powers as story-based meta-abilities. Like the fact that you have super senses and super speed gives you the ability to jump in to a scene that you weren't in at the beginning. I think that has more story-meaning than "the dice prove that I can run as fast as a horse".<br/><br/>And do you really need the dice to tell you that you're stronger than a human? Being stronger than a human is ultimately just flavor for how you narrate the conflict resolution anyway.<br/><br/>If the game is really about values and relationships, then putting those at the center of play instead of stats and powers is a great way to help the game refocus on the stories and the secrets.<br/><br/>Smallville's mechanics are specifically designed to let you fail without giving up your secrets. I think that's an important mechanic for vampire drama.<br/><br/>Also, Smallville is better than most games at making it so that characters of varying "power levels" play together effectively. Plus, it's better than most games at having antagonists in the play group. Which is great. You could do various Vamp+Mortal combinations much more effectively than most systems would support.<br/><br/>The biggest tweak that I can think that would help support the theme would be to make it so you could challenge and decrease virtues the same way you do to relationships. So some of your virtues could decay as you explore the vampire darkness.

One had a ward that they had raised from an infant in secret.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn't put a limit on what kind of vamp they could be, or how old they could be.  One was several hundred years old, another one was only a few years old.  They were loose allies but not a 'party' per se.  I connected several of them through NPC's.  And I allowed those that wanted to to occupy significant offices in the city heirarchy.  One of the characters was the Prince's Hound (or Templar as it was a Sanctified city.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI stipulated that vampires embraced mostly when they either thought they were in love, and wanted to continue the relationship by making their companion immortal.  Or that a certain set of skills was so valuable that they absolutely must have that person survive indefinately.  Otherwise they made ghouls.  This led to this great web of connected vampires who were all essentially ex-lovers...and everyone knows how good those relationships are.<br/>\n<br/>\nI played the beast like a possessor demon in Sorcerer.  (we agreed to this beforehand.)  If you lost control, it got to do things that were horrible (and I as GM actually played the beast.)  We thought this made going into frenzy much scarier, because they weren't in control if it happened.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an alternate system, I always wanted to try Jared's Monster Garage varient from the Chroniclers guidebook.  The vices actually become your stats.  I thought it was a pretty cool idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom a <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/12/12498.phtml" rel="nofollow">review on rpg net:</a><br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Monster Garage makes larger changes to the core system than any other variant. The idea here is to really play up the monstrous aspect of Kindred, and to do that Vices are used constantly. First, all Attributes are discarded and replaced with Power, Finesse, and Resistance. Second, all Abilities are discarded and replaced with the Vices from World of Darkness. So a roll to sweet talk a prostitute might be Finesse + Lust in the new, simpler system. Disciplines are also made simple, and in general the World of Darkness system becomes very light on rules. The tweaks are meant to encourage immersive, horrific roleplay where the characters are firmly established as horrible creatures. An example Chronicle, Little Tyrants, puts this setup to work.</div>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_315227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315227/#Comment_315227" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-02T23:05:10+00:00" title="March  2, 2011 11:05PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 2, 2011 11:08PM by TomasHVM.">edited March 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RobMcDiarmid</cite>Smallville's mechanics are specifically designed to let you fail without giving up your secrets.

You could do various Vamp+Mortal combinations much more effectively than most systems would support.<br/><br/>The biggest tweak that I can think that would help support the theme would be to make it so you could challenge and decrease virtues the same way you do to relationships.

Vampires in movies are usually given such heavy treatment: special effects, lighting, dramatic music, that they're shown as unbearably cool.  I think this attracts a kind of wish fulfillment.  The clans, which present such strong archetypal characters, complete with thumbnail personality (the nutty Malkavian) play to this.  Just writing down your clan and you've effortlessly evoked (or so it seems) a strong character concept.<br/><br/>Strip away the direction, cinematography and music, however, and all you're left with is interaction, where the last thing you want is players lost in reverie about their cool (unaffected, diffident) characters.<br/><br/>Separately, I think advancement mechanics are antithetical to the themes I whiff from the vampire fiction that comes to mind, which are tragic tales of dependency and isolation.  Approaching these with D&amp;D-like advancement unwittingly injects a post-war optimism, "Work hard and you'll move up, son!"  Dracula, Let the Right One In - the characters are all best off at the beginning.

When I read it, Dracula seemed like a symbol of pure monstrosity, otherness, alienness. I took the romance and the sex between the human characters to be the addition of melodrama to what was essentially a pure horror story. I actually hated the Copolla Dracula for playing up the sex of a Dracula that was described as being very plainly hideous, but I digress...<br/><br/>To me vampires are all about boredom and the dangers of complacency. They're immortal, powerful, and completely useless to the society on which they thrive. They're such a good analogy for alienation and ennui and the existential dilemma. The vampire is the super-youth, the lost boy.<br/><i>edited for garmmars</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html

John Darling the protective brother who wants to see Peter as a friend (because he misses his dead brother Micheal so much) but worries about his sister's failing health.

I checked the character list, and they didn't seem to be using the same names. I didn't take the time to read a synopsis.<br/><br/>Edit: Just read through the story. There's no real Peter Pan there at all. Tenuous at best. I'm suggesting more of the "twisted fairy tale" approach, where you take a familiar story line and characters and play with it a bit. Much more direct of a parallel, at least in the initial setup. Then let it twist away a bit because of the changes you've made.<br/><br/>I'll have to throw the idea at my buddies.

Vampires in movies are usually given such heavy treatment: special effects, lighting, dramatic music, that they're shown as unbearably cool.  I think this attracts a kind of wish fulfillment.  The clans, which present such strong archetypal characters, complete with thumbnail personality (the nutty Malkavian) play to this.  Just writing down your clan and you've effortlessly evoked (or so it seems) a strong character concept.<br/><br/>Strip away the direction, cinematography and music, however, and all you're left with is interaction, where the last thing you want is players lost in reverie about their cool (unaffected, diffident) characters.<br/><br/>Separately, I think advancement mechanics are antithetical to the themes I whiff from the vampire fiction that comes to mind, which are tragic tales of dependency and isolation.  Approaching these with D&amp;D-like advancement unwittingly injects a post-war optimism, "Work hard and you'll move up, son!"  Dracula, Let the Right One In - the characters are all best off at the beginning.  "We cheated death, and it wasn't worth it."</blockquote>This post of yours, Michael, is the best damned post of all! Full of insight and direction. Thank you!<br/><br/>On my claim that "Vampires are all about rage"; I must correct myself; I often mix my thoughts on vampires and werewolves. <i>Werewolves</i> are all about rage to me, while vampires are more about <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the monstrosity of cynicism</span>.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Dracula, the quintessential vampire story, was clearly about sex and lust, not rage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: masqueradeball</cite>I don't know that I agree that Dracula was about sex and lust. When I read it, Dracula seemed like a symbol of pure monstrosity, otherness, alienness. I took the romance and the sex between the human characters to be the addition of melodrama to what was essentially a pure horror story. I actually hated the Copolla Dracula for playing up the sex of a Dracula that was described as being very plainly hideous, but I digress...<br/><br/>To me vampires are all about boredom and the dangers of complacency. They're immortal, powerful, and completely useless to the society on which they thrive. They're such a good analogy for alienation and ennui and the existential dilemma. The vampire is the super-youth, the lost boy.</blockquote>Our place in society is very much based on emotional ties and accepting a code of conduct. When severing those ties, and placing ourselves above the code, there are only icy cynicism to replace it. The vampire; eternal, insightful and mighty, is this cynicism packed in a shell of godlike power. I find our modern fascination with this old legend quite fascinating.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_315965">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315965/#Comment_315965" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-09T00:17:18+00:00" title="March  9, 2011 12:17AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><cite>Posted By: migo</cite>So VtM is a Soap Opera?</blockquote>\nAgain, with Anne Rice's novels as the source material at the bullseye of the target, this really shouldn't be a giant shock.<br/><br/>Haven't read any Anne Rice, I was just making the inference from Smallville.<br/><br/>Soap Opera could explain why Vampire LARP is popular.

They're too cool for school. The religious stuff is just superstition, it doesn't really work on them.<br/><br/>So if you want the vampire story to be about cynicism, the way you motivate conflict is to put them in a sincere world that is vulnerable to them. If they want, they can cynically destroy anything, be it good or evil, but creating something eternal is challenging and rewarding.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>Could it be a solution to make newly turned vampires, with no social network of "vampire-politics" to embrace them, and with budding, but unreliable, powers?</blockquote>\nThe "vampire society" is pretty well ingrained in the modern conception of the vampire, that's not to say your version can't jettison it. I would be cautious in doing so. Without someone who has "been there" the players will have no one to say "that's cool, I want to do that" or "that's terrible, I don't want to end up like them".\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>How will the characters interconnect?</blockquote>\nThis is virtually impossible without a vampire society of some kind. You could make your game so that every game is about a group of people all infected by the same vampire at approximately the same time, or a group of vampires hunted by an ancient sect of assassins at approximately the same time, but with no commonalities except "cynicism", there is no game.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>And how do a vampire relate to a society skilled in meeting all kind of monstrosities with raw power (sword and sorcery)?</blockquote>\nThe modern vampire novel has much to offer here. Normally they are not the apex predator and they do a lot of hiding out/covering up their existence. In WoD games, vampire hunters were a real threat.

Everyone's a vampire and mortals are either enemies or pawns. And the primary focus of the game is all about interactions between vampires. BORING!<br/><br/>If you look at vamp lit, almost all of it, from the more horror-focused Dracula to the more romance-focused post-Rice stories, focuses on the interactions of humans and vampires. Sure, the Rice stories had a lot of inter-vampire story, but the frame story was an interaction with a mortal. And other later examples like Twilight are all about vamp/mortal interactions.<br/><br/>Vampires only matter as characters in the way that they interact with mortals. And if that interaction is minimized, leaving the mortals as puny extras, then you might as well don the capes and call it a supers game.<br/><br/>The story in a vampire game is not in whether or not a vamp can punch out a mortal. It's about whether or not he wants to. Cause that mortal is the brother of his tragic love. Or a well-loved townie who will be noticed if he goes missing.<br/><br/>You can give the vampires all sorts of powers. Just as long as you give them tons of compelling reasons not to use them. And make those decisions and consequences the CONSTANT focus of the game.<br/><br/>Basic Sorcerer playstyle. It's not about whether or not you can get what you want. It's about what you are willing to risk to get it.<br/><br/>Another option is to dramatically play up the weaknesses. Holy symbols. Running water. Daytime. Garlic. Fire. Silver. Wild rose. Hawthorne.

Just because VtM made that choice, means it's a necessity?<br/><br/>What if you don't say "this is a game about vampires" and instead you say "this is a game about vampires and mortals interacting, cause that's where the good stories are".<br/><br/>If you need to set different expectations, then do so.<br/><br/>Smallville isn't a game "about superheroes". It's a game "about complicated, soap-opera-ish relationships that can potentially include people with wacky powers". Which is exactly why I think it's perfect for playing vamps. Cause vampire stores are about complicated, soap-opera-ish relationships that include people with wacky powers (and mortals who don't).\n<blockquote><br/>YES!

It's just a redwashed campaign about people.<br/><br/>Just like if your drow campaign doesn't focus on the distance/tension/interaction between what drow are like and what non-drow are like, then it isn't really a campaign about drow. It's just a blackwashed campaign about people.<br/><br/>Just like if you're running a Star Trek campaign and every race you come across acts just like regular people. The blue skin and green skin and crinkly skin doesn't matter at all unless they indicate a cultural differentiation and that differentiation is explicitly explored.<br/><br/>I think you should mentally explore the notion of why isn't this game Serial Killer The RPG. What makes it different? Because Serial Killer The RPG gives you adrenaline and hunts and destructive compulsions and moral dilemas. So what EXACTLY is different in a vampire game?<br/><br/>And note, Dexter, to the best of my knowledge, (haven't seen the show, so this is hearsay) doesn't spend all his time hanging out with a squad of serial killers.

There are, I'm sure, some amazing stories to be told where every single character is a vampire living in a world of vampires.

I don't think the vampire society thing is the biggest reason why the game misses that personal gut wrenching horror thing that so many people are looking for, I think the reason why that is lacking, or not as present as some of the games self promotion would suggest, is that Vampire, like nearly every other (commercially) successful role playing game in the history of role playing games, is an adventure game. That's the strain on the premise, its about vampires going on and having adventures, and in that context, it does a really good job. But adventure and horror have nothing in common, they don't work well together. The average RPG's quest for protagonization, of escapism and of "exciting" content undermines many of the things most necessary to good horror.

To go a little (maybe a lot?) off topic, I don't think until someone does the things well that VtM does poorly, it will be possible for VtM to have the legacy I think it deserves. There was a revolution, to my mind, in gaming, going on in the late eighties and early nineties, and Vamp was a big part of that revolution. It was a failed revolution for a lot of people, but someday there will be an "old school renaissance" for what was old school when us second and third generation gamers started gaming, and personally, I can't wait to see it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_316103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316103/#Comment_316103" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-09T23:18:54+00:00" title="March  9, 2011 11:18PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, yeah, VtM was pretty revolutionary, or at least a culmination of trends that looked a whole lot different at the time.<br/><br/>My personal take on what would be revolutionary and call back to that through a dirty hippy lens?<br/><br/><i>The Taste of Blood: An Anthology of 30 Short Roleplaying Story Games about Vampires </i><br/><br/>There yez go.

More often if they abuse their vampiric powers (obviously at the cost of a chance to replenish another trait).<br/><br/>When a pool is fully depleted, it is gone.<br/><br/> If, during a scene, a vampire's blood is depleted,  another player gets to initiate/define in next vignette how the beast taking other made said vampire fuck up one resource.<br/><br/>On another note: I'd enjoy Herzog's Nosferatu more if not for the whole Nazi allegory.
