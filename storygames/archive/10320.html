Also, next to talking about my children, it's the easiest request to fulfill. And I have no children.<br/><br/>Diaspora is the result of our table drift from Spirit of the Century. It's what happens when Brad reads a game, loses the book, and then teaches what he remembers to a table of smart cookies. Then there's some iteration between reading the book, aha-ing, and thinking it would be really funny to adapt a physics-simulation game concept (Traveller) to a story-simulation game. And so, Diaspora is the punch-line to a very long comedy of errors. As a design, that is. As a game to be played it is deadly serious. If you like.<br/><br/>Anyway, here's the morsels.<br/><br/>We like mini-games. There's a strong movement away from the mini-game and towards more unified systems. This is the fault of software development principles getting into everything. Being a software designer and developer, I am free to break those rules. So Diaspora has four distinct tactical mini-games that use FATE but differ in details from each other. Not a ton and not aggravatingly, but enough to make them their own entity and in ways designed to serve play.<br/><br/>Personal combat runs like SotC combat. As one author said, you make some guys and then you fight them. It's on a zone map, plays well with miniatures and is tuned towards cooperation. Personal heroics generally don't work unless your pals deliberately support your heroics. That turns out to rock with the horns out. In the personal combat section we also introduce the "vertical cross section" map abstraction: when fighting in a mult-level ship, draw the ship as a vertical cross-section instead of a series of plan-view levels. Abstract the line-of-sight issues with one of two "level" features: cluttered (nothing happens except at range zero) and complicated (nothing happens except at range zero or one). That lets you simulate a vertical shaft through a circular deck with 9 rooms using only three zones and a feature. It's clearer if you read the book. Much clearer if you buy your own copy.<br/><br/>Social combat runs like personal combat except the abstract in the map layout is very heavy. We expect the players to provide a great deal of creativity here and wave our hands a lot. Actors may or may not be characters -- they might instead be whole organizations or even abstractions. In a locked room murder mystery, for example, we chose to represent the murderer as The Murderer and maneuvering that "pawn" into the right place on the map would reveal (or grant the right to narrate the truth about) the murderer's identity. Social combat is more about position than about inflicting stress. A seduction might be a bulls-eye with "true love" in the middle and "just friends at the outer edge. manipulating bothe yourself and your lover into the bulls-eye would be a success. Maneuvering your rival into "just friends" but not succeeding at the bulls-eye before time runs out is also a result with story attached. Rich rich ground for narration through interpretation.<br/><br/>Space combat is essentially a chase mechanism. We decided two crucial things: it's the spacecraft that's the actor and the only interesting thing about position is how far away you are (and how fast you're separating). So space combat takes place in a very rigid inside-out turn sequence (rather than going from actor to actor and getting actions, each phase a sepcific kind of action and all actors perform it -- move, shoot, electronic warfare, repair) and takes place on a one-dimensional map (hello classic Traveller!). It tells shootin' stories well but it tells escape, blockade running, and stealth stories better. And when someone gets taken out, it's the ships that are the actors, so the characters are still in a position to continue the story -- it often leads to a new kind of combat for final resolution (negotiation! boarding party!)<br/><br/>Finally platoon combat is designed to scratch that little-tanks-on-contour-maps itch. The actors are single vehicles or squads of men and there are mechanisms to reward cohesion into platoon groups. Like Striker, command and control are essential, but unlike Striker, the story is simulated rather than the physics. Again, cooperation is rewarded heavily -- one tough tank unit cannot clear the field -- he needs infantry to spot and set up favourable Aspects on the environment, and needs the support of the other tanks in the platoon to make a decisive assault.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229433">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229433/#Comment_229433" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-01T18:06:46+00:00" title="September  1, 2009  6:06PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Because we have so much rich mechanism in the (optional, though that's a dirty word for me -- of course it's optional because I CAN'T MAKE YOU DO THINGS (thank you JD Corley)) mini-games, we strip down FATE proper. Roll, add your skill, manipulate through tags and invokes yadda yadda. We left out blocking because we never used it. We left out static modifiers because we think it was a moment of weakness to include them. We distill the shopping list of stunts down to a small number of types and invite your to make up the details when shaping your character. We give examples, but in many areas (like stunts) we encourage drift. We are not interested in telling your story. We are enablers.<br/><br/>We kept the 5-cap skill pyramid because we like characters that are Something Guy. In fact, our last pruning of the skill list was exactly this: is it fun to be Water Vehicle Guy? Fuck that. No water vehicle skill (that's still a point of contention but I know that I was right). Is it fun to be Energy Weapon Guy? Hell yes! Electronic Engineer Guy? Meh, but maybe, yes, REPAIR GUY! So the pyramid is a keeper. We're constructing competence myths here (though not necessarily classic heroic myths) and being extremely good at something is part of that.<br/><br/>We found that the FATE rules let you get out of anything because of the magical Concession, so we feed that. The game is brutal and easy to lose any given fight, but the Concession makes loss awesome. So to make it brutal, there are no mooks per se, there are only three stress boxes, we use a 1/2/4 stress mitigation consequence scheme, weapons add to your roll, and you can stack free tags. Oh and you mark your hit stress box AND ALL BELOW. Traveller was fucking dangerous. So is Diaspora, but death is still something that you can avoid if you play the game. Concessions. Chant it.<br/><br/>We found it tempting to throw a lot of Aspects at things so we roped that sucker in to keep Aspects from getting diluted. You can use one Aspect from each scope and no more. That is you can tag one of yours, one of your pals, one on the zone, and so on, but no more from each scope. Except free tags. Have all those that you want. This makes adding a scope powerful, and so getting a weapon with its own Aspect is extra useful -- one more scope to tag from.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, we symmetricalated compels. Anyone can compel anyone. Compels that don't originate from the ref (GM to you kids) are constrained in effect though not narration -- they are basically "lose a turn" offers after the target declares an action. "Marine Able charges the airlock" "Oh I don't think so (fate point) -- the airlock is A HORNET'S NEST OF ROCKET FIRE". "Fuck that (hands a fate point over). WE ARE MARINES." The ref can always compel for story action and players can fish for story compels, but in a fight  we tighten the focus down. Open it up for less wargame feel; crank it down tight for tactical reward.<br/><br/>We include a design system for weapons, armour and spacecraft. They are not what you think.<br/><br/>Most design subsystems are about simulating being a gunsmith or naval architect. Put a barrel this long in an action like this with this kind of ammo and it weighs this much. Fuck that. Our system is a point system that builds equipment balanced by technology level that tell the story you are trying to tell. I don't need disintegrator rules -- an Energy Weapon with Harm 4 and Penetration 0 shouts disintegrator a-plenty to me. Pick your story and the design system makes sure your stats aren't wacky. That's all. If the weapon is a crappy high tech weapon, give it the Crappy (Cheap actually, but Crappy is funnier) stunt. It costs a build point and it doesn't DO ANYTHING. How much crappier do you want? Now the weapon is less effective but not because you accidentally only left room for 27 grains of powder in the cartridge when calculating the cyclindrical volume.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229468/#Comment_229468" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-01T22:16:17+00:00" title="September  1, 2009 10:16PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 1, 2009 10:16PM by nemomeme.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Halfjack</cite>We found it tempting to throw a lot of Aspects at things so we roped that sucker in to keep Aspects from getting diluted.

That's plenty and encourages Maneuvers to place those different kind of Aspects, rather than simply tagging one's own, "Big Damn Hero,"Professional Mercenary," and "This Is My Very Favorite Gun," every time you want to shoot something.  The result is much richer play.<br/><br/>Anyway, it's been great reading through it so far.  Fred Hicks said somewhere that SotC, (as wonderful as it is), was something of a trial run for the Dresden Files RPG, and really could have used a bit more polish.  I have to see how it plays but Diaspora seems like a game that's had the benefit of monkeying around with SotC/Fate for a couple years and added some of that polish.  Along with providing some great genre-appropriate changes for your chosen subject.  Looking forward to getting it to the table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229519/#Comment_229519" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-02T04:43:23+00:00" title="September  2, 2009  4:43AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Brad, you free Sundays?<br/><br/>I'm hosting VGG game day meet-ups every Sunday afternoon this month, at Drexoll in Kits.

In developing the game we gathered that expertise and tried to fold our ideas about HOW and WHAT that exprtise is into the rules. However, because we aren't shy about what we're doing here, if you are deep in a tactical game and fall out of the habit of tying rich narrative to every use of Aspect and instead just say, "Fog of war, +2 on my defense" and throw a chip on the table, it still plays a tight game. That lets you get your mitts on the mechanism more readily, I think, and you can purty up your play later.<br/><br/>If you drop the minigames, you're just playing stripped down FATE and while this still requires substantial expertise to do well, there are less fiddly bits so it's probably easier than some other FATE games. A bit.<br/><br/>The four mini-games are: Personal, Social, Space, and Platoon. That's People Shooting, People Shouting, Ship's Shooting, and Army Fights.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229563">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229563/#Comment_229563" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-02T07:53:13+00:00" title="September  2, 2009  7:53AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool, thanks.

And a huge chunk of that will be what you do when you interpret results. I'm going to ramble a bit now, and I can't see your eyes glazing over, so I'm going to just assume that I have your rapt attention.<br><br>This is not a game for one-shots. This is not a laser-focused story game. This is a loony collision between a fast moving story-game and a clunky old physics game. That's not to say it's a hybrid. Rather it's what's drivable when the collision blows all the unwanted shit off. I better unpack that, as they say.<br><br>I remember when the long list of special case descriptions of what skills did in Traveller did not imply that that's all they did and that was kind of broken because there was no unified mechanism for resolution. I remember when those were obviously examples of all the winging it you were going to do once you mastered the system sufficiently to start doing that.<br/><br/>It's not drift if you're SUPPOSED TO work the rules the way you like. Well, so says I anyway.<br/><br/>So Diaspora does that a fair amount (especially wrt stunts) except rather than hint about it, we leave sockets all over the place and beg you to plug stuff into them. Our stunts section is 5 or 6 pages but almost all of that is a list of examples of how to interpret the stunt categories as specific stunts. It's not a shopping list but rather a launching pad. We put that quality of creative burden on all the players constantly. During cluster creation, the quality of your result will depend a great deal on how invested you are the stories that fall out of the stats and connections between systems, and those stories are your fluff. I always had a bug up my ass about canon and so we deliberately made it impossible. In fact if you're like us you will find yourself keen to finish a campaign so that you can start fresh with a new cluster that is essentially brand new canon for the campaign.<br/><br/>So that's what I have to say about fluff. This is a game that feeds those who feel that all that creative stuff, from interpreting stats to writing history to making house rules, is part of play.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229717/#Comment_229717" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-02T19:16:11+00:00" title="September  2, 2009  7:16PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As someone who thinks that unified mechanics have recently become too much of a given (like "game must have hit points", "game must have rules for falling injury"), I'm really interested to see this direction.

For our group of six, we had 8 systems (so, 1 or 2 systems per player).<br/>Each person is in charge of a system (or two).<br/>We roll 4 Fudge dice to get a score for the system's Technology.<br/>Roll 4 Fudge dice to get a score for the system's Environment.<br/>Roll 4 Fudge dice to get a score for the system's Resources.<br/><br/>From those three numbers spills out a lot of information. A system with -2 Technology ("Industrialization") and +2 Environment ("A garden world and several survivable worlds") and -1 Resources ("Almost viable") has a story built into it: it has pretty weak technological developments, and is already needing to import materials to maintain itself! But, it's got a lot amazing terrain, perhaps verdant jungle or breathtakingly pristine mountains. No tech, no resources, in need of supplies, with nothing to offer but beautiful wilderness? This is clearly a system with interstellar tourism going on.<br/><br/>The next phase is to create 2 Aspects for each System. I was in charge of a system with T1, E-2, R-1. I decided that they'd originally had a much higher tech, but went to war and were decimated (and as a result, are now enslaved). I named the System "Armada" and gave it the tags "Enslaved" and "Reinventing their mythology and cultural identity." It became clear, from the things others were saying about their Systems, that I'd bought the weapons from Ubongo and attempted to attack Byzantium.<br/><br/>The final stage is finding out which systems have handy slipstreams between them. Our cluster was heavily linked, and I ended up linked to Ubongo and Byzantium, along with the communist Kingsberg System.<br/><br/>The story just fell out of this cluster creation thing. I'm not a sci-fi geek, and yet I was loving this. The T/E/R generation took about 45 seconds per system. The ideas we all had from interpreting that set of 3 numbers was diverse and engaging. T3/E3/R-2 has several interesting stories built into it, but still lots of room to create and dream.<br/><br/>This was fun and good. The character creation system runs similarly to SOTC, but has a few neat tricks going on at the same time. Similar format, a bit sleeker. What they've done with Stunts (basically, created open-ended categories that you build your own specifics out of) was neat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230374">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230374/#Comment_230374" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-07T08:04:51+00:00" title="September  7, 2009  8:04AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brad also noted how the collaborative elements of making a cluster together fed into more collaboration when we started making characters.
