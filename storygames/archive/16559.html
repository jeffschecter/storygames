A rule intended to stop one player from telling all the other players what to do.<br/><br/>Is this true? I'm looking at page 70, Players' Role in the GM's Turn, where it says 'players should ... make suggestions about the best course of action.'

A problem could be a conflict but it doesn't have to be. It could merely be a single roll or obstacle to overcome or get pounded by.<br/><br/>Also, there's nothing in the rules that says that a mouse has to follow the orders of the patrol leader, BUT if there is a disagreement then the patrol leader should make the call. I'm guessing this is to keep the game moving. If there are many instances of the mice arguing, it's best to handle those issues during the player's turn. <br/><br/>Also, if a player is constantly going against the rest of the group on the GM's turn, it's possible that Mouse Guard may not be the game they want to play. There's a reason that players can ONLY play as members of the Mouse Guard and not any other type of mouse or animal; the game wouldn't work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379270">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379270/#Comment_379270" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-22T11:05:57+00:00" title="May 22, 2012 11:05AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmmph.
