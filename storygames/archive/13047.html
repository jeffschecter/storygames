Mine were as follows:<br/><br/>Katsumi, my pirate was first up and it was his only scene. He was washed up on the shore (maybe I was chanelling a little of Inception there) and he staggered, vulgar and desperate, up the shore. I came across a small band of villagers and rolled the dice. Two successes! Katsumi improved his Able as he threatened them with his Meteor Hammer and got Financed, relieving the villagers of their loot.<br/><br/>When I got around to a Faction I described a Fire Spirit bursting out of a village well. The peasants had tried to imprison him there and I set about burning the roofs of their huts then rolled my dice. No successes! Curses! Still, I laughed maniacally and loosed off fiery balls sending the villagers scattering, but without any harm to them or benefit to the spirit.<br/><br/>The cool thing was that the colour of the setting made it highly possible to mix in the various characters we had introduced, and so it was we had our first Face Off in the village graveyard.<br/><br/>I framed Joeseph Miller there, surrounded by angry and somewhat fearful villagers, while some villagers fetched Naoki to come and proclaim judgement on the foreigner (he'd had Trapped as his NCon and Pooka had him leave his Into scene overwhelmed and captured by villagers). My Faction for the Scene was Takenaka Katsumi (and in my mind he had some connection with Nobu Masa), he sent his Dark figures in lowly dress to cause trouble and make both Miller and Naoki look fools. So, I instigated a riot at the appropriate point of the scene and called for the roll. I wanted Naoki and Miller to both be Humiliated (and I think Pooka might feel "Shamed" or "Disgraced" works better in the colour?!).<br/><br/>The outcome of the roll was a three-way tie on 3 successes, which was great! Miller let off a pistol and then fled in terror from his own gun, Naoki had seen off the foreigner but only with the clear help of the Shogunate Noble and not his own power, as both were humiliated. They alos got their Scene Goals and everyone loaded up on increases and PCons. Crucially, no other NCons were being handed out as everyone was a winner.<br/><br/>The led on to Miller running into Yono (a Beast) on the next scene with a cross (the cross was Miller himself I think). Yono had been at the graveyard moments before the mob's arrival and they formed an uneasy alliance. It could have been a colour scene, but I think they rolled for it and got more out of it (Scene Goals plus 2 Outcomes each).<br/><br/>I think my favourite scene was the one between the Fire Spirit (played by Robert as the Controller) and Naoki (played by Shona). Naoki had betrayed the Fire Spirit on the previous scene (behind his back) and when Robert framed the follow-up scene with the angry Fire Spirit it was perfect. The previous scene had left Naoki both injured and dying, and this led to the Scene Goals of "Kill Naoki" and "Naoki doesn't get killed", our only directly opposed Scene Goals of the session. In the end Shona rolled one success and Robert got three! Death! BUT... Shona as a loser could spend a PCon (Hardened, how appropriate) to get a tick on a Goal box as she had rolled a success on Willing (the final box she neeeded for Naoki to get his Goal). So the Fire Spirit killed Naoki and took his Soul, but the now Soul-less Naoki staggered dying up to the Shogunate's palace to die there and fulfill his goal of proving himself.<br/><br/>I should also mention Deals. Robert's assassin handing, fearfully, his family's dagger over to the Fire Spirit so that it spared him was great. What a harsh deal. We got to imagine the family ancestor spirits housed in the blade screaming as they were subsumed to the will of Taka-Katsu, and he didn't get much out of it (1 success?!).

He's working on some edits to it and I think if we add a little AP and fix some lists it'll be very cool. I'm planning on printing them out as small little black and white booklets and putting them inside copies of Remember Tomorrow I sell at cons.<br/><br/>The "hook" behind the fiction is as true for Edo as for Cyberpunk. What badness do you cause when cutting a deal with a Faction? Who do you crash into to get ahead? Is your Goal worth it? Are you Ready, Willing and Able to see it through? It's a great fit.<br/><br/>Pooka is a big fan of shock: social science fiction so I can see why Remember Tomorrow totally appeals to him. I like to think that Remember Tomorrow leaves some of the antagonism/protagonism decisions in the hands of the players rather than setting it up as rigidly as shock: does. Players can find their own comfort in what role they play at the table (some are more happy being antagonistic, others less so; some want to invest more in their PC, others find a Faction they like more). Freeing up the Controller to to decide what story to "see" next on their turn, seems to allows for a happier coherence to stories and play in my experience too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_296196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296196/#Comment_296196" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-07T16:27:22+00:00" title="October  7, 2010  4:27PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 7, 2010 4:29PM by Andy.">edited October 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was kinda waffling on the names bit: Unfortunately, most of the names are mostly really modern. It would be like a western setting with characters named "Chad", "Vinny", "Traci", "Lashawn", etc.<br/><br/>I went ahead and dug through some real Edo-era names for men, women and samurai, and here's some alternates:<br/><br/>(note that all "-nosuke" are more pronounced "-no-ske")<br/><br/><b>Male:</b><br/><br/>Rikizou<br/>Kichizou<br/>Kouhachi<br/>Gorou<br/>Tamajirou<br/>Matsubei<br/>Umekichi<br/>Momosuke<br/>Shingo<br/>Seizou<br/><br/><b>Female:</b><br/>(note: adding an "O-" to the beginning of each of the names below produces a completely different name, add to taste)<br/>Chiyo<br/>Ran<br/>Michi<br/>Kuni<br/>Shiro<br/>Hana<br/>Ichi<br/>Taki<br/>Mine<br/>Natsu<br/><br/><b>Samurai (male):</b><br/>(actually, the existing list/assemblage in Remember Edo == fine. But while I was on a roll with historic or "cool" names...)<br/><br/>Toranosuke<br/>Zanshirou<br/>Ryuunosuke<br/>Senjuurou<br/>Tsuruemon<br/>Rannosuke<br/>Suzuichirou<br/>Takijuurou<br/>Juugoro<br/>Genkurou<br/><br/>Maybe that will help folks. Took a bit of searching, as there's no real resource in Japan for Japanese people looking for Edo names to use in RPGs and stories and the like, but this was compiled from borrowing from history, stories, some historic resources, and even an Edo-themed monster hunting RPG called Ayakashi which has got to be the fattest Edo-era setting resource I've ever friggin' seen.<br/><br/>Also, I'd add to the "Lowlife" tag the ideas of underworld people with no familial/region ties (stricken from family registers) like masseuses (blind), firemen, and yuujo (prostitutes/courtesan).<br/>I'd add to Gaijin (or elsewhere in the notes) that it's mostly Dutch western doctors or missionaries.<br/><br/>As for Factions, I'd erase Yakuza and include it in "gang" (the proto-yakuza was basically a well-behaved gang, although there were certainly "real gangs" of kabuki-mono, crazy ronin and the like).<br/>Instead of Yakuza, I'd either use:<br/>* Entertainers : Entertainers, groups of theatre performers, wandering musicians and troupes, were able to sway public opinion and change the minds of common folk and even royalty.<br/>or<br/>* Vassal Household: Not necessarily affiliated with the Shogunate, but an estate of samurai looking out for the interests and promotion of their own family members and family name.<br/><br/>Also a note that Commerce is probably one of the most powerful, game-changing factions: It was the new flow of money, and the rise of the merchant class, that led to the end of the samurai way of life. Merchant families and organizations work publicly and privately to their own ends.<br/><br/>Just some thoughts to hack a hack.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_296225">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pooka" title="Pooka"><img alt="Pooka" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y136/pooka_fn0rd/appleb-1.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pooka">Pooka</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296225/#Comment_296225" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-08T01:54:29+00:00" title="October  8, 2010  1:54AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Emily Care likes my hack?

It basically was all the people, by chance, birth, or action, that were cast out of their family registers (kouseki shouhon): And in the day, without a family register to back up your existence (like a Birth Certificate), you weren't allowed to own land, work with the government, travel from place to place, or basically exist.<br/><br/>So there were the yakuza who all banded together, and grew as outcasts, prisoners, fuitives etc grew their ranks. But then there were also the travellers, the blind (biwa players, masseuses, etc), that also fell into that underworld category. While probably Lowlife, Undesirable, Unseemly, Outsider etc all are applicable terms, I think that Underworld is probably more fitting: It was a society that existed on the underside of "normal" society. Lowlife and Outsider also are pretty evocative as well, though.<br/><br/>Hope this helps! The Edo period is one of my faves, it's where all the period dramas and serialized TV shows I watch are set in. It's like a wild west without a frontier.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_296296">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pooka" title="Pooka"><img alt="Pooka" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y136/pooka_fn0rd/appleb-1.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pooka">Pooka</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296296/#Comment_296296" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-08T14:14:59+00:00" title="October  8, 2010  2:14PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd be interested in further fiction in the Edo period, if you could make any recommendations.<br/><br/>My only problem with "Underworld" is that it seems to imply a criminal element in some sense.

The link to the translated tales above in my previous post is very similar in style, done by Zach Davisson. In fact Lafcadio Hearn's first tale in his Kwaidan, called Mimi Nashi Hoichi (Hoichi the Earless) and the concepts he used in that tale is the impetus to the design of my Kaidan: a Japanese Ghost Story setting.<br/><br/>Hearn's work greatly influences my development. I visited Lafcadio Hearn's home in Kyoto, back in 1977 when I visited Japan.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
