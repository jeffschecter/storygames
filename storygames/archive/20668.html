Tell me what you think of this list:<br/><br/>Brawl: Unarmed, light blunt weapons. Basically anything bruce lee would use.<br/><br/>Blades: Swords, Daggers and Axes<br/><br/>Heavy: Maces, Morningstars, Polearms, Cloud's Buster Sword. All heavy weapons have some degree of armor piercing.<br/><br/>Reach: Semi-ranged weapons, as throwing knives, chains and whips. Most ninja weapons.<br/><br/>Ranged: Anything that shoots projectiles, from bows and slings to flintlock guns.<br/><br/>Is there anything I'm forgetting?  any ideas of how could I word the "brawl weapons" without resorting to the Bruce Lee comparison?

I want to emphasize that this may not be a problem for you (you may have other overriding reasons for prioritizing these categories), but if it is, I would recommend an entirely different starting point in that case - perhaps something like unarmed/melee/shooting/exotic (with the specific expanse of the latter bought separately to cover whatever exotic forms of fighting the character might practice).<br/><br/>Specifically, as you asked about the separation between heavy and light blunt weapons: in real life the fighting techniques involved in using a mace are more similar to those used with a sword than they are to those used with a polearm; a sword is likewise more similar to a mace than a dagger; finally, a dagger is more similar to boxing than it is to a sword. Thus, from a realistic point of view I think you'd be best off splitting the "Blades" category between "Brawl" and "Heavy", and renaming "Heavy" to reflect the fact that it covers basically all combat with melee weapons. Maybe split "Heavy" into two if you think that the special nature of two-handed polearms merits a separate skill.<br/><br/>(Think that "Melee" is too broad? In that case, on realistic grounds, you'd probably want to split it into three categories: one-handed weapons, top-heavy weapons and two-handed weapons. Despite all of those being reasonably suited for general melee, they each involve certain broad principles that differ from the other categories.)<br/><br/>As for the coverage, I suppose a net used as a weapon would fall into "Reach" because it's not anything else. That would go for most exotic weapons, I suppose. I think you're covering most things here.<br/><br/>I don't know about how to improve the description of "Brawl". If the conceptual definition of the category really is "light blunt weapons", then I think that pretty much suffices as a description as well - I understand what it covers and what it doesn't, at least. Maybe you could explain the reasoning further for the reader, as they may come to wonder what makes light blunt weapons so special as to merit their own weapon skill category...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453783">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453783/#Comment_453783" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-10T12:45:20+00:00" title="June 10, 2016 12:45PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 10, 2016 12:46PM by zircher.">edited June 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps split reach into Flexible and Thrown?

And maybe split ranged into bows and projectiles because archery is significantly different from crossbows and pistols.  Yeah, that's seven, but it feels right to me.  You could change Brawl and Blade to Light and Medium, then the emphasis is not on the exact tool but the techniques used to wield weapons of that size and reach.

After that you have "control of the tactical situation" as a main factor to decide which weapon is more useful in determined circumstances.<br/><br/>So, gaining experience in the use of a weapon gives you a better grasp of your reach vs the enemy reach, as well as giving you more options to gain or recover tactical advantage when you're in reach disadvantage.<br/><br/>But that's just another viewpoint into the subject, it would also make sense that once you learn how to wield a blunt lever-powered weapon you could wield anything as long as you have enough strenght to lift it. Swords share some of the principles but offer other advantages and difficulties, as well as daggers. Having practiced martial arts myself it makes sense to me to give them a separate place, as they compensate a lack of range with the extra mobility, tactic and knowledge about how and where to hit an opponent to maximize the damage.<br/><br/>Perhaps you could use mixed categories? Like an axe would be heavy+blade, a dagger light+blade, a tonfa would be light+blunt, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453791">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453791/#Comment_453791" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-10T17:36:32+00:00" title="June 10, 2016  5:36PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What are you going for with separate categories and improvement tracks?  Is this a strategic balancing game, where being good at different things confers different advantages in different situations?  If so, then your desired categories depend on how you differentiate situations.  If play is about the differences between fighting spear-wielding dudes and knife-wielding dudes, then cool, your rules and categories should reflect that.  But if a spear fight and a knife fight are basically the same, then you should probably focus elsewhere.  Do you have inspirations for what sorts of fights and encounters you want your players to go through?<br/><br/>Or maybe my guess is off and it's not about tactics, but about flavor?  With just a teeny bit of practical difference thrown in to reward specialization and reinforce niches?<br/><br/>Without knowing your general play goals and any specific technical goals you may have, I'd propose these weapon/unarmed types: grappling, striking, ambush, punishing, demon-bound, elemental.  I enjoy the differences between those situations.  I can also enjoy a good spears vs knives combat, but only if the rules for maneuvering in and out of range are interesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453793">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453793/#Comment_453793" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-10T18:36:27+00:00" title="June 10, 2016  6:36PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 10, 2016 6:39PM by Paul_T.">edited June 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with David, above: what are your goals for creating this taxonomy?<br/><br/>That will determine what kinds of answers would be most useful to you. Are you going for niche protection, game balance, stylistic unity, simulation of historical training, colourful styles, or something else?<br/><br/>I have two suggestions, just off the top of my head:<br/><br/>* Perhaps, rather than talk about the type of weapon used, look at a cultural/background of familiarity. A knight might be equally comfortable with a sword or a lance (even though they're very different weapons), whereas a Mongolian horse archer might be great with a bow (from horseback, no less!) or a short chopping sword. A street brawler could use a table leg without problem, but might feel out of sorts with a sword.<br/><br/>So, for example, during character creation, you might pick your background/training and that would come with a list of familiar weapons. For other weapons, you could simply default to "unfamiliar" (with some appropriate penalty or whatever), or you could have a brief rubric, like:<br/><br/>- Is the weapon of an unfamiliar style or construction? -1.<br/>- Is the weapon similar to something you are experienced with? If not, -1.<br/><br/>So, a familiar weapon is best (no penalty), a sword from a different culture is a -1, and a weird weapon you have no experience with is at -2. <br/><br/>Then you don't need a strict taxonomy; you could either have a list of weapons ("here are the weapons used in Southern France during the 12th century") or make an educated guess on the fly ("Yeah, this would be familiar to an Orcish warrior from the North, but it's made by Elves, so -1.").<br/><br/>* When I've attempted this kind of thing in the past, I've tried to separate all the possible weapons into strict categories - this one belongs here, that one belongs there. After some thought, I decided this was unproductive (too many weapons were borderline cases). So I would advise that, if you do this, you have provisions for overlapping categories and weapons which fit in several categories.<br/><br/>That will make it cleaner and easier, and means you don't HAVE to cover every possible weapon with a set number of categories, as well. (Which, otherwise, will force you to place some weapons in categories that don't QUITE fit, and take them out of others where they arguably could. Would an archer be better with a crossbow, or a rifleman? I don't know.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453795">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cuchulainn" title="Cuchulainn"><img alt="Cuchulainn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cuchulainn">Cuchulainn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453795/#Comment_453795" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-10T22:29:01+00:00" title="June 10, 2016 10:29PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To give a little more background, you guessed right: is not as much about tactics than niche protection.

To get the Final Fantasy aesthetic, you then decide that whatever weapons the player characters happen to master are the types of weapons that pop up everywhere all the time; this way you get those funky arms dealers who routinely sell "battle fans", conveniently for the character class that just happens to use fans, and only fans, as weapons. Likewise, all the drops from enemies are <i>somebody</i>'s mastered weapons, with perhaps the occasional exception to reward generalists and expanding horizons.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453805">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453805/#Comment_453805" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-11T18:40:04+00:00" title="June 11, 2016  6:40PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 11, 2016 7:11PM by David_Berg.">edited June 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like Eero's idea.  The only downside I see is if multiple players get inspired to make weapons that are too similar to each other.  To avoid that, I think you could list a number of specialist categories, and then have some bidding or dice or whatever determine who gets first, second, third, etc. pick of their specialist category.<br/><br/>These categories could be the five you suggested, or they could describe stylistic niches instead, like <b>overwhelming</b>, <b>polished</b>, <b>athletic</b>, <b>sneaky</b>, and <b>vicious</b>.  Sometimes the difference between an elegant fencing sword and an armor-cleaving sword describes two characters better than the difference between a sword and an axe.<br/><br/>If I were running with the basic idea of your five categories, I guess I'd do:<br/><b>close</b> - fists, bass knuckles, knives, tonfa, blackjack<br/><b>flexible</b> - whips, chains, nunchucks, flails<br/><b>crushing</b> - maces, spiked maces, clubs, a log with a nail in it, warhammers, giant swords &amp; axes<br/><b>blades</b> - swords from pretty small to pretty big<br/><b>reach</b> - spears<br/><b>staves</b> - staves<br/><b>thrown</b> - knives, shuriken, hand axes, darts<br/><b>missile</b> - arrows and slings<br/><br/>To me, these all have distinct flavor, and having 8 means no one's likely to get stuck with one they don't like.  <br/><br/>Any left unused could get folded into the ones that are used.  If no one takes "thrown" then the "missile" player gets thrown weapons.  If no one takes "staves", then the "reach" player gets staves... unless the "crushing" player wants it more and it fits their concept better.<br/><br/>Or maybe just use Eero's idea and tell the players "nothing too close to each other."  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453806/#Comment_453806" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-11T19:04:45+00:00" title="June 11, 2016  7:04PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Weapon categories:<br/><br/>* Weapons to kill knights, aristocrats and kings<br/>* Wastes of time                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453809">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cuchulainn" title="Cuchulainn"><img alt="Cuchulainn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cuchulainn">Cuchulainn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453809/#Comment_453809" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-11T20:21:22+00:00" title="June 11, 2016  8:21PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/><br/>For these purposes, wouldn't it make most sense to just make a generic talent "Master of Weapon [whatever]", and say that the character gets +2 with that weapon and +1 with weapons "similar" to it, with similarity judged on a case by case basis? To get the Final Fantasy aesthetic, you then decide that whatever weapons the player characters happen to master are the types of weapons that pop up everywhere all the time; this way you get those funky arms dealers who routinely sell "battle fans", conveniently for the character class that just happens to use fans, and only fans, as weapons. Likewise, all the drops from enemies are <i>somebody</i>'s mastered weapons, with perhaps the occasional exception to reward generalists and expanding horizons.</blockquote>\nThat is exactly my plan, including the battle fans thing.

Use whatever weapon list you want, powergamers will go for the one with higher damage/longest range. Roleplayers will chose one more suited to the character than to the enemied they will face. Weapons with situational use will rarely be used in play so the most exotic ones will be a waste of space on the list. <br/><br/>Going to the other side of the spectrum into minimalism, letting players come up with a weapon of their choice and then assigning them all the same damage has worked for me but only because I often ask my players about how they use their weapons, which produces more or less the same result you obtain with this list. Except that presenting this list to the players would definitely do wonders for inspiration! Not only that I believe it will definitely do wonders by interacting with the deterministic mechanics we discussed in the other therad, right?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453841">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453841/#Comment_453841" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-13T18:53:25+00:00" title="June 13, 2016  6:53PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 13, 2016 6:54PM by David_Berg.">edited June 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">@WarriorMonk</a>, maybe!  I'm not sure exactly where "cool description" and "what could/should happen" meet.  Probably a discussion for another thread, unless it comes up here...<br/><br/>For this thread, I do agree with you about the risks of making weapon choice purely effectiveness-based.  I think the OP's plan to make every specialty a +2 will render that a non-issue, but I am left wondering if the situational differences between daggers and spears and bows will matter.  <br/><br/>My most common experience with this across games is that ranged vs hand-to-hand is the only relevant distinction, and that if you're a bow specialist you are sometimes incredibly useful and sometimes basically useless, whereas if you're anything else you're always somewhat useful.  But there's no reason that <i>has</i> to be the case.  We'll see if the OP has thoughts on that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453845">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cuchulainn" title="Cuchulainn"><img alt="Cuchulainn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cuchulainn">Cuchulainn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453845/#Comment_453845" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-13T22:35:19+00:00" title="June 13, 2016 10:35PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm seeing a lot of good ideas and I'm still pondering all of them, even if it's just for the sake of Game Design.

Just to point something: I know that it is not a very realistic classification, but I don't think there is a way to realistically do this, much more using only 6 slots (the reason for not exceding 6 is purely aesthetical, as the random tables in this game use always 1d6)<br/>So, some divisions were made thinking usually about the tone of the jrpgs.
