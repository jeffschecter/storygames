(I've talked about this before in some of <a href="/forums/profile/KomradeBob%27s">@KomradeBob's</a> other posts.)<br/><br/>So, I've been mulling over a simple little Pirates-themed game, because I bought a bunch of the new pirate sets to add to my 90s pirates. Also, I love good natured swashbuckling fun--something like <i>The Court Jester</i> is the gold standard for this, but <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i> or similar is great inspiration, too.<br/><br/>Yesterday, I had to wait in the car for a few minutes for my family, so I typed up a little outline on my phone. It's definitely descended from thoughts generated by a few recent threads, like the ones on Stunting, <a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen%27s">@Eero_Tuovinen's</a> princess-play game, etc.<br/><br/>I was going to post it today anyway, but it's now especially timely given <a href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer%27s">@Hopeless_Wanderer's</a> post. That's not to say that it necessarily satisfies his criteria, but it does show a couple of minor techniques in how I like to use LEGOs for this style of game. <br/><br/>Here it is:<br/>------------------<br/><br/>LEGO Pirates Minifig Swashbuckling Game<br/><br/>All characters have a background and an occupation. Signal one of the two with an accessory and the other with with the minifig's body/dress.<br/><br/>Action: To do something, describe it. It happens the way you say, unless someone resists you (including the force of nature). If you face resistance, see Resolution, Target, and Danger, below. To take an action, you must be fictionally positioned to do so; otherwise, take other actions until you are in a place to achieve your goal.<br/><br/>Resolution:  Take one point to start. (You can count points on your fingers.) If any of the following apply, describe how and claim another point per category:<br/>-- My background or occupation gives me an advantage. <br/>-- I'm much better prepared than my opponent (advance planning, material preparation, the element of surprise, social leverage, etc.). (N.b.: The difference in preparation here should be obvious and significant.)<br/>-- I'm a badass. Spend your Swashbuckling Token and describe how you do something totally badass. <br/>-- I'm getting help! (The helper describes how and spends their Swashbuckling Token.)<br/><br/>Target: The GM (or, better, the player to your left or right) rolls a d6. If your points match or equal the roll, you get what you want. If your points are less than the roll, you don't get what you want, and the situation also gets worse in some way. (The GM says how.)<br/><br/>Danger: If you fail the roll, you can tell the GM that you are willing to risk injury, loss, or setback in order to succeed. The GM will tell you the risk. If you accept, then you actually do get what you want, but you also suffer the danger suggested by the GM. Consequences may include: you suffer a new injury commensurate with the action; you exacerbate an existing injury; you lose an important item; you get put in a hard place or have to make a hard decision; you imperil an innocent; your enemies gain an advantage; etc. In general, the severity of the Danger matches the magnitude of the Action: grand goals risk dire dangers.<br/><br/>Swashbuckling: If your described action is daring, clever, or flashy, and especially if it uses the environment cinematically, claim a Token. (This standard is to be applied liberally and in good faith!) You may immediately spend the Token on the action, if you'd like, or you can hold it for a future action. You can hold just one Token.<br/><br/>Help: If you help someone else with their action, spend your Token and describe how you help. (You can still help if you aren't holding a Token, but it doesn't add to their points.)<br/><br/>Reputation: Your Token starts as a standard 2x2 LEGO brick in a color of your choice. Whenever you accomplish a notable exploit (like finding a famous buried treasure, rescuing an important person, foiling a villainous menace, etc.), build on a decoration to the block to commemorate or symbolize your exploit. (The decoration is composed of however many blocks you think are appropriate--the overall size of your token will grow as rumor of your exploits does.) The more ornate your Token, the more likely NPCs are to know about your character (and thus to show them deference, fear, respect, etc.).<br/><br/>Advice:<br/>-- Err on the side of more detail/description. Refer back to fictional details that have already been established. <br/>-- Everyone: ask lots of questions of other players, then incorporate the answers. <br/>-- Use the environment. Describe cinematic actions. Swashbuckle! <br/>-- Violence isn't the answer; swashbuckling is. Don't just go around stabbing adversaries if you can push them into the water, bury them under a pile of debris, humiliate them publicly, escape by leaping on a chandelier, steal the love interests' heart, trap *them* in the cell, or otherwise be a lovable rascal! <br/>-- Build stuff out of LEGOS and then deconstruct it to show how much you love playing with the stuff. Boats, towns, lairs, islands, interiors, vehicles, doubloon-filled caves, monuments to your glorious (or accidental) exploits...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453109/#Comment_453109" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-09T18:56:30+00:00" title="May  9, 2016  6:56PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice!<br/><br/>I especially like the visual significance of building up your Swashbuckling Token.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453112">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453112/#Comment_453112" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-09T19:28:30+00:00" title="May  9, 2016  7:28PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 9, 2016 7:28PM by David Artman.">edited May 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Reputation: Your Token starts as a standard 2x2 LEGO brick in a color of your choice.

Seems way too random; or could drive folks to try for the 5 all the time, making for 'overwrought' action descriptions (of course, if solo there's no helper for point 5; and the first two ways to add point 2 and 3 need "approval", so they could often be unattainable).<br/><br/>Also no bell curve, so your success/failure ratio will feel arbitrary.<br/><br/>I presume you have a "Say Yes or Roll Dice" baseline rule (not explicit above) that would not have someone clearly competent roll for something clearly trivial?<br/><br/>Finally, I think static difficulty (d6) is going to be hard to justify with phrases like "In general, the severity of the Danger matches the magnitude of the Action: grand goals risk dire dangers." So if I want to slay a drunk pirate, it's the same roll-under range as if I want to throw a dagger to cut a topsail halyard and bring it down (tantamount to hitting someone in the eye from 100 feet)? Same d6, same bidding for 1-5 points? And the only *actual* aspect of that "increased difficulty" is that, if I want to force success with Danger, the repercussions are *worse* for the harder thing--I guess I break my dagger if I force it? But if I force the slaying... am I injured? (Suddenly, the easier issue seems to have the worse repercussion!).<br/><br/><b>What I might try to fix the above issue(s):</b><br/>0) Say Yes Or Roll Dice: (see above; should be a Rule Zero for most low-granularity/conflict-resolution systems).<br/><br/>1) Relative difficulty = die type (d4, d6, d8, d10, maybe higher): This way, a trivial action is d4 while that dagger throw might be a d12 or d20(!) (yielding at best a 42%/25% chance of success if I drum up all 5 points).<br/><br/>2) Background AND Occupation can be pinged for points: Just allows one to get to 6, even without multiple helpers (see below); might not be that impactful.<br/><br/>3) Multiple helpers allowed: Thus, you and your posse can accomplish those d10+ actions that a soloist would be hard pressed to attempt (i.e., given they would have at best 4 points = 40%/30%/20%). Also allows for interesting setups and descriptions, if each helper must help *<b>in a unique way</b>* (they can't <i>all </i>just say "I distract the opponent by yelling" for instance). [This is basically how Torchbearer helping works, FWIW.]<br/><br/>In closing, for a fast-and-loose conflict-resolution system, it's pretty good, especially if you like high variability and a lot of interpersonal adjudication at the table! And the notion of your 'cred' being encoded into your token is truly brilliant! But I think just a <i>bit</i> more system flexibility would go a long way towards allowing for broader scope of actions without them becoming ludicrously unparallel.

That's one of the reasons I love the Creator line--plenty of normal civilian types. ( <a href="/forums/profile/KomradeBob">@KomradeBob</a> likes to say that you have to have a lot of non-fighty miniatures to make games like this sing, and he's absolutely right. Creator is the best line for a wide diversity of civilians. If you're lucky enough to have a LEGO store in your city, you can also do the Build-a-Minifig thing to collect a lot of civilian parts that you might not have otherwise. I use both to acquire normal, civilian minifigs for e.g. my train sets.) Some of the medieval lines do a good job with civilians, too: the recent-ish Castle line, for example, had a few good sets with lots of mundane setting pieces, like the great one with the blacksmith, inn, and market.\n<blockquote><b>What I might try to fix the above issue(s):</b><br/>0) Say Yes Or Roll Dice: (see above; should be a Rule Zero for most low-granularity/conflict-resolution systems).<br/><br/>1) Relative difficulty = die type (d4, d6, d8, d10, maybe higher): This way, a trivial action is d4 while that dagger throw might be a d12 or d20(!)

There's (at least) two things that I'd forgotten to mention--one is that I very much had "Say Yes or Roll" in my mind as a procedure here.<br/><br/>The other is that I had 8-10 yr olds in mind for this game, which is one reason for the simplistic mechanic. In practice, I imagine that most actions involve a quick count for points (with points granted very liberally), a roll, and a negotiation about dangers pretty much whenever the roll fails. With kids this age, that tends to look something like:<br/>"Uh oh--you don't manage to knock him overboard. Unless, of course, you tackle him, but that would make you go overboard too..."<br/>"I don't want to go overboard!"<br/>"Okay! Then.. maybe you push him overboard, but he grabs onto your cloak, and you have to unclasp it and let it go?"<br/>And back and forth until the kid is happy that their vision is being met, but with an "at a price" that they accept. In other words, this is more a negotiation than I'd written above. (We mainly would need to do this to snowball the fiction. With kids, I find that it is often a struggle to keep the new challenges reasonable related to what came prior.)<br/><br/>With kids, if the failure rate was too high (i.e. they didn't feel like they were getting to express their vision often enough without complication), then I'd first try just starting with two points, and adding one per category. You could also decouple the background/occupation points, like you mentioned, to get even higher points.<br/><br/>With adults, I'd definitely to inclined to use a system with more finesse, though with the goal of keeping it quick and easy. (Adults can also be more sanguine about the "danger" rule--no matter how many hits you take, you can always succeed if you really want to/when it really matters for your vision of your character.) <br/><br/>The mechanic that you talked about above is a very good option--I especially like the idea of multiple helpers. In the fiction that I have in mind, protagonists often end up with a lot of help--some of it unintentional--to "get away with it," so to speak. The mechanic that you outlined should be totally workable in play.<br/><br/>When I was thinking about adults, I'd originally had something like this in mind:<br/><b>Target Numbers:</b> A static 4 for a relatively easy task, 6 for a moderately difficult task, 8 for a particularly challenging task.<br/><b>Points:</b> Start with a d4, then step up a die for each of the following: one for background/occupation; one for preparation; one for swashbuckling; one for assistance. Mostly you'd be rolling d8s and d10s, with the occasional d6 or d12. Roll the target number or higher, and you succeed.<br/><br/>That doesn't solve all the problems that you discussed--e.g. the randomness issue, or especially grubbing for points. (To be fair, my experience has been that adults/gamers tend to do more point-grubbing than younger kids. Those who want this kind of toy-focused play aren't usually too focused on trying to get maximum points.) But I agree that a more-baked version of this idea would probably need a more robust mechanic.<br/><br/>Still, I'm not sure that either system really nails what one wants out of princess play, which is for your character to encounter adversity <i>but persevere without sacrificing your vision for the character</i>. That second bit is important, because it means that you might be willing (or even eager) for setbacks, but only of a certain kind--namely, not vision-compromising ones. <br/><br/>To solve the problem, I first thought to have player and GM negotiate about the nature of the setback/adversity, but it's worth thinking about other ways to get around the issue. Eero's "set a high die out in front of you and you're the narrative boss right now" in the Sipi game is a totally different approach to preserving character vision/potency in a way that insulates the player from vision-compromising outcomes.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453144/#Comment_453144" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-10T12:27:58+00:00" title="May 10, 2016 12:27PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I tend to think the original dice system is just fine for the vast amount of uses.

Offhand, I can think off several add-ons that could provide 'mechanical richness' without added "complexity":<br/>* Cloaks - either LEGO-made or hand-made with construction paper or vinyl. Could convey "defense" or any number of other common character tropes ("sneaking").<br/>* Backpacks (and other "bodywear" minifig accessories that wedge between the head and torso with a loop, like cloaks do) - could be a point call-on like other equipment or could convey  an ability (re-roll once per session, if you narrate having "the perfect item" in your backpack?).<br/>* Headgear - as above as equipment; or as a way to defensively make an opponent/opposition/GM re-roll once per session (e.g., "armor").

I once played a game (with adults, mind you) where the minifig was the character sheet: If the action was the sort of thing that it looked like your minifig would be good at, then you got a bonus. (If I remember right, we just used it as a binary--advantage or not--but you could easily do it per-piece of gear, too.)<br/><br/>This ends up presenting really interesting choices, since there are limited body parts and gear slots on a minifig. It completely changed the experience of splitting up loot and of item-based quests! In fact, the game became something like artifact-hunters fiction. Eventually, everyone also got pets, and they got tricked out with equipment, too. One guy also started doing body modification and ended up mostly cybernetic (just the minifig head left). <br/><br/>It also makes advancement or prep very different. Before a mission, everyone would outfit their figure with whatever might help most on that job. (They got this wrong a lot, to, which led to some pretty funny improvisation).

There was some core anti-survival pressure (hunger, weather, fatigue -- I don't recall the details) and we could do whatever we wanted to try. We found a pond and fished, we foraged and then planted crops, we mined out cliff-faces and built little huts. We sort of gave up on the game as being too slow around the time that one of us had tamed a wild horse.<br/><br/>So, I think that counts as world-building. E.g. when we found that pond, we built a pond and added it to the play-area. When we mined rock, we accumulated 2x2 plates (or whatever) and then build little houses. The houses only provided bonuses against the weather if that looked visually plausible.

I've always wanted to play an old D&amp;D dungeon module with MK2, where everyone plays an Elite figure (slotted base) and a small cadre of sidekicks (to keep the normal Mage Knight turn system intact) and many of the rewards would be Artifacts or Spellbooks (for slots) and Spells (and just loot for "points"). So, with not much adjustment, MK2 does that too.<br/><br/>Now, if you meant capital-W World Building (i.e., players contribute to setting freely), then yeah--neat point.
