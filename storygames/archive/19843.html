The outcomes look like this:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XYK_sesejWVB36l9QY2BFpGKtF4QUjYvTIVa3xVF39A/pubchart?oid=1384625961&amp;format=image" width="800"/><br/><br/>This had all the properties I want; each pool size has its own distribution of likely outcomes, there are different ranges that are more or less likely depending on the die pool, and you can fill the high end of the table (25-30) with totally ridiculous/ominous things. The downside is that you have to do a lot of adding when the pressure's on.<br/><br/>This seems like the kind of mechanic that probably already exists. Does anyone know of examples that are similar? What would <em>you</em> use this for?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439883">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439883/#Comment_439883" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-04T05:32:07+00:00" title="November  4, 2014  5:32AM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It reminds me most of Cortex Plus in a roundabout way, where you use dice to represent all of the unpredictable factors in a scene. So you might roll a d8 for having the high ground on someone, a d8 for your fighting skills, a d10 for the powerful relationship between the two of you, and a d6 because of something that happened in the last scene that set you at odds.<br/><br/>You roll them all, and add the two highest results.<br/><br/>So it's a little different, but it has the same basic idea. The biggest difference is that any given roll can go as low as 2, or as high as the two largest dice in the pool. And obviously having higher dice makes a higher number more probable, but there's still a lot of unpredictability.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439887/#Comment_439887" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-04T10:09:21+00:00" title="November  4, 2014 10:09AM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been using this one for old school D&amp;D for the last five years or so myself, for the exact reasons you pinpoint. It's ideal for a certain type of random encounter table, for example - roll 1d6 in light woods and 2d6 in heavy woods, say. The last time I used this was for my <a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-30/comment-page-3/?action=preview&amp;uid=40525" rel="nofollow">Ludum Dare game</a> this fall.<br/><br/>More generally, what you describe is simply the older variety of dice pool: instead of evaluating each rolled die individually for pass/fail, you sum the dice up into a total and compare that to whatever. This was used a <b>lot</b> in older games. <i>Tunnels &amp; Trolls</i> and <i>Hero System</i> (Champions) come to mind immediately as examples. A prominent Finnish example is <i>Praedor</i>, in which this is explicitly the universal task resolution roll, with [difficulty]d6 vs. [skill rating].<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439892/#Comment_439892" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-04T12:32:14+00:00" title="November  4, 2014 12:32PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Or use dice pool and let all 5s and 6s count.<br/>Here is an example (you can play around with it, or let all 4-6 count):<br/><a href="http://anydice.com/program/4ad8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://anydice.com/program/4ad8</a><br/>You don't have to add, just count the "dangerous dice".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
