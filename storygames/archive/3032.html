The first run is not yet finished (it's forum-based, and not in English, so no quotes of links), but already some conclusions can be made or at least some issues got me and the others thinking... Below I'm gonna try to explain the situation as brief as possible, ask my questions and shut up waiting for comments.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>The Goal</b> was to make a Nar/Gam system for role-playing in Naruto universe. Naruto is all about ninjas. Anime ninjas, if you insist. Ninjas are cool. Ninjas throw cool shurikens and use other cool techniques to accomplish cool missions. That was the goal.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>The Solution</b> basically was for every character to have a set of <i>talents</i>, some of which are more or less standard and some are more or less unique (slylised versions of Speed, Strength, ShadowTechniques, LookingThroughWalls, etc). We say yes or roll the dice. If there's a conflict, both sides of it explain which talent is used and d6-d6 (we call it dN to be short) is rolled. The value of Talent1+dN is compared to Talent2 (or vice versa, doesn't matter), and the outcome is narrated according to the difference (we have a simple table saying things like "2: an ok success, 6: really cool success, 10: magni-fucking-ficient success with secondary effects, -8: miserable failure", etc). Talents are also used as counters so you can take some points off and add them to that one roll.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>The Rule</b> in question is that after the roll, if one player is unsatisfied, (s)he can say "hold on, I'm not only keen, I'm fast too" and narrate the use of the second (third, fourth) talent. The other side have the right to say their word too. The objective of the rule was to give more control: if the player doesn't want the character to get hit, it seems more achievable this way.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>The Problem</b> seems to be that there is not natural end to this auction short of running out of talents or the game master rejecting your attempt. The playtest shows that the players never want to lose in a conflict if there's still some hope in winning, and it takes a hell lot of time.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo. What do you think? Was the auction a bad idea to begin with? Does it seem inappropriate in the given context? What are your suggestions to fix it? Anything else on you mind after reading this post? Hit me with it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric_J_Boyd" title="Eric_J_Boyd"><img alt="Eric_J_Boyd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric_J_Boyd">Eric_J_Boyd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69209/#Comment_69209" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-15T09:36:59+00:00" title="May 15, 2007  9:36AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 15, 2007 9:37AM by Eric_J_Boyd.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The auction concept sounds good, but there needs to be some consequence for using additional talents and I'm not hearing that in your description. For example, in <i>Agon</i> a player can use other related abilities to get bonus dice in making a roll, but each of these abilities is reduced in effectiveness afterward. So in your auction you could allow players to pull in other talents, but reduce the effectiveness of those talents in later rolls, or maybe have a check-the-box system where each talent can only be used in an auction once until some kind of "refresh" occurs. This turns these additional talents into a limited resource that prompts decision making on the players' part - is success on this roll worth using up so many of my resources?<br><br>Sounds like a neat idea for a game, by the way.

For example, in my upcoming game, players can invoke "Connections" or in other words relationships to boost their rolls. But in doing so, it causes some kind trouble for that relationship (aka a Bang). Something to note here---the way I have it set up, this becomes a positive feedback loop. By invoking Connections, it causes more narrative conflicts &amp; issues, which causes more dice rolling, which causes more invoking, etc. The player doubly wins---they get to win the conflict AND get more narrative conflicts. You may or may not want to do the same.<br><br>Another idea is that calling a second talent grants the <i>other player</i> some kind of resource they can later use against the original player. That sets up a "win now but get screwed later" dynamic.<br><br>Depending on how much book-keeping you are willing to tolerate, another idea is that you can have some sort of fixed economy. In other words, suppose you need to spend "action points" to call a second talent. But instead of these points simply disappearing, they get transferred to the other player. This will likely set up a dynamic where players are willing to lose minor/early conflicts in order to save up for bigger/later conflicts. That may or may not be desirable.<br><br>Yet another idea is you could use some variant of Levi Kornelson's <a href="http://members.shaw.ca/LeviK/Exchange.pdf" rel="nofollow"><i>The Exchange</i></a>, where there's a hierarchy of skills/talents.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69221">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DirkGently" title="DirkGently"><img alt="DirkGently" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DirkGently">DirkGently</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69221/#Comment_69221" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-15T10:02:08+00:00" title="May 15, 2007 10:02AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The auction system is a fine system but I think that Eric has the right idea... some system of consequences is badly needed. It looks like increasing the required 'bid' may do exactly what you are looking for.<br/><br/>One other thing that you might want to consider (borrowing a little bit from 'The Shadow of Yesterday') is that every time you invoke another talent, you have to increase the stakes in the contest too. So, if the players choose to keep testing, they have to accept that if they fail (in the end) the outcome will be far worse than if they had accepted the original outcome.<br/><br/>For example:<br/>Player A is launching a series of flaming shruikens at Player B. They roll and Player B gets hit for a small bit of damage (and some embarrasment). He doesn't like this so he decides to invoke his second talent. The Gamemaster reminds him that if he still fails, after invoking his second talent, the damage will be upgraded to moderate.<br/><br/>An alternate to that, and a method to speed things up, is that you could make everyone declare exactly how many talents they are using at the very beginning (this should probably have some costs, like Eric suggests). So, for very important tasks when I don't want to fail I might decide that I am willing to use three traits... but I make that decision at the beginning and do all the rolling in one step.<br/><br/>I am not the world's biggest Naruto fan... but ninjas are always cool <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_69251">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69251/#Comment_69251" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-15T10:59:52+00:00" title="May 15, 2007 10:59AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Radaghast</cite><strong>The Goal</strong>was to make a Nar/Gam system for role-playing in Naruto universe.

"What do players do" reminds me of <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> of the Power 19... A couple of months ago when I started, I answered that (<a href="http://gns.livejournal.com/874.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>, but not in English, sorry). In short, I want to see the players making up a cool story about their ninjas. "Their" means that each participant has one character in his or her control and is mainly busy with his or her actions. There is a Game Master who takes care of the decorations making sure that the ideas of all the other players do not collide and mix up with world's logic.<br/><br/>Mostly we go for a typical for anime "do now, explain later" style in a sense that if an uber-powerful technique is used but the conflict is resolved not to its user's favour, we can say he or she just didn't use it right, and if a simple and weak technique performs well, we'd say it hit a critical spot or something. I intentionally keep things very simple (talking about hits and misses) because the more complicated the matter, the easier it is to conceal weirdness.<br/><br/>Besides this, Game Master also has something like the abovementioned talents, but that part is not used in this playtest so it's kinda too early to talk about it here.<br/><br/>Coming back to your questions, the ultimate impression I want the players to experience is the feel that they are very much like reading the manga or watching the anime, but even cooler because it's about the characters they invented and not about some "standard" ones. The last part is important because I tend to immer... or shit, I'm not supposed to use that kind of language... sorry... I meant because I tend to think and act in-character and at least several of other players from the same group do the same.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_69342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DirkGently" title="DirkGently"><img alt="DirkGently" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DirkGently">DirkGently</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69342/#Comment_69342" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-15T13:32:30+00:00" title="May 15, 2007  1:32PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>DirkGently, thanks too!

In general, though, GNS tends to be a big red herring and, as many of the very active threads right now suggest, it can be very contentious. I don't think you really need to use the GNS terms to talk about your game design at this stage and you might be better off without the terminology!<br/><br/>For now, let's just talk about your game design problem without all the jargon. Refreshing, eh?<br/><br/>I think you might want to think about what makes a story a good story, too. In my experience, it's hard to pin down a definition that everyone agrees with. But let's say you have a bunch of players who are all fired up about just <i>being</i> ninjas in a Naruto universe -- you know, immersion stuff. What things would ruin that story for the players? How can your game design make sure those things don't happen?<br/><hr/><br/>Now I'll address your specific question about unending talents. Sorry it took so long to get to it! I just wanted to make sure I understood your goals before diving in.<br/><br/>So you want your rules to give players this feeling of <i>fucking cool ninjaness</i>. Awesome. You have this idea that lets players alternate back and forth, bringing in more and more traits, as long as they can narrate some kind of justification. Well, that suggests two limits already. First, a character has only so many talents, right? I assume from your example that you can bring in each only once. Second, the player has to be able to justify using the talent, right? In practice, I've found that players are extremely creative at finding ways to bring in the oddest talents into just about any situation, so it may not be a practical limit.<br/><br/>The other folks in this thread have suggested keen ways to create limits: spending some kind of "currency" to activate talents, suffering a narrative consequence, and so on. I'll also toss in two more suggestions.<br/><br/><b>A. Talents must trump.</b> This is an idea I'm exploring in one of my own designs. In your game, it would be applied thus: you can bring in another talent as long as it has a higher score than the last one you activated. So if you started with Keen 3, then you can't bring in Clever 2 or even Clever 3. But Fast 5 is okay. This has the added benefit of a sort of built-in escalation, which might be part of "create a cool story" for you. The one-upsmanship starts out slow, because people use their weaker abilities first then build up to their best. "Ha! I activate Crane Style 19. I leap off one leg into the air and slam my beak-hand into your head!"<br/><br/>This might just create an order for using talents rather than actually limiting how many get used, though.<br/><br/><b>B. Don't worry about it.</b> If you already have a natural limit (number of talents), and each talent has an unclear effect on the fiction (there's a random element),  let it slide. Are you concerned that the conflicts go too long and players would rather move on to other things? How can you use the rules to make the conflicts more exciting and fun in the first place? Is the handling time (rolling dice, subtracting d6-d6, looking up traits, adding traits, etc.) bogging things down? Maybe they can be streamlined.  <br/><br/>For example, d6-d6 has exactly the same curve as 2d6 but has a different range. Is 2d6 faster for your players than d6-d6 and, if so, can you retool the game by shifting a chart by 6 or 7 points?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
