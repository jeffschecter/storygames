I'm basically looking for Bangs that would tie into their Aspects/Flags. Even if you don't totally understand what's going on with a particular Aspect or character don't worry about it too much--although I think most of them are pretty self explanatory. Any suggestions will be appreciated!<br/><br/>The campaign is an "Amethyst" style Amber campaign where we've come up our own Elder Amberites although Oberon, Dworkin, the Pattern, Trumps, Castle Amber, The Courts of Chaos are all still part of the setting.<br/><br/>I've got five characters--here are a few that I'm having trouble with:<br/><br/>Lucilla<br/>\u2022 Mistress of Illusions.<br/>\u2022 Dark Empress of Pentameron.<br/>\u2022 Disco Queen of Babylon.<br/>\u2022 Tamerlane, faithful and irreverent Majordomo.<br/>\u2022 Maleficarus, the Staff of Doom.<br/>\u2022 Orlando.<br/>\u2022 Return of the Rebel Princess.<br/>\u2022 Nicodemus.<br/>\u2022 Maternal investment in family Amber.<br/>\u2022 Most Glamorous Bitch in the Room.<br/>\u2022 Skills: Sorceress, Singer, Songwriter, Dancer, Commander, Diplomat, Lover, Noble, Courtier.<br/><br/>Constantine<br/>\u2022 Statesman of Amber<br/>\u2022 Contacts in City Amber &amp; The Golden Circle Kingdoms<br/>\u2022 Veteran of the Great Insurrection<br/>\u2022 Battlefield Secret (Killed the Heir of House Chantris)<br/>\u2022 Bastard With Something to Prove<br/>\u2022 Servant of Amber / Obeisant Son<br/>\u2022 Neglected General of Shadow<br/>\u2022 Swordsman of the Old Style<br/>\u2022 Student of the Pattern<br/>\u2022 Ally of Cassandra<br/>\u2022 Skills: Commander, Noble, Cavalier, Soldier, Scholar.<br/><br/>Note:  In Lucilla's aspects above Orlando is her New Wave Dandy meets Bishonin duellist brother, and Nicodemus is a Vulcan/Smith style character who has a conscience about the ways the objects he makes are used. He's strong and silent while Orlando is talkative but bores easily.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374597/#Comment_374597" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-26T15:12:06+00:00" title="April 26, 2012  3:12PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really enjoyed the Amber novels so I want to contribute--even though my memory of the books is not great.  I was rereading the books last year and had totally forgotten that Corwin had been blinded!  In any case, I can think of a few bangs based on the Aspects you've listed. <br/>Constantine:  <br/>--Battlefield Secret (Killed the Heir of House Chantris):  1) Constantine meets an ally that is investigating the Heir's death in order to bring the killer to justice. 2) Constantine sees the Heir, alive!  (Perhaps a twin or a shadow).<br/>--Bastard With Something to Prove:  1) A legitimate heir--or a humiliated spouse--wants to eliminate the Bastard as a stain on the family's honor; 2) A bastard with even more to prove wants to eliminate his rival; 3) Information reveals that all of Constantine's male siblings are equally illegitimate--meaning any single surviving sibling claims all wealth and possessions of the family patriarch.<br/><br/>The contacts, servant, statesman, and ally Aspects all could lead to an appeal for aid from any of the relevant parties.  <br/><br/>As I think of more, I'll post again, if this is the type of things you're looking for.  Nothing earth shattering, to be sure!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374608">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kropotkin" title="Kropotkin"><img alt="Kropotkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kropotkin">Kropotkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374608/#Comment_374608" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-26T16:31:53+00:00" title="April 26, 2012  4:31PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Those are some great suggestions for Constantine.

I've drawn in some things from the Amber diceless roleplaying as well.  This lets me have a nice baseline for how the powers work.  I've also tied the powers entirely to their attributes as in Amber Diceless.  I also gave them 10 aspects (and 10 Fate points) as in SoTC as opposed to Wheel of Fate's starting five aspects.  This helps reflect the age and power of the characters.  Although I've called them Skills--I'm using the Pools from Wheel of Fate.  They're basically broad areas of skill such as Cavalier, Courtier, Noble, Scholar, Sailor etc.  I'm not using stunts as I've gone in a more rules light direction for this campaign.  <br/><br/>I'm running the game (as this thread might suggest) by just preparing a bunch of bangs pointed at the PCs.  Its funny but this is in many ways a further extension of how I always used to run Amber.  Now though I have a way to talk about what I'm doing.<br/><br/> I have to say that I haven't seen my players this committed to a group of PCs--maybe ever.  We're three sessions in and things are churning along quite nicely.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
