Skipping one's chores and thereby causing problems for (others and) oneself is something the character does, and so has no bearing on the principle for me. The question is who came up with the thought "If Holmfridur doesn't harvest, everyone will go hungry". If that was the same player, and that same player then has to think up the solution, the the principle is broken, but if it's rules or a gamemaster then the player just makes a choice within the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nSummary: key words in the principle (the way I read it) are 'player' and 'devise'. Especially how it doesn't say 'character' and 'cause' (in-game 'cause' as opposed to ou-of-game 'devise').                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_301699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pete" title="Pete"><img alt="Pete" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pete">Pete</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301699/#Comment_301699" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-22T01:48:13+00:00" title="November 22, 2010  1:48AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zac in Davis</cite>Apparently it's pronounced "se-gah", by the way.</blockquote>\nFor realz?<br><br>Dang, I've been pronouncing it "chegg" + "eeeee" since I heard an American dude pronounce it thus on some or other podcast.

The resolution aspect is the lesser part of that principle.<br/><br/>It happened recently in Apocalypse World, and while playtesting Chronicles of Skin. In AW, we were at a con, it was an 8 hour slot (with a four hour break inbetween the two slots we were using) and while the game was fun, I'd already as a player narrated in the main adversary - a rival hardholder - and the reasons for his aggression, and bwah, it was just... unsatisfying.<br/><br/>The GM ran with the adversity I provided - maybe I was wrong to do that, but it was a one shot and we were colouring in the world - and provided lots of other adversity all of his own making, but yeah, that aspect was hella unsatisfying.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zac in Davis</cite>How does it jive with the Principle if a player chooses to either a) do his chores or b) be responsible for a related shortage all players must suffer?

That means we're fine, then - every season of play, profession X (ha, that's like <i>Professor </i>X) is in charge of preventing shortages in Y and Z. You can either flip the bird to your fellow dwarfs, or you can try to get your work done. You may still fail - or be forced to choose between getting it done and spending time with the people you care about - but you have to try at all to have a chance. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Pete</cite>If I "chose" the results of the dice - "I've decided to roll 12 on this" - yeah, that'd harsh my balls.</blockquote> In a previous version of the game, I gave players some meta-points to change die results, and let them change results up <i>or</i> down. The idea was to prevent critical success, which has some additional fallout (it attracts attention to the fortress), but what it led to was the question of bidding wars, and whether players could a) sabotage each other mechanically, which was a-thematic, and b) make themselves have critical failures, for which I then supplied details, lest things get too blech.<br/>[<i>edit</i>] Now, though, you can only improve your results, and no messing with other people's die results at all, though I may devise some manner of mechanizing teamwork. Doubtful, but maybe. <br/><br/>Steve, question for ya: how did you "have" the barmaid shoot your character in the back? How did the mechanics help make that happen?<br/><br/>Overall, folks, thanks for the clarity! I feel pretty confident that this design I've got going steers clear of the problem outlined by the Principle, but feel free to further reflect on what I've said here; i.e. we can keep the thread going.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_301731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301731/#Comment_301731" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-22T09:14:04+00:00" title="November 22, 2010  9:14AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GB Steve</cite>I'm not sure the principle holds across all situations.

I've played many games that were less character focused where we both devised and resolved our own adversity and it worked well. Especially using scene framing.
