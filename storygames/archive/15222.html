I'll be spending a little bit of time with them, but also travelling around a bit. My provisional travel plans are:<br/><br/>- moving between New York, Boston and Chicago (with the possibility of heading down to Florida)<br/>- I'll probably spend a month and a half in the States, sometime between March to June 2012<br/><br/>It would be cool to get some gaming in while I'm over there, and I was wondering if anyone could give me a general sense of what's happening around that part of the country during those times. The Story Games calendar doesn't have events posted for that far ahead yet. I'm interested in cons, mini-cons, and the legendary Beach Parties and Camp Nerdlys I've been reading about.<br/><br/>I know there's <a href="http://nerdnyc.com/wordpress/" rel="nofollow">NerdNYC</a>, and possibly Recess during that time.<br/><br/>I think there's a <a href="http://www.sgboston.com/" rel="nofollow">Story Games Boston group</a>, but I don't know how active they are.<br/><br/>Maybe there'll be a <a href="http://jiffycon.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">Jiffycon</a>.<br/><br/>I don't know what the story gaming situation is like in Chicago (although I think there's a regular meetup at the <a href="http://www.chicagolandgames.com/" rel="nofollow">Dice Dojo</a>).<br/><br/><hr/><br/>Thanks for any info you can give me - I have to make a decision about this in the next 48 hours and it's pretty exciting!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_346027">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346027/#Comment_346027" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-14T20:53:44+00:00" title="October 14, 2011  8:53PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Origins Game Fair is May 30th - June 3rd, in Columbus, Ohio.
