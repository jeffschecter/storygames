That's a lot of specialized people working together! Edit: And apparently they may be making close to $100 million in revenue this year.<br/><br/>The interview is with their VP of business development which is probably why the focus is more on business.<br/><br/>I know a lot of people who play Farmville. And they love it. They mention how people's children are managing their parent's farms. It's definitely true. My friends 5 year old excels at it. It scratches the same itch that Sims provided for many people. In fact most of my friends who play are the same ones who used to play Sims and stopped gaming since (outside of cell phone games).<br/><br/>I find these quotes interesting:<br/><br/>"I think the days of the indie developer are beyond us."<br/><br/>"We've actually made investments into some innovative games that were incredibly hardcore. If you look at Guild of Heroes, for example, we did roll that out. It was a version of Diablo built in Flash, and it wasn't successful, and we didn't support it any longer."<br/><br/>"The truth of the matter is that we kind of did, and were mindful of it, and we tried to build specifically for that casual, social platform."<br/><br/>That said, indie developer can definitely break ground in these spaces just enough to show the potential of an idea without having to go all the way through production, marketing, sales, maintenance, and customer support. Looking at their job descriptions for game designers, they ask for people who have experience testing ideas in Excel first before going into full development. That's incredibly smart.</blockquote>\nAnd, sadly, I am not so impressed with how some (Zynga included) play ball, after reading this:<br/><a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/10/31/scamville-the-social-gaming-ecosystem-of-hell/" rel="nofollow">Scamville: The Social Gaming Ecosystem Of Hell</a><br/>basic argument, for the TL/DR folks: "Game developers who monetize the best (and that\u2019s Zynga) make the most money and can spend the most on advertising. Those that won\u2019t touch this stuff (Slide and others) fall further and further behind. Other game developers have to either get in on the monetization or fall behind as well. Companies like Playdom and Playfish seem to be struggling with their conscience and are constantly shifting their policies on lead gen."<br/><br/>As someone who knows better than to take an "offer," I'm not surprised.

Thanks for spinning this off (and linking the Scamville article).<br/><br/>I'm not a fan of Zynga's game. They make me seethe with boredom. That said, Zynga\u2019s very clever at what they do. If they're as smart as they seem to be, I'm guessing they'll realize that scambait is a dead-end business model and keep refining their approach into a real sustainable model for success. Even without the lead-generation scams, there look to be some pretty compelling revenue models for casual online gaming. Advertising revenue and real cash for in-game loot both look encouraging.<br/><br/>But this Zynga interview paints a picture of an industry that's more excited by its prospects for revenue than the games it's making. That's not a bad thing. What they're doing <i>is </i>pretty damn exciting from a business perspective. But it's also a recipe for disaster for the indie developer. Zynga's approach is all about making games more addictive. As a creative path, that leads eventually to a dead end.<br/><br/>My takeaway from the casual games industry is that when people start waving cash around it's doubly important to focus on your goals and stay true to your conscience. As an indie designer, I think I'd probably be better off creating a little viral Facebook game that breaks some of the rules and makes me a few grand than dreaming of $100 million payouts. <br/><br/>So study these guys, learn from them, and then use your creative juice to make something completely new of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_240473">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240473/#Comment_240473" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-04T13:01:46+00:00" title="November  4, 2009  1:01PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was shocked that 1/3 of Zynga's revenue come from those scam offers.

This system seems fine to me. It's similar to Hulu. Instead of paying iTunes $2 to watch a TV episode, I can go to Hulu and watch a few commercials.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is, some of these advertisers are scamming users. I have no idea what percentage is doing this. 2 specifically were named. <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2009/10/30/consumer-texting-scam.html" rel="nofollow">This seems to be one of the primary culprits.</a><br/>\n<br/>\nYou take a quiz in exchange for game points. Enter your cell phone number to receive the results via text. And you end up paying a monthly subscription fee to a service you never signed up for.

They will thrive as consumers flock to products that better suit their desires.  And then their own success will be their undoing as those with scale move in to do the same thing bigger and cheaper.  They will then shrink until the next cycle.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose few that survive the indie-bust part of the cycle to seed the next indie-boom I think will be those who employ "throw the spaghetti at the wall to see what sticks" strategies of trying things no mainstreamer would waste time on.  Their efforts essentially become "proof of concept" endeavors for larger producers and they'll do best to have a business model that capitalizes on the success they find before they get squeezed out.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I suspect...quick hits and move on, rather than attempting to build an extended tail or subscription type revenue stream.  If their business model requires achieving an economy of scale to work, they better be able to do it before someone who already has a machine in place to build scale passes them by.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_240530">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240530/#Comment_240530" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-04T20:39:34+00:00" title="November  4, 2009  8:39PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All those idiots on AOL that we used to make fun of on Usenet didn't go away, and they certainly didn't get any smarter.
