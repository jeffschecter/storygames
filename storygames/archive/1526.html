                    I was going to write a review of this Rev Eng entry, but I didn't get round to it. Besides, this might start a discussion with Mark, who wrote the game, and I didn't want to clog up the main review thread with it.<br/><br/>So, I read through the game, and the concept was totally fantastic: the best I read in this competition. I love the idea of the vengeful clock and the switch, halfway through the game, where it becomes nightmarish.<br/><br/>Mark, could I ask some questions about it? As I understand it, before the nightmare stage, there's six attacks. In each attack, a scene is set, and the guests describe some actions; then the attack takes place and there might or might not be an Admission.<br/><br/>Firstly, it seems very short. There's only six attacks and they seem, pretty much, to be a mechanical thing. Is the expectation that setting the scene will take a while, with the guests describing what they're doing, in a sort of free play thing?<br/><br/>Secondly, it seems unevenly divided. If there's four players, two players will get one scene, while the other two will get two scenes. Is that right?<br/><br/>I'm not sure about the admissions. There's only one or two of them per player. I worry that it just lead to a couple of "revelations" about each character: for example, they poisoned their wife, they've always hated the way they look. It's OK, but I'm not sure it'll really build into a story: particularly as we only get one admission from each character before moving on to the next and there's only six in total. Have I misunderstood something?<br/><br/>I also had a thought about the end section. You say that the first character's punishment is the worst; the second's is slightly less bad; and so on. It seems to take the tension down, rather than up. <br/><br/>How would feel about switching it round: so the first character gets a nasty punishment, but then the next one is even worse, until the last punishment is indescribably hellish? Then there's one character left, who gets away unharmed.<br/><br/>Anyway, good luck with the game: it's a superb premise.<br/><br/>Graham                </div>

                            Graham,<br/><br/>Thank you for your kind words and your interest in the design!<br/><br/>In your polite manner, you have hit all the places where I think the design is weak. On to your questions:<br/><br/>1) I think the game will play quickly in practice, and as written I think it will play out very much like a casual card game instead of a "true" role-playing game. My design path focussed on the endgame, mechanics for getting there, and then I sort of handwaved the in-between stuff. Fred Hicks noted this in his review as well. The game is rather "flat" right now, and could use some way of putting a direction to the "free play" portions.<br/><br/>2) Yes, it is unevenly divided. But there are auctions for the rights to attack, so the players getting the extra attacks will have to pay for them with cards.<br/><br/>3) I think you've nailed the way the admissions will probably play out. The game is going to be short as presently written. I had initially thought that maybe the game could actually be played on the clock, and that it would take an hour to play. I left myself with no playtesting time, so I didn't know whether that would work.<br/><br/>4) Your idea for the end section is so obviously right I have nothing to add. Brilliant.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I think the game will be an orphan for a while, since I have plenty on my plate in Real Life as well as a separate WIP to give some love to. Thanks again for commenting on it!                        </div>
