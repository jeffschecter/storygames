Most of the games I've run of Perfect have been one-shot convention games. I wonder how much play Perfect gets that stretches beyond a single session.<br/><br/>Have you ever played a game of Perfect that stretched across multiple sessions? How did it go? Did it lose steam between sessions? Did characters become mechanically unbalanced through Payouts? Did you see character growth in the longer term?<br/><br/>I'm interested to hear.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
