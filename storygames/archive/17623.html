So even i i roleplay with another player and we come to a conclusion i can still say i get shot (black die) at the end of the scene.<br/>When Carl resolves for me, i can decide to dice but he still has 100% rights to do whatever he wants with my character, is this correct? <br/><br/>In short, i establishing i get full control (besides other people roleplaying) and i resolve i have no input besides my roleplaying and the color of the die!?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399273/#Comment_399273" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-30T16:23:30+00:00" title="November 30, 2012  4:23PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 30, 2012 4:27PM by Nathan_H.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When you establish a scene, you're starting it; choosing where it takes place, what it's about, and who's in it... usually.  You describe toward something that is oftentimes rife with conflict(but not always).  You're setting the scene.  Directing it and acting for your character.  When it becomes likely that the scene's coming to a head, another player hands you a die, and takes over describing the outcome, either positive or negative.<br/><br/>When you to chose to resolve a scene, the other players set the scene and jerk your character into conflict.  You get to choose and describe the outcome of the conflict.<br/><br/>I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_399277">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399277/#Comment_399277" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-30T16:46:07+00:00" title="November 30, 2012  4:46PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 30, 2012 5:03PM by Steve_Segedy.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, Nathan's got it. You never have complete control over any scene. You can either choose how it begins or how it ends, and even then, collaborating with the other players is always going to be better. <br/><br/>Usually when you establish you're not going to start out by saying "and I'm getting shot at the end of this scene" but if that's what you want from the story, say that and talk it over with the other players. Then you can determine whether you're establishing or actually resolving.<br/><br/>You can also have the same outcome mean different things depending on the die and the situation- getting shot sounds bad for your character (black die) but what if taking the bullet is the only way to save someone precious, and that's exactly what he wants? Sounds like that scene went well for him (white die).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo" title="w00hoo"><img alt="w00hoo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/395/nB2PXS15U6BFQ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo">w00hoo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399293/#Comment_399293" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-30T23:44:15+00:00" title="November 30, 2012 11:44PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>When it becomes likely that the scene's coming to a head, another player hands you a die, and takes over describing the outcome, either positive or negative.</blockquote>\nI'm not sure if it's 'as written' but I've always left the description of the outcome to the player who is handed the die, but they have to angle it in the direction (positive or negative for their character) that the die colour decrees.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_399844">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399844/#Comment_399844" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-06T13:35:13+00:00" title="December  6, 2012  1:35PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've seen both ways. Quite often, it's the other PC in the scene's player who pulls the die and then pushes hard, in dialog or narration. (I've never seen a solo scene, which would probably necessitate the sort of 'full narrative takeover' that Nathan describes.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
