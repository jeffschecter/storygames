All known spells follow it.<br/><br/>First, you name who established the spell. For some spells, everything about them but their name is lost in the shrouds of history. As long as people cast the spell, however, their name will be remembered.<br/><br/>Second, you name the price they paid to establish the spell. This is often one or more persons.<br/><br/>Third, you say what the spell does.<br/><br/>If you perform those steps at the right time, it always work. You don't have to pay the price; that was for creating the spell and leaving it open for anyone to cast.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The right time is often very limiting. Many spells only work on a particular date each year. The more useful ones depend on the phases of the moon, e.g. can be used each full moon. I've heard of one that could be used any wednesday. It's probably not that strong, though.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435209/#Comment_435209" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-13T21:52:53+00:00" title="July 13, 2014  9:52PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Example spells:<br/><br/>John Kerr, the 5th Earl of Roxburgh, established a contract for which he paid the life of his friend William Baker.

I invoke it to make this item invisible to anyone not present now, and remain so for a day and a night.<br/>(This spell can be used at night, under a starry sky on which Ursa Major can be seen.)<br/><br/>Miss Edith MIller established a contract for which she paid four toes on her right foot. I invoke it now to make my husband die, seemingly from natural causes, within a month.<br/>(This spell can only be used during your honeymoon.)<br/><br/>Silvia Svensson, Swedish magician, established a contract for which she paid the life of archivist Jan Karlsson. I invoke it to find what i'm searching for in this archive, provided it exists, within a minute.<br/>(This spell was created to honour Jan, on his request. He was already dying, and wanted his death to be useful so he asked his friend Silvia to use it as payment for a contract. It can only be used on friday afternoons, since that's when he usually did the last archive sorting of the week.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435211">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435211/#Comment_435211" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-13T22:50:16+00:00" title="July 13, 2014 10:50PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very interesting, adds a touch of verisimilitude (contracts with spirits are part of certain ceremonial schools) as well as unique "personality" and history to each spell.  So tell me: Can PCs make new contracts?  With whom are these contracts made?  Demons?  Deities?  These entities determine whether or not a contract can be executed in the first place?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435212">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435212/#Comment_435212" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-13T22:57:09+00:00" title="July 13, 2014 10:57PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wasn't planning on deciding what's canon for that just yet :P<br/><br/>But yeah, there is a way to actively seek out someone to make a new contract. If you have a specific spell you need to cast, the price will probably feel unfair though. After all, you pay for anyone to be able to use it at the specified times forever and ever. If you only need to use it once, that's your problem. So with three thousand years of magical history to dig into, it might be more worthwhile to find a pact someone else made for the same thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435225">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435225/#Comment_435225" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-14T12:32:02+00:00" title="July 14, 2014 12:32PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I forgot to state the purpose of the tread!<br/><br/>Help me brainstorm spells to use for this system!
