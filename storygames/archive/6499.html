Specifically, I'd like to know what the highlights of the weekend were for you, not in a game, but in general. Was a particular part of the organization great? How about a particular meal, or the way games were planned?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, any concerns you had afterwards would be appreciated, although I'd really prefer that you mention joys as well. If you had no joys, I am sorry! That is probably a good data point to know.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143866">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143866/#Comment_143866" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-14T05:06:24+00:00" title="May 14, 2008  5:06AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's my biggest joy: the food.

It was better than I'd get at most restaurants, and it was homemade and tasted like good camp food should.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy only concern: I hope that Nerdly's a few weeks later next year. It was pretty cold out, and I found it hard to concentrate on Friday night and Saturday morning from being so chilly. I didn't pack right, though, so that may be on me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143869">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers" title="James Jeffers"><img alt="James Jeffers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers">James Jeffers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143869/#Comment_143869" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-14T05:30:53+00:00" title="May 14, 2008  5:30AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joys:<br/>The Hummus.<br/><br/>Mess Hall filled with happy people playing neat games Saturday night.<br/><br/>Sacking Dol Amroth.<br/><br/>Concerns:<br/>No Nerdly Group Photo this year! What's up with that?<br/><br/>No talent show, which made me sad.<br/><br/>Scheduling: not on Mother's Day, if at all possible.<br/><br/>Bathrooms: a bathroom no-shoes protocol. Have folks leave their shows outside the bathrooms, which are nearly always pretty damned damp, and use shower shoes/flip flops/whatever. I noticed that as soon as people mopped the bathroom floors, the very next person to come in from the muddy outside would track dirt all over. So, create a specific platform (like a large rock, or a small mat) for people to place their "outside" shoes on, and then they can use their shower shoes for inside the bathroom. Just a thought. <br/><br/>Fires: the wood was way too damp to be useful. Of course, if it wasn't so cold, maybe that would be a non-problem. But I like cold. And fire.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143871">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143871/#Comment_143871" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-14T05:37:11+00:00" title="May 14, 2008  5:37AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was really happy with all aspects of Nerdly.

I believe there's a trade-off, though, as demand for the camp grows as the weather improves and cold is replaced by bugs and heat.  I'm not sure there's a really great solution.  Maybe a few weeks would make a big difference.  I know Mother's Day interfered with some people's ability to attend, too.<br/><br/>There were no children there this year and it was fantastic.  I don't hate children or anything, and I know the organization of the event is not entirely family-friendly, but many people commented on the positive aspects of an adults only event.  If it were up to me, which it isn't, I'd just say "no kids".  <br/><br/>Props to everyone who did their chores with such zeal.  Some people didn't make it, so their chores needed to be covered too, which lots of people stepped up to handle without complaint.  This is the true Owlbear Spirit.<br/><br/>The loosey-goosey scheduling of games seemed to work well.  It helped that Eric was organized as hell and brought all the wiki documents.<br/><br/>I missed the talent show and group photo (because they didn't happen!  Swap meet, too).  The solution for this is to aggressively court volunteers to organize and run these things.  <br/><br/>We need some kind of activity that gets every camper meeting every other camper.  <br/><br/>The food was amazing and worth the extra expense, which wasn't as much as we thought.  I'd definitely do this again.  Having a dedicated boss of the kitchen who is also a talented chef was a really good idea.  After seeing how Derek managed the kitchen, I'm amazed we all didn't get intestinal parasites last year.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143879/#Comment_143879" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-14T05:50:53+00:00" title="May 14, 2008  5:50AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>We need some kind of activity that gets every camper meeting every other camper.</blockquote>\nThis would be good.

I never felt hungry, or that my vegheadedness was an issue.  Cookies during Saturday night's game rocked.<br/><br/>And it was great to see everyone pitching in on the chores.<br/><br/>I too think that we need something that gets everyone meeting everyone else.  I watched Jason's Upgrade video and realized that I didn't know most of the folks involved.  Or if I did, I hadn't really talked to them or played anything with them during the weekend.  I know there is only so much time, but I worry about that.<br/><br/>I said last year and I'll say again, I think we need a more formal muster announcement for the start of game sessions.  If not someone announcing the games and where they are being played, then at least a poster of who/what/where/slots available.  We had posters of the games for each slot, and who was running them, but no way to know where they were, or if there we're openings.<br/><br/>I'd also suggest setting aside a table as a meeting place for folks who don't have a game, but want to play something in that slot.  Saturday afternoon I had nothing, and it was really hard to tell what was going on at each table in the mess hall, and if folks were playing something, just hanging out talking, or also looking to get a pickup game together.  The board games table solved that for board game interest, since folks would naturally congregate to the game table, but we really need something for folks looking for roleplaying.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143899/#Comment_143899" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-14T06:50:50+00:00" title="May 14, 2008  6:50AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Was there a suggestion box this year?

Not a big one, but I thought it was worth mentioning.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was no skim milk, only full fat and half and half.  There was no diet soda, and the chips were all full fat, no baked or light, or even pretzels.  <br/>\nAlso the grilled sandwiches for lunch seemed a disappointment, as the outside was perfect and the inside was cold and cheese did not melt.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, I was prepared for most of this.  I brought my own snacks (and shared, as the Mythos Hunter Zero crowd Saturday night can attest), and my own soda.  And grilled sandwiches on a flat top of that size can be a beast for even a pro.  So really, like I said, tiny little issues that did not have an adverse affect on my awesome experience, nor does it in anyway make me think we shouldn't be on our knees asking Derek and family back to guide us next year.  I've been a restaurant manager before and anyone who can run a kitchen for five meals straight and cleanup, without burning down the hall and locking us all inside (which is why I\u2019m not still a restaurant manager) is a g-d and we would be lucky to have him back next year.  Derek is the man.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as things I liked, non game wise?  The fact that none of you has yet mentioned the cobbler makes you all heathens as it was the greatest thing to slide down my gullet all weekend.  The people, and their attitudes were fantastic.  I had great conversations with people I didn't get a chance to game with.  Meal time I tried my best to sit down with someone I didn't know who was sitting by themselves and start a conversation.  I always felt welcome at every table.  The planning wiki was fantastic and I hope we do as much or more planning with it next year.  I could plan my chores based on games I already knew I was signed up for.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I agree with everyone that more communal activities should take place.  I must admit to wussing out and not planning a camp wide "rock paper scissors" style game. Next year, next year...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe weather was fine.  I'd prefer that it not be on mother's day weekend, but it can't be on memorial day weekend unless we book a year in advance, and any later than that and we'd all be dealing with bug bites.  Next year I'm bringing my mummy bag instead of my summer bag, and thicker socks.  No big deal.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe chores went smoother than I thought possible.  I was playing a little Zendo on Sunday morning.  We all wrapped up and started looking for cleanup assignments, and I felt like a whirlwind of cleaning had passed me by.  Kudos to all on the cleaning.  Also, I gots to mention that Eric dipped out of his Saturday night game for 15 minutes or so to deal with what had to be a truly gross task of resorting the trash.  The recycling and trash bins were confused by many people (myself included) from Friday night through Saturday night and Eric just went out with the Saturday night trash detail folks and dealt with it.  Eric got a lot of things right this weekend, but that one moment of "whoops, problem, I'll be right back, gotta deal with this" gave me all the proof I need that Eric is one hell of an Owlbear.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan't wait for next year.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143954">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143954/#Comment_143954" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-14T09:57:32+00:00" title="May 14, 2008  9:57AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would rather be cold than hot.

Maybe I'll try to make some of this happen. Actually, much of my feedback is simply stating how awesome others' ideas are:<br/><br/>1) I forgot to rev up the Camp Nerdly Mailing List again, which is a much better tool for last-minute organization, interest pools and the like, as well as feedback. I'll try to make sure it happens next year.  In the interim, if you want to join...<br/><a href="http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/campnerdly" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/campnerdly</a><br/><br/>2) Mark's idea about Polaroids rocks. Or if not that, then maybe we could try to have people send us a pic from within the last year or something to post beforehand. But honestly, there's a lot of faces in my head, people whose names I forget then and forget now, who I'd love to have been able to reference on such a thing discreetly.<br/><br/>3) Icebreaker. Yeah, that's a good one, too. We actually started the year off with a giant game of Apples to Apples, with the intention of keeping it going onand one, with new people coming in, others dropping out. Problem was that the first day, everyone was kinda busy with setup, so it was hard o round people up... and AtA can actually get boring after 2 big games in a row. :-) But yeah, a worthy idea.<br/><br/>4) Talent show: I could go either way on that, but I'd have no problem watching if someone else racked it up.<br/><br/>5) Group pic: Yeah, we're all kicking ourselves for forgetting that item, I bet. D'oh.<br/><br/>6) Table tents describing what will happen and where. Yeah. Same with a larger print-schedule or something.<br/>- Having said that, we rode the cusp: People who really wanted organization were able to organize and be happy. People who really wanted to just go with the flow were able to do so and be happy. There is probably more we can do to make sure both can continue to happen next year as well.<br/><br/>7) The mini-hike was fun. I might want to rack up another next year as well. Last-minuteness meant that Jeff got screwed when he ran to his cabin to put on his boots, and the rest of us assumed that he had something else to do (sorry man!).<br/><br/>8) Next year: I'd like to see a list of Things Folks Should Bring, just so that some folks can have a simple checklist and not forget something at the last minute. I forgot a coffee cup. And a good plate.<br/><br/>9) Fires are awesome.<br/><br/>10) I loved how we all threw our board games on a communal pile, for people to root through, pull out, rack up and play spontaneously. I saw several of my games make the rounds, and it made me feel good that others were having fun because of that.<br/><br/>11) I'm hoping there's a broad line between "late winter" and "early summer". I'm hoping that it's warmer next year, but will make sure to take precautions just in case it isn't. Also, most likely bugs aren't going to be a huge concern, considering most of the time we'll be in cabins and the like (with screens and all), but yeah hot, sticky East Coast Summer isn't very fun.<br/><br/>12) I'm wondering if there's more lead-up fun that can go down before the actual event? People organize, do "something", and bring that "something" to the camp, and share that "something" with others (dunno what "something" is: Might be a D&amp;D dungeon, a new homebrew RPG, an improv game, etc).<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144030">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144030/#Comment_144030" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-14T14:00:35+00:00" title="May 14, 2008  2:00PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, self feedback: I was thinking of doing a Yoga seminar or something, y'know, fun but not directly related to gaming. I'm glad I didn't though, because all that sweat would have probably turned the participants into reeking mungeballs at best, and at worst would have had 12 people racing for the showers afterwards.<br/><br/>But some non-strenuous physical or mental side-activities? I'd be up for seeing more of those. Life Drawing didn't work out this year it seems. There was plenty of knitting going down, for those that wanted it.<br/><br/>Ah, one more thing, a comment on icebreakers and meeting folks: So, what I did for myself every meal, is that I made sure to force myself to sit down with at least 1-2 new people that I've never met before. That was my own personal little rule: It may have looked like I was really extroverted and into meet-and-greet, but I'm actually quite introverted, and left to my own devices, would have spent every meal with my RTP crew. I wish that I shared it with others before the day, maybe some others might have forced themselves to do the same and mix it up more. Having said that, even as I moved from table to table, I saw in general that it wasn't clumps of people always sitting together, that others were mixing it up, too.<br/><br/>And man, I really enjoyed meeting new people. I didn't get to meet Everyone, or even hang out for a significant time with everyone, but I was happy with the nice fraction of the new people I did get to meet, and hang out with.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144051">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144051/#Comment_144051" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-14T15:07:26+00:00" title="May 14, 2008  3:07PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I would rather be cold than hot.

I even tried to weasel my way into cleanups on saturday morning. Too bad the cleanup crew was so effective. Side note 10 lbs of bacon makes a lot of grease.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoy... Games were a lot of fun. Maybe we can make this thing a day longer next year or something. :D<br/>\n<br/>\nConcern... <br/>\nWe got the food shopping list lateish and a lot of our food snafus could have been avoided if we had got it sooner, or had a local place to store stuff. Milk for example had to be got on friday and I made a deliberate choice to not get skim because I had a set budget and just me to shop in the afternoon. I regret not having soymilk. I really really like soymilk too. Next year we should buy a lot of stuff early or hire a food service company like SYSCO to deliver it just before we go. It'll cost a bit more, but we will have the added advantage of bulk purchasing power and better control over food items.  <br/>\n<br/>\nConcern... more snacks!!! Cookies were good, and we had lots of fruit, but I would have killed for something more hearty at 11 pm I dont know what, but it would have been rockin.<br/>\n<br/>\nConcern... Coffee, one 12 cup coffee pot does not work for 55 people, if twenty or more of them drink coffee. The tea hot pot worked great, but I suggest we look into getting a coffee urn or have more people bring coffee pots to Nerdly. Alternately we start a Nerdlybucks coffee bar and serve espresso drinks and iced coffees and staff it occasionally with coffee obsessed geeks like me. What we did have that makes this a mixed concern is a lot of whole bean coffee which rocked, and Nerdlyites willing to make a fresh pot. Still watching us wait for the next pot to brew was like watching a methadone clinic waiting to open.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso not entirely a concern or a joy but I totally didn't pack for the weather when it came to sleeping and though I was mostly comfortable there were a couple of cold moments.<br/>\nI realise that dry Firewood would eliminate much of the concern on that front, because both the Castle and Mess Hall would have been pretty toasty.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144071/#Comment_144071" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-14T18:52:14+00:00" title="May 14, 2008  6:52PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and I don't remember that any of the sodas were actually brought by Nerdly staff or Derek for that matter.

I think it would have been a warmer weekend if we had gathered loose wood on Friday before the rain started that evening.  <br/><br/>I think that some type of icebreaker would be great--nay, essential.  Maybe something related to the badge--like finding out what everyone's super power was or something.  We were a small enough group that it should be possible to exchange a few words with everyone.  I plan to think about this a lot, and try to come up with something good.  I'm like Andy in that if left to my own devices, I won't seek out too many people that I don't know.

I also try to avoid eating with Andy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144135">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Maddrjeffe" title="Maddrjeffe"><img alt="Maddrjeffe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Maddrjeffe">Maddrjeffe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144135/#Comment_144135" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-15T06:52:42+00:00" title="May 15, 2008  6:52AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 15, 2008 6:59AM by Maddrjeffe.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            yeah, he smelled funny, who would want to eat with him...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n...just kidding!<br/>\n<br/>\nA badge game might be fun,...or it could be like a collectable card game where you need to collect peoples cards to win/ play.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't know that might involve making an insane amount of cards, but if you had to go to everyone to collect a full deck that would be awesome.

Sometimes, that's the way it works.
