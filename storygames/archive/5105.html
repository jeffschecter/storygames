Especially the siege of Messolonghi. <br/> ''Messolonghi revolted against the Turks on May 20 1821 and was a major stronghold of the Greek rebels in the Greek War of Independence. Its inhabitants successfully resisted a siege by Ottoman forces in 1822. The second siege started on April 15, 1825 by Kioutachis whose army numbered 30,000 men and was later reinforced by another 10,000 men led by Ibrahim Pasha, son of Muhammad Ali Pasha of Egypt. After a year of relentless enemy attacks and facing starvation, the people of Mesolonghi decided to leave the beleaguered city in the "Exodus of its Guards" (The Sorty) on the night of April 10, 1826. At the time, there were 10,500 people in Messolonghi 3,500 of which were armed. Very few people survived the Ottoman pincer movement after the betrayal of their plan.<br/><br/>Due to the heroic stance of the population and the subsequent massacre of its inhabitants by the Turkish-Egyptian forces, that followed, the town of Mesolonghi received the honorary title of Hiera Polis (the Sacred City), unique among other Greek cities.''<br/><br/>The wikipedia entry is pretty blah, but this is one of the most inspiring stories in Greek history. In the end, those with weapons decided to make an exit against an army that outnumbered them 10 to 1, instead of surrendering. They had previously eaten every cat and dog in the city.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_116009">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tomg" title="tomg"><img alt="tomg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://tomgurg.googlepages.com/tinyrobot1.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tomg">tomg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116009/#Comment_116009" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-22T07:22:46+00:00" title="December 22, 2007  7:22AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm in for the Texas War for Independence.  it is a David and Goliath type story with some excellent generals.  <br/>\nI don't believe anyone mentioned the War of 1812.

I think I just figured out the title.<br/><br/>The Spanish Civil War resonates with me greatly; I'd have to be careful if playing within that to not take its events lightly. I only recently finished <i>Persepolis</i> (given to me by best gf ever), so the Iraq-Iran war and/or Iranian Revolution might be fascinating. Even more so with that one, I'd need to more research to make sure I knew what the hell I was doing.<br/><br/>American Revolutionary War: I feel like I know almost nearly enough to play that, and it'd be sweet to have Jefferson punch Hamilton in the face or something. But that might drift myself into <i>Sons of Liberty</i> territory.<br/><br/>EDIT: Okay, more on *why* those are interesting. The Spain + Iran: for similar reasons. Both were tied up with ideals about what a government should do and what a culture should be like, while mixed in with the realities of how the culture was / what government did do / what people would do to each other when society broke down. Some of the ideals I saw broken in each of those conflicts are ones I feel close to or sympathetic too. Some of the defeats on those conflicts came from emerging dysfunctions and failures in which ways those factions tried to conduct their people or their fighting; not quite inevitability, but doom my means of previous bad choices. Certainly though: this comes from a very biased, one-sided reading of both these conflicts. It may mean I'm not quite fit to get into this.<br/><br/>The Revolutionary War: it ain't a perfect or just war exactly, but I can mostly feel good about it, and it's nice to be doing that wish a slice of American History when you can.

Thanks, guys.  This feedback is awesome.</p>\n<p>Dev,<br/>\nI noticed that you edited your post.  I'm not sure whether or not that was after my previous reply to you.  Since I don't seem to remember the stuff below the edit mark, I'm assuming that stuff is new to me.  So, you've totally sold me on Spanish Civil.  Like, I was already sold, but now I'm planning on finding the fucking Spanish Civil war <em>on sale</em> during boxing week, and I'm re-staging it in my house.  That's awfully glib of me, I know, but that's a hint of how enthused I am to game that sucker.  In fact, the more I reflect on what you wrote, the more I realize that I want to game it with you.  You don't happen to live next door to me in wintry Ottawa, do you?</p>\n<p>And your penultimate comment -- the one where you say that due to a one-sided approach you may not be "...quite fit to get into this." needs a little explanation.  What about having a strong one-sided opinion makes you ineligible?  I'm confused.</p>\n<p>Selene,<br/>\nI don't know if you're a <em>Firefly</em> fan, but I'm hoping that you are.  That look that Mal makes when he first opens River's cryo-unit.  That's the look I'm making right now.</p>\n<p>Hunh.</p>\n<p>This is one of those moments when you say "figures".  It had never occurred to me that there was American-Phillipine history that predated WWII.  That's pretty near-sighted, I know, but I figured that it was worth putting out in the open.  One of the downfalls of my Canadian-no-social-studies-past-Grade-10-education is that we didn't cover anything outside of European and North-American history.  So, this is a huge learning experience for me (which is good).  Wow, so the Yanks were essentially opportunistic occupiers of the Phillipines?  Who sort of (but mostly not) redeemed themselves, kind of, if you squint the right way, during WWII?  Jinkies!</p>\n<p>Oh, the other thing that's neat about your post is the bit about Carnegie et al.  There's a mechanic in Black Caddies that could totally rock out with that kind of background; it empowers the players to tell what amounts to war stories about the fiction that they just gamed.  Put those stories in a anti-war situation back home, and they'd be extra-grabby.</p>\n<p>Daniel,<br/>\nUpon doing some digging (pardon the pun, it isn't intentional) into the Battle of the Crater, I'm struck by a very vibrant parallel with WWI; namely, the recurring theme of pointless bloodshed to a) assuage some general's bruised ego or b) pander to some idiotic notion (oh, let's not use the properly trained troops, there may be political repercussions!).</p>\n<p>I think that my revulsion at this theme has a lot to do with the high mortality rate among NPC COs in my games...</p>\n<p>Mike,<br/>\nI'm absolutely interested in some more playtesting.  Whisper me here, and we'll talk further.  Thanks!</p>\n<p>Robert,<br/>\nYeah.

That makes a lot of sense, and I <em>think</em> that I've got your ass covered in that regard.  Here's why:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>let's assume that you're playing with 2-3 other folks, and that they don't hold socio-political views that are carbon copies of your own.  If you are in fact Jango Fett, and so are your mates, then you're probably screwed.</li>\n<li>Item: Although the system assigns stewardship over the protags to the players, it does not assign <em>ownership</em>.  This is hardly groudbreaking stuff in the land of indie rpgs, but it's critical.  There's no "my guy" going on.  It's strictly troupe play, and when the system assigns speaking rights to a given participant, they hold the mighty directorial power stick over everything.</li>\n<li>Narrative constraints are essentially twofold: 1) The "sniff test" - does it make sense given what's gone before?  2) There are thematic and win/lose constraints derived from the fortune-based resolution.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When those three points are couple with the fact that play essentially proceeds in a reasonable facsimile of "around the table", each given player is never in a position of privileged authorship long enough to run away with the evolving situation.  You're constantly responding to the last player, as well as to the system.  It's really, really hard to put "the overwhelming stamp of Dev" on the game.</p>\n<p>And the <em>really</em> cool part is that even if you do (stamp your opinion all over the game), there's a check and balance for that too.  But we can talk about that next if you like.  However, I'd like to pause here and give you a chance to respond.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_117096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Darcy%20Burgess" title="Darcy Burgess"><img alt="Darcy Burgess" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://home.ca.inter.net/~krunch/PBP/gc07/pics/icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Darcy%20Burgess">Darcy Burgess</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/117096/#Comment_117096" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-30T08:58:41+00:00" title="December 30, 2007  8:58AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 30, 2007 8:59AM by Darcy Burgess.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Clint,<br/>\nThanks for the <a href="http://www.chapters.indigo.ca/books/War-Stories-Garth-Ennis/9781401210397-item.html?ref=Search+Books%3a+%2527ennis%2527" rel="nofollow">Garth Ennis tip</a>.

Checks and balances?  Sure!</p>\n<p>In fact, this is the part of the game that excites me the most.  And what's important to note in the context of your question is that this mechanic isn't trotted out <em>as</em> a check/balance for the issue you've raised; rather, it happens regardless of what you're worried about.  It also happens to <em>act</em> as a check and balance for that kind of behaviour.</p>\n<p>At the end of each session, each particpant chooses one moment of the fiction that's just been roleplayed.  The important criteria here is that the moment moved or touched them <em>as a human being</em>.</p>\n<p>They then re-tell that moment in whatever format (I've seen letters home, after-action reports, photographs, etc) they choose.  In the re-telling, they are <strong>not</strong> allowed to simply regurgitate the moment; the moment must be changed in some way (the degree of change is at the discretion of the teller).</p>\n<p>In practice, this has provoked some wonderful moments of drama as well as some hard-handed commentary.  I guess that my question to you is, do you see how this could be used to also pull an errant player in-line?</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_117145">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tomg" title="tomg"><img alt="tomg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://tomgurg.googlepages.com/tinyrobot1.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tomg">tomg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/117145/#Comment_117145" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-30T18:58:52+00:00" title="December 30, 2007  6:58PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Darcy,<br/>\nHere are some Texas Revolution links.<br/>\nhttp://www.thc.state.tx.us/triviafun/trvdefault.html<br/>\nhttp://pw1.netcom.com/~wandaron/txhist.html<br/>\nhttp://www.lsjunction.com/events/events.htm<br/>\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Texas#Mexican_Texas<br/>\nHope this helps.
