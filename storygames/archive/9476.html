Anyway, I decided to go the convention and play a few games, but the D&amp;D games I played in weren't any fun. I had one good Call of Cthulu game that gave me some sense that there was fun to be had. Then, I ran into Paul Tevis and his description of Dogs blew my mind. Here was the kind of stuff I wanted games to be about. Then I ran into a group of folks that were into these games--talking about them and playing them, and designing them too. Jesse was in that group. <br/><br/>Anyway, I didn't really have a group, so there was no group I needed to convert.

And, for the record, I wasn't converted so much as I stopped roleplaying entirely, wrote a game from the ground up to address what I didn't like in my previous gaming, and found people to playtest that and design new stuff with.  In the process of designing my game, I came into contact with other indie games.  I played and I continue to play lots of different games, sifting through as many games as I can get my hands on to find new and interesting play experiences.  Recently, I participated in some "traditional" gaming, and I find it difficult to put my indie gaming and "traditional" gaming in the same category.  They're pretty profoundly different activities.<br/><br/>Which is to say \u2014 it's pretty probable that the guys you play with now don't want to play indie games any more than your baseball team would like to suddenly become a quilting circle.

For me there's the extra complication that game time is the only time I get to see some of these people.  It's rough!<br/><br/>As for the OP's question; what got me into indie games was always wanting to play story now, even back when I didn't know how to express it.  That combined with an interest in learning and adventurous spirit may not have made the transition easy for me, but at least it made it inevitable.  Turns out, though not everyone has this churning mass of yearning desire for something they've never had words to speak before.  What's up with that?<br/><br/>At least, that's the path I took from trad to indie gaming.

Resolving a whole conflict on a die-roll may seem unfun to people who like to get down into the nitty-gritty of the blow by blow. Is it that the games are physically smaller, so how could a decent game be put into such a small package when D&amp;D requires 2+ full-size (letter-size, 200-300 pages, hard bound) books to be able to play? (This is a real issue for some people; The sheer tininess of the books made them easy to discount when I first encountered the scene) Is it just that they really like D20-esque rules?</p>\n<p>'cause there are indie games that satisfy all of those objections. Some games (like the aforementioned Shadow of Yesterday, or The Riddle of Steel, if it's still able to be found in print) are nice, crunchy games with a very traditional feel. Some games (again, The Riddle of Steel, and at least some others) are big ol' solid books with supplements even.

There's a wide, wide variety of styles that fall into the indie/small-press and "Story" games categories. Sometimes, it's not even a matter of the game as the techniques used. Look at some of the play discussions about D&amp;D here, and over on the Forge, where certain techniques born (or at least popularized) in indie gaming have been introduced successfully to traditional games like D&amp;D, Shadowrun, L5R, etc.</p>\n<p>As for me: 3:16 helped. It was a game I introduced by saying "Hey, I've got this game that I can explain to you, we can make characters, and play a full session in 2-3 hours. It's all about space marines shooting up aliens for Terra." I received lifted eyebrows, skeptical expressions and grudging nods of acceptance to my proposal. Two hours later, I've got people laughing and asking where they could find the game for sale as we clean up to go home for the night. It's a test-drive with option to buy, and it takes no more commitment than playing a boardgame.</p>\n<p>The Riddle of Steel also helped me get some trad players into trying indie games. It's a big ol' game full of pulpy fantasy goodness, with crunchy rules that include such mechanical "comfort food" as encumbrance rules. There are lists of weapons and armor, a nice and flavorful table of general equipment ("wolf, not happy" was something you could buy). Then when you play, you find that your contributions to the fiction matter, and that by playing proactively rather than following the bread crumbs the GM lays out, you do better. The game doesn't work as written any other way.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_209979">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209979/#Comment_209979" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-02T06:46:56+00:00" title="June  2, 2009  6:46AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I play indie games mostly at indie-games-oriented meetups, conventions, and with people I met through the indie games community or through the local indie games playgroup (SGBoston) that I started locally.

You can throw down Agon or BW or SOTC, depending on what kind of background your home crew has, and be fine.

Then came a pitch to the group -- "Hey, this game looks pretty fun, I'd like to run it, let me tell you about it."  Then came general nodding and approval, because the game that was pitched sounded like it would be good.  Then we played, and had a good time, and decided that we'd like to play it again sometime.<br/><br/>No long, drawn-out discussions of theory, no expectation that the new game would be anything other than a fun thing to try playing, and no lingering resentment on the occasions when the game turned out NOT to be fun; basically, we just used the same process that went into deciding to play, say, D&amp;D3 for the first time, or nWoD, or whatever.

People don't like to be "converted," they like to play fun games.  If you make it an ideological conflict (which is silly anyway), you will breed unnecessary dissent.  You also have to be as open-minded as you're expecting them to be.  If you roll your eyes about "those primitive trad games" expect the same reaction when you bring up "those crazy indie games."  In short, don't bother making a distinction between "indie" and "trad."  Games = Games.  <br/><br/><img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/>  Create a group culture that revolves around playing short campaigns and one-shots.  You'll cycle through a lot more games that way.    <br/><br/>C)  If your group flat out doesn't want to play the games that you do, look for some new folks to play with.  Check out nearbygamers.com and hit some people up.  It doesn't mean you have to drop your old group, just broaden your horizons a bit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_210126">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210126/#Comment_210126" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-03T06:29:13+00:00" title="June  3, 2009  6:29AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Clint is wise.  <br/><br/>You can also make new gamers - games with high excitement and low commitment are a nice way to spend an evening with friends, and you never know who will ask to come back for more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210149">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210149/#Comment_210149" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-03T08:33:20+00:00" title="June  3, 2009  8:33AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All the "find new folks" and "ease in" and other advice about the social situation is great--follow it, Seth.<br/><br/>But I'll go ahead and read the OP as I think it was intended: a poll to find which games have a great "grab" to attract folks to regular play (regardless of whether they leave "trad" games, or continue them with another group or at another time, or even have never been gamers). I'll use myself, as I was a "nothing but HERO" guy for years, until....<br/><br/>My first "indie" experience was <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> in a one-shot con game, run by someone with a lot of experience with it (*ahem* he's in this thread), and it ran well and I loved the scope of the narrative power that it granted. Here was a game that let me be the sort of kook that I like to role play and, dammit, that had leverage (i.e. it wasn't epiphenomenal to the "actually important" crunchy bits that the "trad" games gave me to affect the SIS). But if I had not read a fair bit about DitV, I might have struggled to get into that mode of play (at least for a while). <i>This is the game that I would introduce someone who has demonstrated disaffection with charts and graphs and classes and feats--someone wanting their character to be more than a functional role.</i><br/><br/>Not long afterward, I played <i>Contenders</i>, and again it gave a lot of room to tell story and have it stick, but it *also* had this fun and easy-to-learn "mini game" of the boxing match. Great resource management, tough decisions, a bit of strategy, a bit of luck--GREAT intro game to anyone who's seen Rocky or Raging Bull. <i>This is the game that I would introduce to a non-gamer or to someone who wanted "just to give it a try, no commitment."</i><br/><br/>By that point, I'm collecting indie games, playing a few at the local game store or friends' houses, and exploring the boundaries of the "indie" design space. Anyone who knows me (and the games on which I am working) will know I'm a freak for the toolbox, for the universal engine, for the "one game book I'd take to a desert island." Enter <i>Universalis</i>, with all its world creation, challenges, fact creation, and mechanics to make those facts matter. Flexible but structured--this is no freeform, and yet I could see the potential for ANY story to be modeled with it. Though a bit leery of losing the direct coupling of player to character, I could see the potential that such a break from "tradition" opened up. <i>This is the game that I would introduce to actors, improv-ers, writers, and other creative types who might never play a "trad" game, with its mechanical minutiae, genre conventions, and rituals.</i><br/><br/>And then there was <i>Burning Wheel</i> (though I'd bought and read <i>Burning Empires</i> first). *Glee* A combination of all the crunch you care to employ, with a "points build" system that reflected the game world without pigeonholing a PC into one of ten archetypes, and a powerful reward and resource mechanic that made character matter and gave players agency. It's my go-to game, now, for any but the most easily distracted, easily overwhelmed, or stubbornly competitive. <i>This is the game that I would introduce to a group of gamers who were curious about the "indie" thing but who I though would likely balk at something that gave them a high degree of narrative agency.</i><br/><br/>I hope this helps you, Seth, with what I imagine was your intent all along when you sought advice in this thread: continuing to play with <i>these</i> friends, <i>these</i> free nights, while branching out to a style of play that is very hard to get at with "trad" games. Or making new gamers out of other friends, with systems and setting that don't overwhelm anyone not already into genre fiction and the like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_210167">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210167/#Comment_210167" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-03T09:51:34+00:00" title="June  3, 2009  9:51AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I will answer the question in the original post.<br/>Have Games, Will Travel got me into indie games.  I heard Paul talk about Polaris (and I listened to his actual play recordings) and I thought "Whoa.  I didn't know RPGs could DO that!" then I went to Gen Con and picked a few up.  ARound the same time I also started listening to other gaming podcasts like the Sons of Kryos and coming here.  And buying more games.<br/><br/>Most of this is probably not helpful information for any practical use.  In my case, I'd been into games for a long time, but most of those I'd seen did things all more or less the same kinda way.  I knew about D&amp;D and I knew about White Wolf games.  The games I'd read that were the most "different" were Unknown Armies and Over the Edge.  I've always been someone who was interested in the new and the different.  So that was what grabbed me about indie games.  Polaris definitely does things a lot differently than any other other game I'd ever heard of.  So that's still a big thing that grabs my attention even now, is something that seems different and interesting.  But that's not going to be true about everyone.  The two friends I normally play with, for example, they're willing to try about anything, but they aren't people that are interested in new things just because they're new.  And I know there are people that prefer to stick with familiar ways of doing things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210301">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

This is not about Indie vs. Trad. You can't force people to play a game they don't "get".<br/>\n  For instance, I was playing with a group and we were playing CP2020. I thought they dug some of the Asian vibes and we had been playing the Legend of the 5 Rings CCG.<br/>\n  So, I suggested playing L5R RPG.<br/>\n  It was an unmitigated disaster. I wanted to play 47 Ronin, they wanted to play D&amp;D with karate.<br/>\n<br/>\n  This doesn't have anything to do with converting, or the old "indie vs. trad" dichotomy. This has to do with, we wanted something different from L5R.<br/>\n<br/>\n  What I am trying to say is, if you try an indie game and the group doesn't grok it. It might just be the setting, genre conventions or something else that isn't clicking. It might have nothing to do with it being indie.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Also, sometimes, you can oversell something. I can get most people to try DITV if I just say, "you play a wild west paladin with a pistol instead of a sword." And that communicates a lot more to most players than, "You play in a fictional Mormon state in a wild west that never was."<br/>\n<br/>\n  Finally, if you say, this game is indie and I want to try more indie games. And it flops, you have just co-mingled every game you like into this one bad experience. And, honestly, most indie games have very different look/feel/playstyles. Playing DITV produces a different experience/feel than PTA, no? So why lump them into one non-existent genre?<br/>\n<br/>\n  I mean, if the people you are dealing with are the kind that root for small business over big box chains, then its a selling point that its indie, but if the don't know or don't care who makes their games, its just a useless label that may work against you moving forward, no?<br/>\n<br/>\n  I dunno, that's just my thoughts, good luck getting a group of indie players and have fun games man.<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210339/#Comment_210339" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-04T11:15:45+00:00" title="June  4, 2009 11:15AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Dave,</p>\n<p>Your thoughts, they are wise.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
