                    komradebob raised interesting questions about submitting short games to non game magazines - http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1052&amp;page=1#Item_5<br/>
<br/>
I had some thoughts in response to his broader point that  "... I rarely hear of anyone trying to really break out of gaming/hobby-oriented markets with anything at all these days." I'm going to focus on breaking down doors to the academic/ literary side of the cultural market. (Matthijs started a neat thread on dreaming up games for different magazines that allows for more far raging brainstorming between high, low and middle brow culture and all kinds of niche markets).<br/>
<br/>
So here's an ill thought out agenda for promoting a specific game outside the gaming world and simutaneously trying to make the case that rpgs/story games are an intellectually and creatively flourishing field that deserve more attention from the cultural/ academic/ artistic/ critical world of journals, book reviews, mainstream and academic publishers, conferences, funders, etc.<br/>
<br/>
1. submit a version or section of a game to a literary journal or a cultural/political magazine <br/>
2. send drafts of the game to 'names' in an academic or cultural field that your game connects to, asking for feedback and blurbs. Make all efforts to have at least one of the plurbs for your game be from someone who has zero connections to rpgs.<br/>
3. promote and distribute the game on non-gaming list-serves etc relating to issues that your game touches on<br/>
4. submit proposals for panel discussions, papers, and talks on your game to academic and general interest conferences<br/>
5. seek funding for your game from government and foundation cultural funders <br/>
6. advertise your game in at least one non-gaming journal or website<br/>
7. submit your game to non-gaming publishing companies (mainstream &amp; academic presses)<br/>
8. send at least one review copy of your completed game (whether self published or published by a book publisher) to a journal or book review<br/>
<br/>
I assume some of these steps will be futile but some could pay off. thoughts?                </div>

                            The University I work for did some research in utilising games in teaching and career development. Roleplay was of course one of the things that was covered (mainly in an online chat way). I sent the people involved a link to Executive Decision, as I thought it would be of interest. I mean to talk to them about indie games and publishing at some point. <br/><br/>I think one of the most under-used forms of promotion in the hobby is the outreach programmes that I know Games Workshop do. They provide kits for Libraries to use to start a gaming club and get young folk interested in reading (while co-incidentally addicting them to GW games). Parents like it as it keeps the kids out of trouble and encourages those who don't read well by giving them something to enthuse about. I think a similar approach could work in a pretty great way for RPGs, if presented in the right way. Plus you get 'em while they're young.<br/><br/>Also in terms of branching out there's already some cross-over in similar fields, there was a reasonably well selling "adult choose your own adventure" recently in the UK (<a>Whatever you want</a>).                        </div>

                            PTA (there's a PTA2e?) is particularly suited for this I think, as although it contains very clear and well written descriptions of what roleplaying involves and how it works it never once refers IIRC to roleplaying, RPGs or any other traditional terms.<br/><br/>Instead, rather shockingly, it uses plain English.  It's tremendously impressive actually, tons of very trad concepts such as being in character are described without once using a term intrinsic to the hobby that wouldn't be understandable outside of the hobby.<br/><br/>And that I think is key.  If you market outside the hobby, you need to be understandable outside of the hobby.  PTA is one of the very few games I can think of that pass that test.                        </div>

                            I thought about this for my game Group Therapy, because it deals with the Freudian aspects of the mind and how they interrelate to daily stresses. Unfortunately, the game's been indenfinitely shelved due to trouble with the mechanics. I'll revisit it someday, once it's had time to germinate.<br/><br/>Also, Breaking the Ice is the best game I've seen that has a real shot at being marketed outside the gaming crowd: adult book stores, relationship counselors, the list is potentially endless.                        </div>

<a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/library" rel="nofollow">WotC has a D&amp;D kit designed specifically for librarians</a> - it's the boxed game with minis, basic rules, etc, along with promotional materials and some pamphlets.  One of the pamplets is written by a youth services librarian and goes over logistical stuff related to running a game in the library, and another addresses parent concerns and the positive aspects of roleplaying.  There are also posters and fliers to sample.  It's a very slick package, and they sent it free to any YA librarian who asked for a while.  No more for 2006, alas.                        </div>

<p>Related to the literary approaches mentioned above: why not design a book that is primarily fiction, but with game stats and minimalist rules in marginalia or an appendix? Ben Lehman was planning to do something like this with <em>The Drifter's Escape</em>, as I recall, although it was more half of each. But you could get more extreme, abandoning all but the very basic rules for the novel... or, if you don't feel you have a novel in you, maybe a sort of fictional non-fiction work similar to <em>Gnomes</em>.</p>

                            Currently, I'm doing research for a game that, in addition to being way fun, teaches you 1) about recent scholarship on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shang_Dynasty" rel="nofollow">the Shang people</a> and 2) how to read and write <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_bone_script" rel="nofollow">oracle bone script</a>.  My plan is to get someone else to publish it and not publish it myself, but I'm going to have to wait until I'm further along to see what the possibilities might be.                        </div>

                            This was sort of my primary goal with Sweet Agatha. I plan on selling the game in hipster gift boutiques and trying to make dave eggers shit his pants. The more soiled that mans pants, the better i will feel.                        </div>
