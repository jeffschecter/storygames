There's no stasis. Maybe one pairing will chill for a bit, but then another pairing flares up.<br/><br/>So here's my idea, for a game that otherwise has been flying onto the pages as a flagrant, willy nilly theft of ideas:<br/><br/>It's the crew of a ship, right? And everyone has everyone else's character as a connection (I re-use my trait names; sue me). Every relationship/connection has a point of tension, and addressing those points of tension is how you earn your goodies in play.<br/><br/>So with Firefly as a reference, Zoe, Wash and Mal would probably have their complex triangle as a point of tension. That is, Wash's tension with Mal is about Zoe, and his point of tension with Zoe is about Mal. When the level of tension changes, either toward better or toward worse, Wash gets XP.<br/><br/>Now, what I don't want in play is reckless abandon. That kind of stuff is only good on TV when the characters and show maintain a sense of integrity. So it would suck to have play be like, "we get into a fight again! Give me XP."<br/><br/> I was considering a couple ideas:<br/><br/>1) you can't earn XP from the same relationship twice in a row. Like Wash can't just corner Mal and fight with him for the whole episode.<br/><br/>2) instead of a generic sense of tension, the player writes out three specific gripes, and you get 1 XP per episode per gripe when it comes up.<br/><br/>Except <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> still feels a little laundry listy to me, like, "okay, I complained to Zoe about calling Mal sir, now what?"<br/><br/>Suggestions?

Give me XP."</blockquote>\nThe key problem is that there is no set of rules that can prevent this from happening, or enable players to produce better dialog....<br/><br/>...nor make them WANT to.<br/><br/>If the players are there for the relationships and dialog, they're going to produce those naturally. The best a mechanic can do is give the players something specific to talk about (which incidentally, the Serenity game doesn't seem to to). And if they're there for other things, they will just treat these thematic elements as simple game resources, and invest as little time and effort into them as possible. Since these elements are basically interaction with other player characters, such rules could even potentially make the situation worse because now any natural interaction that may take place at the table will have rule expectations attached to it.<br/><br/>From my game design experience, I also think there has to be a mechanical cost to this beyond just choosing to interact, such as taking the risk that you will not be able to get any or as much XP from the relationship in the future (it dissolved to the point where you no longer interact with them at all, or it changed so much that the entire thing needs to be reevaluated), or by risking the loss of some amount of meta currency in the hope that your gamble pays off and you end up with more (you're testing the boundaries of the relationship, and as long as it holds to your expectations, you can feel more socially secure).<br/><br/>And this mechanic can be as simple as a variation of the prisoner's dilemma, where as long as both parties react as expected, they are both slightly reward, but if one reacts differently then they are highly rewarded while the other pays a cost. And if they both respond unexpectedly then they post pay a cost, which I usually apply to the countdown for some specific event.<br/><br/>But I know you probably already know all this. Your post is just helping me get my own thoughts in order, because your line just perfectly sums up a problem I continually run into, especially among 'gamers'.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_78804">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78804/#Comment_78804" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-29T14:35:35+00:00" title="June 29, 2007  2:35PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm been chewing on this idea some more, and thinking about Firefly, one of the big deals is that these tense character moments aren't in a vacuum -- they're done alongside their lives.  Like the big Mal-Zoe-Wash episode where Mal &amp; Wash are tortured by Niska.<br/><br/>So, I'm thinking there should be more than "we get into a fight".  Perhaps this framework might, uh, work: you can have do something (like the Scrips idea I mentioned above) to have a minor scene that primes the upcoming Issue -- Wash &amp; Zoe have an argument about her obedience to Mal.  That priming then colors the major elements of that "episode" or "adventure" -- Wash deals with his issue while being tortured by Niska.  These scenes are the only way that characters can gain XP, but they're also the only ways that characters can be permanently injured (in the various capacities: physically, mentally, socially, etc.).  Other characters are free to act, be cool, and could be taken out temporarily, but they neither grow nor truly risk themselves in these scenes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_78822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan" title="AnonAdderlan (Banned)"><img alt="AnonAdderlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan">AnonAdderlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78822/#Comment_78822" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-29T15:25:52+00:00" title="June 29, 2007  3:25PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Macklin</cite>These scenes are the only way that characters can gain XP, but they're also the only ways that characters can be permanently injured (in the various capacities: physically, mentally, socially, etc.).

Idea schmorgasborg.<br/><br/>This is how my D&amp;D mod works. The only way you gain XP is by converting lost HP at an exchange rate based on the class of the character (in other words, Wizards may have fewer HP, but they get more XP for losing them).<br/><br/>The thing I would warn everyone about is to not make things too complex. I've found to my amazement that that single HP type resource can be used for EVERYTHING, including the state of multiple wounds, beliefs, and relationships. In just one semantic trick you can rename HP to 'Experience' and XP to 'Wisdom'. Now 'Damage' becomes anything the character cannot cope with and remain in the same state (regardless of if that state change is losing limbs, going insane, or falling in/out of love), and 'Armor' becomes how resistant they are to specific state changes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_78892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78892/#Comment_78892" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-30T05:46:25+00:00" title="June 30, 2007  5:46AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            i'd just like to add that wash and jayne don't butt heads cuz they are very different.  people with simular outlooks often times butt heads...i'm not sure why.  what makes characters compliment each other, what makes interesting friction?  <br/>i guess Wash and Mal both had a form of love for Zoe...and somehow that simularity led to conflict.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_79083">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Quintin%20Stone" title="Quintin Stone"><img alt="Quintin Stone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://rps.net/QS/Images/pipboy-32x32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Quintin%20Stone">Quintin Stone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79083/#Comment_79083" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-02T09:10:30+00:00" title="July  2, 2007  9:10AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 2, 2007 9:11AM by Quintin Stone.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "You know what the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIxQhNGhHTo" rel="nofollow">chain of command</a> is?

Which is why Whedon's stuff feels so much like watching someone else's roleplaying session.<br/><br/>The corollary there is that the best way to recreate the feeling of FIrefly is not to try to treat your relationships with other people as Keys, but to treat them like character abilities.  That somehow, my character has 3-6 abilities that by themselves are useful, but in certain circumstances they stack with other abilities to give me neat powers with creative applications.  Think something like Mal + Jayne =&gt; D&amp;D Ventriloquism.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
