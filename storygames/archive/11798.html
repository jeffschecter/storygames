In the GPC, there are lots of battles between Britons and Saxons (or Britons and their other foes) wherein the outcomes are predetermined. The ultimate victory or defeat taken out of the PCs' hands leaves the battles as an exercise in number-crunching, unless the GM makes sure to reintegrate PC history, enemies, family strife, etc. into them.<br/><br/>Since CF doesn't have a pre-set mass combat system, I've been thinking of ways to present my players with interesting decisions within the context of the battle. Here's what I've come up with:<br/><br/>1. Draw a Tarot card from the deck at random.<br/>2. Assign a problem to the card, given the context of the battle (or other extended conflict) and based on the illustration and possibly the interpretation. <i>eg: The first card I draw is the Queen of Pentacles. In my Tarot set, the illustration is of a rather voluptuous dark-skinned woman, barefoot, with an apple in her hand and a snake on her foot, sitting on a bamboo throne. I decide, based on the sexuality and Garden of Eden imagery explicit in the card, that I will make this a test of temptation.</i><br/>3. Draw two cards for potential outcomes -- these are the things the player will have to choose between. The outcomes don't have to be interpreted yet; they will get fleshed out in detail in the next step. <i>I draw the Wheel of Fortune and the 3 of Wands.</i><br/>4. Consider the details of the problem and the potential outcomes. <i>Temptation is tricky to come across in the heat of the battle. I look to my outcomes for guidance. The Wheel of Fortune implies circuity, and the completion of cycles. The Three of Wands in my deck shows a woman standing on a road, with an airplane flying overhead. The book says it symbolizes journeys and also generosity or fair character.</i><br/>5. Describe the choice, based on your interpretations of the cards and what you know about your players. <i>Looking over what I have, I realize that my PCs have an enemy, a Saxon nobleman who previously spared their lives, releasing them without demanding ransom: a seemingly generous, but humiliating event. This event will consist of one of the player knights coming across that same Saxon, pinned beneath his injured horse, on the battlefield. The outcomes can point to either revenge -- The Wheel of Fortune/death or humiliation -- or mercy -- Three of Wands/taking him captive, or freeing him.</i><br/>6. (optional) Assign a Skill or set of Skills to the problem. Think about what Skills are likely to come up in this test. Consider if they would be obvious (or at least somewhat obvious) from the illustration on the first card. The purpose for this step is to potentially allow players who are trying to earn experience in a specific skill to guess which cards will earn them the desired tests. <i>Thinking about the potential encounter with the Saxon, and looking at the Skills list, I think a PC might try to use Command or Entice. Entice is, at the very least, implied by the sexy Queen of Pentacles, so I think my players will figure it out to be a "Parley"-type challenge.</i><br/>7. Repeat 1-6 until you have enough challenges for everyone in the player group to have one. Try to mix up the types of challenges.<br/>8. At the table, let the players choose which of the problem cards they want to pursue. You can let them decide in whatever order you wish. When the conflict is over, also give them the card that best matches their outcome. Let the player add some details to the interpretation to give it their own colour.<br/><br/>Things to think about:<br/>-once you've got all your challenges planned out, think about combining two or more of them. This will allow the PCs to act as a group, rather than independently;<br/>-don't try to predict which PC will choose which problem; the players will probably surprise you anyway;<br/>-for some prolonged conflicts, there may be multiple "waves" of problems. If this is likely, do 2 or 3 problems per PC.<br/><br/>Thoughts, comments, input, and feedback all welcome.<br/><br/>-AD.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
