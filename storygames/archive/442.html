<p>Over in the thread about Icons &amp; current projects I'd mentioned that I updated my icon &amp; piccie to reflect what I've been working on recently.  Joshua A. <a href="http://www.geocities.com/technocrat13/hello_n.wav" rel="nofollow">Newman</a>, being an apprent fan of at least one of my sources of inspiration, started asking me about it, whisper-style.  My response started getting just a touch lengthy, so I thought I'd just start up a new thread instead.</p>
<p>Lemmie catch everyone else up on the conversation so far (paraphrased):</p>
<p></p><pre><code>Me:  I throw piccies of crypticness all who read this!  
Joshua:  I know of that icon, and challenge you to demonstrate you are worthy!  
Me:  I am bested!  I am not the coolness!  
Joshua:  Repent,  and tell me of this game of which you speak!  
Me:  It has theme, and guns, and explosions, and GM-Full-Ness!  
Joshua:  Tell me what you expect of your GM, or I will crush you like a bug!</code></pre>
<p>In response to Joshua's query about what the GM's responsiblities are, here's my response, cut from an abandoned return whisper;</p>
<p>I'm not sure I've got the game developed enough yet to provide a succinct answer, but lemmie see what I can do.</p>
<p>` *  Each player has a share of GM duties.  That share being determined by the type of characters they've chosen to portray.<br/>
*  As GMs, each player is expected to bring a bit of GM-stylin' preparation to each session.  I'm aiming for about 10-15 minutes of prep per player as a minimum, with the idea that some players may enjoy putting more prep into it.<br/>
*  During play, one acts as the GM (providing opposition to the PCs) when called upon by another player to do so.  Kinda Roach-style there.</p>
<p>And um... you know, there's other stuff there too, but it's all so poorly defined right now.  It's kind of a floating blob of game in my noggin.  Like, I have a vague idea of how it's supposed to work, but haven't spent much time on hammering it out on paper yet.  `</p>
<p>Since I've got your attention, and I'm writing about the game anyway, lemmie tell you quickly about what's got me excited about this deisgn;</p>
<ul>
<li>GM-full-ness, balanced against every player portraying a member of a team (bent on saving the world)</li>
<li>Shopping lists of toys.  Toys like guns, and explosives, and vehicles, and cyberware.</li>
<li>A skills list that actually does what I want it to do; Inspire the setting at hand.</li>
<li>A four-hour/session objective, where something gets resolved in that session, but something else doesn't get resolved, which, I imagine, will inspire the players to want to come back for more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Gotta run, it's lunch time.  Catcha all later.</p>

<p>The difference between one flavor of GM and another is the um... <em>echelon</em> of mission situation that they need to build.  A player at the 'top' of the chain might come to the table with "Thwart plan to assassinate Bank Owner", and that would be the core of the mission.  Another player might independently design the situation of "Prevent plane crash."  Now, preventing the plane crash becomes part of thwarting the plan to assassinate the Bank Owner.  We won't know how those two objectives meet until we get together &amp; start playing.</p>
<p>The prep time is for mission situation building.  What's going to stand in the way of stopping that plane from crashing?  What kind of choices might a team member have to make while on this part of the mission?  That kind of stuff.  Something analogous to both DitV's Town Building, and the stuff I used to do to prep to play Shadowrun.</p>

<p>I've done quite a bit of work on <strong><em>Invisible Shepherds</em></strong> recently, and the whole GM-thing has seen some dramatic refinement.  I'd like to share those changes with you.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, the game is about an elite team of cyborgs tasked with preventing a very quiet alien invasion.  The cyborgs are known as the Shepherds, the aliens as the Wolves, and the ignorant masses as, obviously, the Sheep.</p>
<p>In character creation each player authors two members of the cyborg team, one PC Shepherd and one NPC Shepherd.  For my purposes PC = Protagonist Character and NPC = Not a Protagonist Character.  The Shepherd characters each fall into one of five categories.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Director            (NPC only)</li>
<li>The Commander     (PC or NPC)</li>
<li>A Specialist             (PC or NPC)</li>
<li>A Grunt                   (PC only)</li>
<li>A Robot                   (NPC only)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each team must contain one Director and one Commander (exactly one of each) and while it probably won't break the game for one player to play both, I'm going to encourage players to have those two played by different players.</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p><strong>The Director</strong> is the character that heads up the team without usually taking part in any of the Big Action.  He or she is often behind the scenes and political in nature.</p>
<p><strong>The Commander</strong> is the character that reports directly to the Director and commands the team in the field.  Usually responsible for the safety and well-being of the team as a whole.</p>
<p><strong>A Specialist</strong> is a Shepherd who has a tremendous amount of relevant experience doing what the Shepherds do; Military field work, espionage, etc, etc.  Generally reports directly to the Commander.  Frequently responsible for leading Grunts.  There has to be at least one Specialist on each team, but there are no restrictions on how many Specialists there can be.</p>
<p><strong>A Grunt</strong> is well... you probably get the picture.  Possibly less experienced than a Specialist, but not necessarily so.  No restrictions on the number of Grunts on a team.</p>
<p><strong>A Robot.</strong>  Artificial intelligence in an artificial chassis.  No restrictions on the number of Robots on a team.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Ok, so there's lots more to be said about those five classifications and how they relate to game play, but I'll keep it at that for now.  We have everything I think we need to talk about the GMing divisions.</p>
<h4>Pre-session, each player is responsible for authoring certain bits of The Mission.</h4>
<p>The player who authors and plays the Director is responsible for authoring the Objective.  The Objective will generally center around The Bad Thing, which is also the Director-player's responsiblity to author.  The Bad Thing is something that a Wolf has done or is trying to do.  The Objective is to thwart the plans of or undo the mess that the Wolf has done.</p>
<p>The Commander player authors the Wolf.  Who is this 'person', what are their goals, and what are their resources?  The Commander-player authors the Wolf with no knowlege of what the Director-player authors as an Objective or Bad Thing.</p>
<p>Every Specialist player authors Teeth.  Teeth are the obstacles that will get in the way of the Shepherds achieving the Objective.  Teeth can be hazards like Guard Dogs, A Well-armed Security Team, or Lasers From Space.  They can be unknown elements, like not knowing when the objective can take place, or where the Wolf is hiding.  I'm kinda hip-deep in tuning up the Teeth right now, but you get the idea of what the Specialist-players need to do.</p>
<p>As of right this minute, having a Grunt character or Robot character presents you with no responsibilities for pre-session prep work.  I'd kind of done that on purpose so that players who wanted to avoid doing much prep could theoretically take a Grunt/Robot combination and get out of the work.  But now I have a vague idea for other things that I'd like to see thrown in as prep and I no longer think that any player should be missing the responsiblity of prep.</p>
<p>So, looking back on the idea that each character type brings different responsiblities to the players, and each player always has two characters, we can see that players can mix &amp; match what their responsiblities are for pre-game prep.</p>
<p>I welcome any questions, even if they don't relate to the GM-prep thing.</p>

<p><code>Why can't grunts be NPCs?</code></p>
<p>Because Grunts will be my antithesis to Robots.  Grunts will be the characters that struggle most with their personal Issues.  NPCs don't get any Issues to deal with.  Therefore Grunts must be PCs.  To underline their personal issues.</p>
<p>I know you don't watch the anime that inspired this game, Jason, but I'll say this for the GITS crowd out there;  The Grunt is inspired by Togusa.  Togusa's struggle to maintain a normal homelife inspired the idea that the Grunt character would be the type to have a slightly greater lean on personal issues, mechanically, than the other character types.</p>
<p><code>What if everybody wants to be robots?</code></p>
<p>Just so long as someone takes on the Director, who must be an NPC, everyone else is free to take Robots as their NPC character.  I don't see any issues here.  Do you?</p>
<p><code>What if nobody wants to be Commander?</code></p>
<p>Well, that'll be filed under "tough shit".  Someone must take the Commander as a character.  Do you think this might actually be an issue?</p>
<p><code>I actually think creating a "responsibility free" slot is a good idea, since there are varying levels of commitment and time to prep in every group.</code></p>
<p>I agree.  But that's only half of the argument.  The other half is that I anticipate prep time for each player per session to be pretty brief.  Maybe fifteen minutes to half an hour at most, for the player who wants to go in-depth, or as little as five or ten minutes for the player that's in a rush.  With that in mind, is it really too much to ask that every player who comes to the table come with the same amount of responsiblity?</p>

                            I'm being a deviled advocate, of course, with extra paprika.  <br/><br/>If somebody must take a particular role, why not make all the roles mandatory in the optimal mix?  If nobody is specialist, you don't get the k3wl teeth, right?  And that's not fun.  Just a thought.  There's probably a perfect team mix for 3,4,5,6 players.  <br/><br/>The 'responsibility free' thing - it's perfectly fine to invoke the "I wouldn't want to play with people who can't be bothered put in fifteen minutes" rule.  However, I regularly game with people who will contribute, in terms of prep, exactly jack shit.  And they are nice people and fun to game with.  I really like the idea of being able to hand them a character sheet and say "welcome, name your fucking robot, let's go."                        </div>

<p><code>I think you may have hit on something awesomely cool.</code></p>
<p>Thanks Mark!  I've acutally had our conversations about <strong><em>Shadowrun</em></strong> and <em>cyberpunk</em> on my mind quite a bit while working on this.</p>
<p><code>As for the Grunt/Robot combo, it does allow for two kinds of player to have their fun:</code></p>
<p>The convention-thing has been on my mind off and on as I've been writing.  I think that, without some kind of major change, running this at a convention will almost certainly mean prepping the entire team and their associated prep-work before arrival.  While the prep-work it's self shouldn't take all that much time, teaching how to prep and why to prep and what makes for good prep might be just a little too much for an average convention game.</p>
<p>Of course, that might just mean that this won't ever be an average convention game and it won't fit into a 4-hr convention slot.  I'll be ok with that if it ends up being the case.</p>
<p><code>I'd also want the Director to have to deal with Pack Circling, which would be non-Wolf threats coming in from the rear (government inspectors, cuts in funding, moles, etc.)</code></p>
<p>I think what you're looking for is already addressed in the rules.  See, there's this currency that I call Public Opinion.  It should really be called Negative Public Opinion or possibly Public Outrage, but Public Opinion has really stuck in my head for some reason.  Anyway, you would earn points of Public Opinion whenever you're playing a Sheep or Wolf character in a conflict against another player who's playing a Shepherd character <strong><em>and</em></strong> they're using bigger guns than you. *  You can then turn around and use your Public Opinion points to buy up more dice when you're playing a Sheep character in a conflict against a Shepherd.</p>
<p>Which should end up meaning that when the team goes and blows up an entire city block to get at one badguy, you can then turn around and take on the role of... oh, say, The Prime Minister, who cuts the Director's budget and slaps him on the wrist for misconduct.  Or, more accurately, you could do that scene anyway, but hopefully your newly found stack of Public Opinion points will inspire you to create that scene and bash the Director-player in the head with all yer points.</p>

<p>mmmmm.... paprika....</p>
<p>I think the solution for the 'responsiblity-free' thing I'll go with will probably be some kind of compromise, like giving Grunt and Robot players some authority to author something into the mission without the responsiblity to do so.  Simply put; some optional authoring.</p>
<p><code>If somebody must take a particular role, why not make all the roles mandatory in the optimal mix? If nobody is specialist, you don't get the k3wl teeth, right? And that's not fun. Just a thought. There's probably a perfect team mix for 3,4,5,6 players.</code></p>
<p>That's a pretty solid idea, Jason.  I don't think you'd be able to pair the characters up in the mix-requirement, but you could be all like;</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>2 players = 1 Director, 1 Commander, 1 Specialist, 1 Grunt<br/>
  3 players = 1 Director, 1 Commander, 2 Specialist, 1 Grunt, 1 Robot<br/>
  4 players = 1 Director, 1 Commander, 2 Specialist, 2 Grunt, 2 Robot<br/>
  5 players = 1 Director, 1 Commander, 3 Specialist, 3 Grunt, 2 Robot<br/>
  6 players = 1 Director, 1 Commander, 3 Specialist, 5 Grunt, 3 Robot</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Or something like that.  Then let the players mix as necessary.</p>

<p>Very true.  But in Bang! it's a necessary mechanism.  I'm certain that it won't be a necessary mechanism for <strong><em>Invisible Shepherds</em></strong>, and I'm not yet 100% convinced that it'll even be a good mechanism.</p>
<p>The only value I can see in it right now is controlling the mix on Specialists, which means controlling the level of Teeth-resources in relation to the number of players.  With no prep-work for Grunts &amp; Robots, I don't see any need to require a certain number of one or the other.</p>

                            You know you need X and Y and some finite number of Z, the rest is chaff.  Let people check off the parts they want in two rounds, PC first then NPC, from the list.  <br/><br/>This approach has the added benefit (?) of providing some implicit guidance about how you intend for the game to be played.  Maybe add some verbiage about how easy it is to make unlimited wacky teams once everybody is experienced with how the game plays.                        </div>

<p>That's a fantastic example, Jason.  The minor error you made illustrates the minor issue that I've got with it.</p>
<p>The Director and Robots cannot be PCs.... aaaaaaaannd... a Grunt cannot be an NPC.  But with limited supplies of each it seems pretty darned likely that some player some time is going to want a specific NPC-only character over any particular PC.  What I'm so obtusely saying is that I don't see any need to have the PCs chosen in the first round and the NPCs chosen in the second round.  Let it get all mixed up.</p>
<p>Of course, in either version, we'd have to contend with making sure that everyone gets 1 PC and 1 NPC.  Because some of the classes can be either PC or NPC and some must be one or the other, there's the possiblity that the last person to pick a character might get 'stuck'.</p>
<p>Twisting Jason's example;</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>3 players = 1 Director, 1 Commander, 2 Specialist, 1 Grunt, 1 Robot</p>
<p>J:  Commander PC!<br/>
   M:  Specialist PC!<br/>
   E:  Specialist PC + Robot NPC!<br/>
   M:  Director NPC!<br/>
   J:  Um... I need an NPC, but only the Grunt is left...</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Actually, I suppose that issue could be resolved by declaring that the PC or NPC only characters have to be chosen first... but then it seems to be cutting into the funocity of this choosing-method.</p>
<p>I might have another solution, one that got in my head a while back.  It came to me when I considered the possiblity that the players may have a hard time deciding who plays the Commander and Director.  The idea was to not only have a pre-set list of classes to play but to also pre-pair them <em>and</em> randomly distribute via playing cards.</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>(hmm... as I'm constructing this list, I'm starting to see that I think I'm going to want Grunts to be available as NPCs.  For now, consider Grunts to be PC/NPC worthy, but with the Director and Robots still relegated to the land of NPC-only-dom.)</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Ace:       Specialist/Director<br/>
King:      Commander/Robot<br/>
Queen:  Specialist/Grunt (interchangable PC-ness)<br/>
Jack:      Grunt/Robot (or Grunt/Grunt)<br/>
Queen:  Specialist/Grunt (interchangable PC-ness)<br/>
Jack:      Grunt/Robot (or Grunt/Grunt)</p>
<p>This method could be filed under AwesomeFast, but loosing some of the versitility of choosing for yourself.  I get the feeling that the final text will contain a variety of options for deciding who plays what kind of character.</p>
<p>And.... now that I think of it, going back to Jason's suggestion for choosing, with Grunts as PC/NPC availablity, if we stick with the idea of PCs-first, then there's no longer any issue.  Come to the last pick, every character type available with either be NPC-only or PC/NPC choice, so having to pick an NPC last works out just fine.</p>
<p>Funny how things can fall into place like that with just a minor change or two.</p>
