(Otherwise the players would go into it knowing for sure "it's all just a dream" and that would suck a lot of the fun out of it.)<br/><br/>And then I thought, somebody *must* have done it already.<br/><br/>What game out there best supports, or would best support, this kind of fiction?<br/><br/>Is this the closest we've got?:  <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forge/index.php?topic=28190.0" rel="nofollow">http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forge/index.php?topic=28190.0</a><br/><br/>If nothing you can think of does it already, what would you hack to do it?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_303615">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303615/#Comment_303615" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-07T16:30:03+00:00" title="December  7, 2010  4:30PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 7, 2010 4:34PM by DannyK.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lacuna is pretty good for this IMO, lightly structured surrealism.  <br/><br/>Nobilis, too, at least in my experience of running and playing it.<br/><br/>EDIT: whatever happened to psi run?

Dick. Well, with the serial numbers filled off, mixed up with a few spoonfulls of Killgore Trout, L. Ron Hubbard and whatever. Basically late 20th century sci-fi authors on drugs, with reality breaking down arround them. <br/>At least that's how I remember the pitch.<br/><br/>Aaand, I found it on <a href="http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/left-coast" rel="nofollow">1km1kt</a>, it's called Left Coast. The synopsis reads:\n<blockquote>Left Coast \u2013 You play a semi-famous science fiction author living in 196s California. You and your peers are all scrabbling for the Big Break, held back by your everyday lives and problems \u2013 marriage, children, rent. So they feud with each other, struggle not to go nuts under the strain of their immense creativity and try to determine which of them is really a disguised extra-terrestrial. Left Coast is inspired by reading about Philip K. Dick, Robert A. Heinlein and L. Ron Hubbard. It was written for the October Ronnies and uses the keywords \u2018fight\u2019 and \u2018cosmos\u2019.<br/><br/>    Endless summer evenings in verging-on-seedy suburbs and cities. Your neighbours are off-kilter; some wild, some loose, some going quietly crazy in their own private ways; all living in the vapour trails of Beatnik, Hippy &amp; Me generation revolutions (you can take for granted there are a lot of drugs around).<br/><br/>    This is the California of idealised memory \u2013 a time that combines the best creative influences of the 195s, 6s &amp; 7s.</blockquote>\nEdit: Oh, it's by Steve Hickey.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_303654">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thor" title="thor"><img alt="thor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/thorhansen/Pictures?authkey=Gv1sRgCKPylM61jtOQbA#5529849930194336866"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thor">thor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303654/#Comment_303654" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-08T07:00:14+00:00" title="December  8, 2010  7:00AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that there could be a style of play where you let things enter the narrative freely for the first half of the game and then begin answering them through the second half.

After a few rounds, we realized that he always answered Yes.  Sometimes Yes And or Yes But, but never ever No.  Once we had enough material made for the game, we played regular Over the Edge for the rest of the session, facing the reality destroying weirdness we had created in the first half.

Then each player gets to investigate the mystery, and come up with an explanation for it.  Once everyone gives a story for "the truth", the person who introduced the mystery decides which version they like best, and that is the true one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_303858">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Suna" title="Suna"><img alt="Suna" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Suna">Suna</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303858/#Comment_303858" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-10T00:15:55+00:00" title="December 10, 2010 12:15AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lacuna would feel like the right choice for me, too, although I can't say I'm a fan of the game.
