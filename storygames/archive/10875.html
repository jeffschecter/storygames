Draw all the graphics yourself, rather than copying or tweaking rips from the actual video games.<br/><br/>2.) Count on the fact that you will make very little money and are in a very tiny market, so most likely nobody will care what you do; or<br/><br/>3.)

I hand-drew all the graphics, but I was using classic video game sprites for visual models.  While the reindeer is totally in the clear, I think Gerda and the mirror might be a bit too close to be clearly my IP and no one else's (i.e. not derivative).  So I'll have to redraw those at some point, probably without working from any models.<br/><br/>Also, while I like the direction pad and the A + B buttons, again, I'm potentially in dubious waters there, so I'll probably have to find some other way of distinguishing characters various movement and action abilities.<br/><br/>This is just my opinion, of course, and for commercial products I'm more likely to tread on the safer side of infringement, just because I wouldn't want any trouble.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_241265">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241265/#Comment_241265" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-10T11:34:39+00:00" title="November 10, 2009 11:34AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just to clarify, are you looking for American standards on this?

I have no idea how to answer your question since I don't know what those images are from. However, the point of infringement risks occurring anytime you use anyone else's existing material. <br/><br/>I'd check out the <a href="http://www.pixeljoint.com/" rel="nofollow">Pixel Joint</a> for discussions on the art form.  Both the Pixel Joint forum and Pixellation forum (also linked in the Community pulldown - yeah, it's a little confusing) are pretty active.  <br/><br/>There's another old joke: "How do you convey emotions like a puppet in a 16 by 24 pixel frame?" "Practice, practice, practice."<br/><br/>If you don't want to teach yourself, you can probably find people to collaborate with at these forums. I'd also suggest poking around deviant art if that's the primary goal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_241339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241339/#Comment_241339" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-10T16:26:20+00:00" title="November 10, 2009  4:26PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Word.

Either way it seems like the creators don't really know what "public domain" means, which is a shame.  <br/><br/>But I do want to own the work because I want to have the option to license it under CC-Att, CC-Att-SA, or just plain public domain, without entangling anyone downstream with anyone upstream of me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_241511">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241511/#Comment_241511" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-11T14:59:24+00:00" title="November 11, 2009  2:59PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For another method, you could find an icon editor, push a graphic into it, let it make the 16x16 (or 32x32 or whatever) and then use that for the larger-scale model (basically, extract the BMP from the icon file and blow it up to the scale you need). Then, your graphic sources could be nearly anything, because the iconization (new word!) will render them unrecognizable. You might have to tweak a pixel here and there, once blown up, but that's easier than trying to draw from scratch--it's an art form, and a LOT harder than you'd imagine (I've pulled my hair out for hours just trying to get ONE icon for a web site favicon "perfect").                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
