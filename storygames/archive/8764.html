I played it 2d.  I play it 3d.  I follow the dev blog on RSS.  I send him money.  My play of it goes in waves -- I'm busy with other stuff just now, but I'll get back to it.\n<blockquote>Second, What do you think of this game</blockquote>It might seem from my above comments that I like the game.  That's right.  It's frakkin huge!  It's like Animal Crossing meets The Sims meets Rogue.  But, I wish Tarn would spend more effort on improving the UI.  That seems more important than making sure that the game keeps track of what happens to a dog's severed left ear after a fight.\n<blockquote>Is Simulations (used loosely) natural home in the computer, where invisible logic processes can determine what a cruel and impartial world would do better than a person.</blockquote>I tend to think so.\n<blockquote>where does the fun come from</blockquote>One layer of fun is in manipulating the in-game economy.  The first big test is learning the basic UI. The second big test is surviving the winter.  The third is figuring out how to trade.  Somewhere along the way you also had to figure out the 3d nature of the map.  And these steps are each hard!  (But not always in a good way -- see my UI comment above.)  Another layer of fun is in the building.  It's damned cool to lay out your fortress.  And there's always more complicated stuff to add -- fancy water traps, fortifications, carvings, etc.  And another layer of fun is the narrative that builds up over time.  Some of that is directly supported in-game by the weird things the dwarfs do (building masterpieces -- or whatever they're called, is a fun example) and also by the way we players make sense out of them.  Frankly, it's also fun being able to run across someone else who knows the game and being on the <i>inside</i> by being able to discuss it and evangelize to the ones who don't.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_193875">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193875/#Comment_193875" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-24T08:44:21+00:00" title="February 24, 2009  8:44AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dwarf Fortress broke my brain. It was like being handed an astonishingly intricate puzzle built by an advanced culture that you've never heard of using rules you don\u2019t understand. Writing How to Host a Dungeon came about directly from trying to figure out why Dwarf Fortress is fun.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Logos7</cite>What do you think of this game</blockquote>\nI think it's brilliant, not just because it's very good (except for the UI, which could be used as an example of how NOT to build a UI), but because it explores a bunch of regions of fun that are rarely explored. There are a few other games out there that explore this wilderness, but few as good as DF.\n<blockquote>Third, Is Simulations (used loosely) natural home in the computer.</blockquote>\nNo. But there is a kind of simulation that the computer can do that a human can't. <br/><br/>The computer is good at:\n<ul><li>Procedurally generating a world that's too big to grasp all at once</li>\n<li>Modeling the interaction of multiple subtle and hidden influences on events</li>\n<li>Applying complex and counter-intuitive rules that would make a human's head explode</li>\n<li>Storing large amounts of content waiting for discover</li></ul>\nBut it's not good at:\n<ul><li>Answering questions like "what would happen if I did this", where "this" is something not encoded into the input stream</li>\n<li>Adaptively creating content to flesh out a situation</li></ul>\nThere are probably a bunch of other things you can add to those lists, but these come quickly to mind.\n<blockquote>4th , where does the fun come from.</blockquote>\nIt's magic! At least that's what I call the brand of fun that you get when your mouth suddenly drops open because you just saw something completely unexpected and new. When something happens in the simulation, your reaction is to ask why it happened. When your Dwarf stops working and goes to the booze barrel, it\u2019s not hard to figure out why. She\u2019s thirsty.  <br/>But when something magic happens, your brain first interprets it as the emergence of a real world within your imagination. Example: your fortress falls apart in a cascading series of accidents and suicides, leaving one lone soldier standing in the middle of the great hall hacking away mercilessly at your legendary table as he reflects on the fragility of civilization. A series of rules got you there, but rather than try to parse the crazy logic of it, your brain turns it into... I don't know. A story? A poem? An image?<br/><br/>DF does this progressively. The first time my Dwarf gets thirsty, I'm left wondering why he won't work. When I figure out that Dwarves need to drink, and that they prefer booze, there's a little jolt of pleasure because I solved the puzzle. I build a brewery and take steps to ensure there\u2019s always booze available. This is fun. There are a lot of these jolts in DF, because the learning curve is so steep (far steeper than you'd ever find in a commercial game, BTW). But what happens when I can't solve the puzzle? When my whole fortress becomes bigger than my game-player logic can comprehend? Then it becomes magic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_193876">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193876/#Comment_193876" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-24T08:45:07+00:00" title="February 24, 2009  8:45AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Luke Wheel</cite>I am not smart enough or insane enough to play this game.</blockquote>\nMe neither, though I tried.<br/><br/>It's like doing the Friday crossword puzzle of the New York Times in pen, but in 5 dimensions.<br/><br/>"Where do I put my dwarven army?"<br/>"...don't you mean, <b>WHEN</b>?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_193879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193879/#Comment_193879" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-24T08:52:21+00:00" title="February 24, 2009  8:52AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 24, 2009 8:52AM by tony_dowler.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I mentioned some other points of light in the sim wilderness.

It's demanding to play, but beautifully realized. It's biggest flaw is that it requires a huge time investment from the GM. Nevertheless, there are several games running, and new players are welcomed. One of the 10 finest games ever made, in my flawed opinion.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.hyw.com/" rel="nofollow">The Hundred Years War</a> is a sim heartbreaker. It's a simulation of the Hundred Years War laid over a huge database of hundreds of real personalities and places in Europe of the time. It does a bunch of things no other game does, but when last I tried it out, the UI was quick difficult. <br/><br/><a href="http://anywherebb.com/postline/posts.php?f=15&amp;t=409" rel="nofollow">Noctis</a> is a procedurally generated universe containing millions of stars, each with a full planetary system to land on and explore.

Sadly, computer-generated content tends to look and feel the same after a while (try playing DF in Adventure mode and talk to a townsperson to see what kind of challenges Tarn will have to face), so you still have to depend on the skill of the programmer to entertain and excite you.<br/><br/>What I suspect we'll see is the creation of computer-<em>mediated</em> content generation, where computers are used to generate the basic structure of the data, but finally relies on human beings to actually add the distinguishing features of the final resulting map.

And Tony, as usual, gets it right once again as to why the game is so fricking addictive:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: tony dowler</cite>DF does this progressively. The first time my Dwarf gets thirsty, I'm left wondering why he won't work.

So flying Dwarves applies, but also mundane things that the designer didn't think of or didn't code. DF isn't a great example of this, maybe, because part of the fun is trying to find a way to do difficult stuff (like trying to flood a chasm, or build a Fortress as an above-ground tower. DF Adventure mode is a much better example. If you're playing tabletop D&amp;D, and your character comes ot a river, you can imagine all sorts of tricky ways to get across it, including build a raft, make a boat, freeze the water with an ice wall spell, and so on. In a coded game, you can only do it 1) the way the designer intended 2) using some kind of clever trick or exploit.<br/><br/>The adaptive content, simply means the little things we do with our imagination to flesh out the situation. When the GM says that the goblin king is played by actor Steve Buschemi, or when we realize that the matron of the village just happens to by my character's aunt.<br/><br/>Again, in DF, part of the game is filling in the gaps with our own imagination. This is another reason it's such a great game. It turns the weaknesses of sim computer play into strengths. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_193907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193907/#Comment_193907" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-24T10:05:53+00:00" title="February 24, 2009 10:05AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The exploration and building and planning and randomness pieces of this are really appealing to me, but the accounting and state tracking and (especially) interface kill my brain with fire.

Sadly, computer-generated content tends to look and feel the same after a while (try playing DF in Adventure mode and talk to a townsperson to see what kind of challenges Tarn will have to face), so you still have to depend on the skill of the programmer to entertain and excite you.<br/><br/>What I suspect we'll see is the creation of computer-<em>mediated</em>content generation, where computers are used to generate the basic structure of the data, but finally relies on human beings to actually add the distinguishing features of the final resulting map.

It started when I designed a combat resolution system that was too time-consuming to do by hand, so I wrote a program to do it. Then I discovered Roguelikes, and my brain exploded. I never got it to work like I wanted, because I never managed to come up with content-generation engines that I was satisfied with. It's also a lot of work, much like I expect writing <i>The Burning Wheel</i> was.
