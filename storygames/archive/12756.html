We have a big group usually, and everyone was excited to play, so seven it was. No-one had played before except me, and no-one knew too much about it except what I had raved about and the bits of pieces read online here and there. Here's a quick summary of how it went, and how flexible this game seems to be.<br/><br/>It was after a huge dinner, some beers, and our first game of the day that we settled down to play Fiasco. I read the elevator pitch, some movie inspirations from the back, and we got right into it. I initially counted out too many dice to be rolled (28x2 instead of 28) so our setup wasn't as random as it could've been. Everybody got the hang of it real quick, and I didn't have to say anything for people to concoct elaborate conflicts, histories, and characters. People definitely loved the setup part, cause we got to give each other things that were hilarious and totally inappropriate, and I think everyone really latched onto being slightly mean to each other in a fun way.<br/><br/>So here's the characters we ended up with (in clockwise order around the table):<br/><br/><b>Jennifer Miller</b>: a parole officer just trying to do the right thing. she has a hatred of mexican immigrants due to the recent promotion of her partner, Estevez, and shared a broken police ankle monitor with...<br/><b>Cyrus Appleton</b>: a mild mannered gay serial killer on parole due to a technicality. Jennifer was in charge of overseeing his parole, and hadn't yet realized that he and his partner were manufacturing meth and distributing it out of the ice cream truck he shared with...<br/><b>Stacey Burgess</b>: the gay lover of Cyrus, blissfully ignorant of his killer tendencies. He manufactured meth and distributed it to the Chicken Hut employee that was...<br/><b>Ezekiel Cole</b>: a meth dealer who worked at the Chicken Hut by day. He wanted nothing more to humiliate a few cops with his brother...<br/><b>Jeddidiah Cole</b>: a semi trucker with a habit for speed (both kinds) who accidentally drove over his next door neighbor's mom as she was riding a segway out of their shared seedy duplex driveway...<br/><b>Susie Meldon</b>: neighbor to the Cole brothers and high school field hockey coach. She was infamous for tackling the star football player in a high school game who was her rival. He was also the one she was determined to get laid to prove a point to, and his name was...<br/><b>Larry Holcomb</b>: a registered sex-offender who was tackled by a girl. Turns out he had just lost a lot of weight, and forgetting to wear a belt to girls softball practice, his pants fell and he was revealed to the world. He also had it out for those dirty immigrants, and still had a beer after work with Jennifer Miller every day.<br/><br/>Act One<br/>Round 1:<br/>Play started with Jennifer (I did an example round). She went to visit her parole Cyrus and Stacey, and her partner Estevez let them fill out the paperwork after a promise of a good massage, so it went badly for her. Cyrus established his serial killer creepiness by deciding to sell ice cream to Susie's field hockey team (and get her address) and Stacey and him then traveled to the Chicken Hut to make a drop off with the meth to Ezekial Cole. They were spotted by a suspicious Larry, who always kept a set of binoculars on his person. The Cole brothers were driving home with the meth in their semi, got in an argument about which was better, meth or speed, which ended up with Jeddidiah driving home hyped up on meth and his brother Ezekial getting a new paying customer. Jeddidiah, currently on meth, decides its best to take his neighbor's dead mom's segway out for a spin (he had run her over on said segway!), and crashes it headlong into Susie's car. She gets out, freaking out that he ruined her car, and is that her dead mom's segway!? They call the cops, but Estevez blames it on Susie and shoots her dog in "self defense"  as she gets arrested. Susie flashes back to yesterday, when she had gone to pick up some paint from Larry's paint store, and subsequently convinced him that he should deliver it to her house while batting eyelashes. Larry then flashes back to the present to see Susie being arrested as he's delivering her paint, and starts a fight with Ezekial for getting her into trouble.<br/><br/>Act One<br/>Round 2:<br/>The next day Jennifer decides there's something fishy going on with those gay men and their ice cream truck, so she decides to break into it off duty. She gets inside, finds the meth, and just as she's turning to exit she sees Cyrus coming at her with an axe and the scene fades to black! Cyrus goes to visit Susie with flowers and a box of chocolates, but instead finds the fight ensuing between Jedidiah and Larry. He silently watches as things unfold, and once Larry is hauled away by the police he heads inside Susie's house unnoticed (flashback). Stacey sees Cyrus dragging Jennifer's body inside and freaks out, and for the first time, so does Cyrus, going all turrets for a hilarious bout of expletives and serial killer madness! Luckily, their friend Ezekial called and knew just what to do. He suggested they leave her behind a bar in an alley, with drunken sharpie drawings on her face and meth in her pockets, then call her partner Estevez to clean up the mess. He succeeded in humiliating the cops. Meanwhile, Jeddidiah, still methed out, heads next door to his neighbor's Susie's house (flashback again) only to be captured by Cyrus and brought back to his shed! Susie is in jail with Larry, and they have a heart to heart about how things just aren't what they used to be, and how it was so sweet that Larry came to Susie's rescue, even though he still secretly hated her for tackling him in high school. <br/><br/><i>Half the dice had been used at this point, so it was time for the Tilt! Stacey got high black and Larry got high white (all whites for the sex offender!) I think we might have used too many dice for this (we rolled the 14 remaining dice and assigned 2 dice to each for a total of seven) but I wasn't sure if it was that or we just had a bunch of people in the game. In any case, all the mayhem gave us great ideas.</i><br/><br/>Act two<br/>Round 1:<br/>Jennifer gets a good talking to by Detective Menendez and Estevez (played by people at the table, Estevez had become a hilarious trope by now) and they reprimand her for ruining a two year drug operation that was about to bust Stacey's ice cream truck. She gets suspended. Cyrus sneaks into Susie's jail cell and gives her a talkin to about how she's one of a kind, and nearly strangles her to death as she ironically call's for Jennifer to help her, but instead the Mexicans arrive on the scene and Cyrus is gone. Stacey found Jeddidiah in his shed, and bewildered, he went to get into his ice cream truck and it mysteriously blew up. Ezekial, not hearing from his brother for a day now, was investigating the paint drops outside his house when he passes out from the residual meth and fumes. He wakes up in the shed with his brother, both of them duct taped to chairs! Susie meets up with Jennifer outside the police station, and they resolve to do something about this Cyrus who isn't the model citizen they suspected, without realizing that Jennifer was on suspension! Larry gets released from prison, and goes to the Chicken Hut to frame the drug dealers by planting some meth, and he gives the police station a call only to discover that Jennifer's cases are being handled by Detective Menendez. He curses the day immigrants were allowed into the country.<br/><br/>Act two<br/>Round 2:<br/>Jennifer calls Larry and along with Susie they all drive out to Cyrus and Stacey's residence to concoct a plan to make those immigrant cops look like they're incompetent and actually solve the case! Cyrus is in the shed with the poor Cole brothers, about to torture them, when he hears the exploding ice cream truck, so instead he runs outside and falls to his knees, flashing back to better times with his lover Stacey. Stacey calls for Cyrus, not yet dead but a burning husk, and they say their goodbyes as Stacey flashes back to him getting into the van. Just before the truck exploded Stacey saw a note taped to the steering wheel in Spanish "The Mexicans control the drug trade in this town!" which Stacey couldn't comprehend because he didn't speak Spanish! The Cole brothers attempt to break free from their duct tape bonds, but Jeddidiah gets to the axe first, and once again high on meth, tries to cut his brother free but gets half his hand too! In retaliation, Ezekial shoots his brother in the foot, then cuts him free. A neighbor wanders into the scene, and Cyrus yells "That man with the axe just killed my Stacey!" and the Cole brothers, realizing they're being framed, chase down the street after the neighbor all bloody, shot and screaming with an axe. Susie Larry and Jennifer pull up to the scene, and Susie, channeling her 1997 football tackle, tackles Jeddidiah and keeps him from axing the neighbor. Larry, witnessing this, realizes after all this time he didn't hate Susie for tackling him in high school, he loved her! And they kissed as the ice cream truck exploded once more in the distance.<br/><br/>Aftermath!<br/>Officer Jennifer Miller got kicked out the force, arrested for meth dealing, and when she got parole her officer in charge was Estevez.<br/>Ezekial Cole bled to death from wounds his brother inflicted.<br/>Jeddidiah Cole, attempting to escape the scene of the crime, got run over by a semi delivering segways.<br/>Susie Meldon got her place fixed up and reserved a space for an assistant coach on the fieldhockey team: Larry.<br/>Larry Holcomb ended up in jail again, for some reason.<br/>Cyrus Appleton turned up to visit Larry in jail, and killed him stating "I could never kill a woman. I was after you all along!"<br/>Stacey Burgess was being laid to rest, but at the end of the funeral, a figure covered in a veil and in a wheel chair headed off into the distance with Cyrus.<br/><br/><br/><br/>So, this game took surprisingly the same amount of time it took at Origins with five players: about four hours total. I was thinking that seven people would be too many, but everybody incorporated about 3-4 players in each scene as we rotated around and it worked pretty organically. Everybody was involved the whole time! Another difference I noticed was that there were three or four plot-lines happening as opposed to one or two, so it was kinda more like in lock stock n two smoking barrels where you would have 3 or 4 plots with 2 or 3 characters attached to each. So we just juggled them and found ways to weave them together.<br/><br/>So, I guess all in all, I would do Fiasco again with seven players! It wasn't any more difficult to facilitate, and I think if it hadn't been the group's first time playing it would've moved along even faster. I was surprised how well it went!<br/><br/>This is the perfect game for our group. Everybody really, really loved it. We haven't had that good a time at a one-shot in like, 2 years, most people agreed. Thanks for putting out such a fun and quality game, Fiasco team!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286778">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286778/#Comment_286778" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-16T12:30:38+00:00" title="August 16, 2010 12:30PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry to be so pedestrian, but how long did your session run?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_286780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286780/#Comment_286780" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-16T12:36:48+00:00" title="August 16, 2010 12:36PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, it's at the end of my summary actually, about 4 hours total!

We usually do 12 scenes plus the overhead in two hours or a little less, which, as I reflect on it, is probably about the same pace - but I don't know how we'd keep up that pace for 28 scenes.

The large dice pool (half the total dice) just gives the two players more to choose from, and therefore a somewhat easier time finding just the right elements for the story.  <br/><br/>Don't kick yourself for not catching that though- it sounds like it worked just fine for your game, and it can be hard to ride herd on a bunch of excited gamers.  In one of the games I facilitated at Gen Con, the players had picked 5 Needs (instead of any other details) before I caught on to what was happening.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: anansigirl</cite>Also, in the Setup, were we supposed to apply dice from the pool to the number on the relationship, the type of relationship, and then the object/location/need category, and type of object/location/need type in order to use the whole pool?
