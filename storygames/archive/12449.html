I'm very proud of the scenario and it will be perfect for the dread system. <br/>\n<br/>\nA brief history of the scenario: A mass grave containing a few dozens bodies is discovered on a farm near Montreal. The government organize a special operation (Cougar) to deal with the identification of the bodies and to find those responsibles. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe characters: There's 9 units that forms Operation Cougar. The characters are of those units. I would like your input on the characters' questionnaire. I think it lacks a little something. There's no hope. How can I add some?<br/>\n<br/>\nCaptain Gaudreau (Provincial police corp)<br/>\n1. Why did you decide to come back from retirement to be part of Operation Cougar?<br/>\n2.

Why is it lucky?<br/>\n7. Why do you make it a point to always pay the alimony late?<br/>\n<br/>\nLieutenant Poirier (Montreal police corp)<br/>\n1. Why did you insist to be transfered to the hate crimes department?<br/>\n2. You acquired a particular skill in your delinquint youth. What did you learn?<br/>\n3.

There's some advice, but not enough for me to feel confident in making up good questionnaires.<br/><br/>Not knowing anything about the adventure makes commenting a bit difficult, too.  But these feel a bit generic, and not inspiring of enough drama.  You may try phrasing the questions more so that they indirectly establish facts about the character ("Why did you return from retirement?" does this pretty well, for example.)<br/><br/>You could tie them in to the scenario more fully (causing PCs to be involved with the killers or to have known some of the victims or something).  Or give one or more questions that push them in the Mythos/Delta Green direction ("Where did you first hear about the top secret spy organization Delta Green?" "Which family member became obsessed with an obscure South American death cult, and what did you do to try to save them?")<br/><br/>"Have you ever fired your weapon in the line of duty?" is sort of weak.  For one thing, it's a yes or no question, when you want open ended questions (this applies for some other questions as well: you want open questions, that prompt more thinking and explanation).  Worse, yes and no both seem to be unsatisfying answers.  It would be better if it injected more drama or character into the game: "Who did you wrongfully shoot in the line of duty?" or "You've never drawn your weapon on anyone.  So why do you regret not doing so?" or something would work better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_279709">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279709/#Comment_279709" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-08T12:38:40+00:00" title="July  8, 2010 12:38PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like your questions.<br/><br/>Many of the Dread questions have a sly wit to them. They also (sometimes) give you a negative characteristic, which you must explain.<br/><br/>So this has no sly wit or negative characteristic. It's like a question from Montsegur 1244, not Dread. It's purely information, with no emotional tug.\n<blockquote>1. Why did you decide to come back from retirement to be part of Operation Cougar?</blockquote>\n<br/>While this has a bit more sly wit, while giving me something seriously embarrassing.\n<blockquote>4. Why is there a restraining order on you?</blockquote>\nAlso (I could be wrong), I think the Dread questions generally connect you to other people. Again, note how the first question above doesn't, but the second one does.<br/><br/>I hope that's of some use. I'm slightly stabbing in the dark. Really, I like the questions that make me smile, which is hard to quantify.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/dr_pete" title="dr_pete"><img alt="dr_pete" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/dr_pete">dr_pete</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279806/#Comment_279806" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-09T10:12:02+00:00" title="July  9, 2010 10:12AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've played Dread, but haven't read the instructions for constructing these, but here's my thought... these put some fairly tight boundaries about who the character is, but they seem like they lack some oomph.  It may be in how they're phrased.<br/>\n<br/>\nCaptain Gaudreau (Provincial police corp):<br/>\n1. What is it about this case that drew you out of retirement?<br/>\n<br/>\nLieutenant Bouchard (Provincial police corp)<br/>\n1. What were you really doing in Bosnia in the 1990s for the Canadian Army?<br/>\n<br/>\nLieutenant Poirier (Montreal police corp)<br/>\n1. What special skill did you pick up in your criminal youth?<br/>\n2. Does it bother you that so many of the people you arrest come from the same background as you?<br/>\n3. Why was it so important to you to become a Homicide Detective, rather than some other police division?<br/>\n4. Why do you always play the "bad cop" when interrogating suspects?<br/>\n5. When they search your car, what will they find that might send you to jail?<br/>\n<br/>\nAgent Smith (FBI):<br/>\n1. What drew you into the study of serial killers?<br/>\n2. What's the freakiest thing you ever saw at a crime scene?<br/>\n3. Which common food will you never eat again because of one of your cases?  What happened?<br/>\n4. You were commended for singlehandedly bringing down the Toledo Torturer.  What did you leave out of the report on that confrontation?<br/>\n5.  Why did you fight so hard to get assigned to this case in Canada?<br/>\n<br/>\nCoroner LeChance (Forensics)<br/>\n1. When you were 10 your dog went "missing".  What really happened to it, and how is that related to your decision to become a doctor?<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's just a few ideas... hope they help!<br/>\nDr Pete                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
