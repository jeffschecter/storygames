I would call that literary.  HOWEVER, we set it in another area (Seattle, not Moscow), and since there were no canonical characters that showed up, or reactions to plots from the actual novels, I can not call it "literary roleplaying".  I would probably give it that title if the game was set in Moscow, with the appearance of (or roleplay of) major characters or plots from the book. But I don't think this counts.<br/><br/>* I've thought recently about using something like the Nemesis rules system to run a game set in the World War Z novels. That is, just like the vignettes in that book, the players too would take their characters into a mini-adventure for 1-3 sessions, then move on to the next set of characters elsewhere in the world for 1-3 adventures, and so on, basically roleplaying out similar vignettes to those in the books. Perhaps even being on the front line in the Battle of Yonkers. That would be "literary" IMO, but I haven't done it yet.<br/><br/>* And I can barely fit my head around roleplaying in "Great Literature", so I'd love to hear ideas or even stories from people who tried (and succeeded, or failed).<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_113632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113632/#Comment_113632" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-11T13:38:47+00:00" title="December 11, 2007  1:38PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>Remember the "Wuthering Heights" game?</blockquote>\nHas anyone ever played it?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Troy_Costisick</cite><br/>PS: Oh! and I played it too.

It is a near perfect example from my play sessions with Holmes and Watson.<br/><br/>WARNING: Long AP post coming-<br/><br/>I remember this so clearly because it was our 4th playtest and by now the guys were really up to speed on how the game works.  <br/><br/>So we stat up characters.  Dave plays a former priest, Mike plays a town blacksmith, and Rob plays a minor government clerk.  They\u2019re all living together at 221b Baker Street (since that\u2019s sort of the premise for starting play in the game).  I\u2019m the GM.<br/><br/>I have an opening scene where I have a young lady burst into their study on a late Sunday afternoon.  It\u2019s raining out (just to add some atmosphere).  She sits in one of their chairs weeping.<br/><br/>Dave: why is she here?<br/><br/>Me (GM):  yeah, why IS she here?<br/><br/>Mike:  She\u2019s lost her fianc\xe9!<br/><br/>That\u2019s all I needed to kick things off.  <br/><br/>Me: She says that she was waiting for her future hubby at the church.  His cab (carriage) arrived, but he wasn\u2019t in it.  The driver said he was certain the man go in the carriage, but swears he never saw him leave.<br/><br/>Rob: I can tell from the engagement ring on her finger, that the fianc\xe9 is a very wealthy man.  (totally made up off the top of his head, of course, but so are all the clues in this game.  This is very much like how Holmes noticed clues on his clients).<br/><br/>Dave: Her dress is nice, so it tells me her daddy is rich too.<br/><br/>Mike: So, does your fianc\xe9 have any enemies?  Who are they?<br/><br/>Me: Yes (which must be treated as the truth as per game rules).  His father owns a paper factory.  The men there don\u2019t like my fianc\xe9 very much.  They say he works them too hard.  And my fianc\xe9 had a scuffle with a bartender on Eighth Avenue last week.<br/><br/>Dave:  I see a bruise on her face (again, made up on the spot).  Did your lover hit you?<br/><br/>Me:  (I have to go with it, since Dave said he saw the bruise):  No, it was one of the \u2018ladies\u2019 that works for the barkeep.  She came over to my flat looking for my fianc\xe9 (we never did make up a name for him).  When I told her he wasn\u2019t there, she hit me and walked off.<br/><br/>Rob: Her shoes are muddy.  Did you walk here?<br/><br/>Me: Yes (of course this clue falls totally flat.  Just like something Watson would have noticed in Doyle\u2019s stories).<br/>Mike:  Why would that matter?  Elementary my dear, Rob (which is what someone would say any time someone offered a clue that went no where).<br/><br/>So I\u2019ll sum up what goes on for the next bit.  They get a few more clues from the young woman, then visit the carriage, bar, and Scotland Yard to get the police report.  This is all very much in keeping with Holmesian mysteries.  They observe clues at each location and collect evidence.  In this game, you have to collect a certain amount of evidence before you can finger a bad guy.  Dave, the former priest, visits his sister who is a hooker (irony, no?  made it up during character creation).  She gives him a crucial clue that gets the group closer to solving the mystery- much like the Baker Street Irregulars do in the stories.  They get close to nailing the bad guy.<br/><br/>Me: okay, you manage to locate Sailor John (the kidnapper).  He\u2019s in an old shanty down near the river.<br/><br/>Dave: Okay, I\u2019m brining my revolver.<br/><br/>Mike:  I\u2019m bringing my club.<br/><br/>Rob:  I\u2019m bringing Officer Brady (one of the police officers they had befriended in a previous adventure).<br/><br/>Me: Okay, you can see the shanty.  What do you do?<br/><br/>Dave:  Mike you go around to the back and make sure no one gets out that way.  Rob and I will go in through the front.<br/><br/>Mike:  Cool.<br/><br/>Me:  Okay, then what?<br/><br/>Dave:  We bust in and try to subdue him!<br/><br/>We roll some dice.  Rob gets injured pretty bad.  Dave manages to subdue the guy, and Mike apprehends his female companion that was there.  Eventually, they decide they find the fianc\xe9 locked in the closet.  It was a little more violent than I was expecting.  But, after I read the Sign of Four, I felt reassured.  Violence was used by Doyle in several of his stories.<br/><br/>It was just amazing to me, after reading more Holmes, how well our play sessions matched the spirit of those stories even though none of us were really pushing in that direction.  It just happened through play.  Andy, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019d call Doyle great literature (I happen to think he\u2019s great), but my friends and I had a great time.  Graham W also played the game once or twice.  You might want to ask him about his experience too.  But again, I highly recommend reading The Sign of Four to get a good feel of how the game looks.  Other of his stories are good too, as examples of what play is like, but the Sign of Four is a near perfect match.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_113644">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113644/#Comment_113644" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-11T14:09:10+00:00" title="December 11, 2007  2:09PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 11, 2007 2:19PM by Jarrod.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was thinking of trying to game loosely around Mark Danielewski's House of Leaves, taking the skeleton of the idea and breaking the different books down into layers. One player is the narrator, one player is the author, one player is the filmmaker, and a fourth player acts as fill-in characters. But, like your Night Watch game, the house itself, as well as Zampano and Johnny Truant, were absent, replaced by unique characters in a different setting.

This was a unpleasant surprise to them when the T-Rex could in fact see them when they were perfectly still. I liked it because it showed how woefully wrong paleontologist theories can be. The only big departure from the book was giving the velociraptors camoflage and voice mimicry (actually that might have been in the book, I forget). It was very railroady following the plot, but since everyone knew the movie, they knew it was pretty railroady and dove into it.<br/><br/>I even used the Palladium system.

I haven't played that particular one (Paging John Kim; John Kim to this thread please), but I've heard it usually turns out quite well.</blockquote>\nYou rang?  :-)<br/><br/>Yes, I've run the SFS Hamlet Parlor LARP three times -- the last time just a few weeks ago at AmberCon NorthWest (see my <a href="http://www.darkshire.net/jhkim/rpg/cons/acnw2007.html" rel="nofollow"><b>ACNW2007 report</b></a>).  I've also run their other adaptation, Snow White.  The Hamlet LARP particularly was a ton of fun.  Snow White was more mixed, though we also didn't use the rules as written.  Though Shakespeare was really meant as performance rather than literature, it is often taken as literature.  <br/><br/>I've never set an extended campaign directly within the situation of a written story, but I have frequently played games based on literature.  Usually, I take the written story or stories as a template for the genre, but the game is set in a different time or place than the events of the novel.  Like many others, I have played and run Call of Cthulhu games based on H.P. Lovecraft.  My Vikings &amp; Skraelings game was based closely on the Icelandic sagas, particularly the Laxdaela Saga -- but it doesn't really count since it's moved to an alternate history where the Vinland colony was successful.  I played a Lord of the Rings campaign.  My current campaign is based on Naomi Novik's Temeraire books, but it's set fifty years after the books in another country (Korea).  There was also my Conan scenario based on R.E. Howard, set hundreds of years after Conan's time.  <br/><br/>All of these have been a lot of fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_114224">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nicklessguy" title="Nicklessguy"><img alt="Nicklessguy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nicklessguy">Nicklessguy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114224/#Comment_114224" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-13T17:20:33+00:00" title="December 13, 2007  5:20PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 13, 2007 5:44PM by Nicklessguy.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Speaking of roleplaying based on - or rather in, for this was really the case - a pre-estabilished work of literature, last summer I was <a href="http://www.enstillamiddag.se/index.en.html" rel="nofollow">here.</a><br/><br/>Oracle of jeepform Tobias Wrigstad was in the staff, incidentally. And so were many other people known to the storygames community, and in particular to -nordics aside- John Kim, since a lot of them are in his Knudepunkt photos. To cite only the ones mentioned in this same thread, Martin Ericson was playing a luridly depraved Knut from Strindberg's <i>Playing with Fire</i> and Martin Broden was the GM responsible for my group.<br/><br/>Wonderful larp, great players, nice people, great after-larp party.<br/><br/>As for playing <i>inside</i> literature, at some points (mainly certain character monologues during the dinner, which made it into the larp quite verbatim) I had the very strong impression of being inside Vinterberg's acclaimed movie <i>Festen</i> (or <i>The Celebration</i>), which set the frame and scene for the larp. Tor Kjetil Edland played a wonderful Christian, and during a scene with him I had almost the same feeling I had in some dreams as a child, in which I befriended some characters of book or films I had liked. Which, as you can imagine, was good.<br/>I am - and also were at the time - very fond of other pieces of literature the larp was based on, particularly Ghosts and Miss Julie, but for them this magic just didn't happen. The overall experience however was very good, as I have already mentioned.<br/><br/>To leave nordic arthaus for my warmer south, I confirm Renato's say on On Stage, which is a big classic in italian non-mainstream roleplaying, although I feel I must add it has a very strong gamist/challenge flavour. I heard the visiting jeepers dug it nonetheless.<br/><br/>The other experience I had was indeed in part an experiment I did with a friend in ridding On Stage of this legacy, a little more than a year ago. What came out reminded Lorenzo Trenti, who witnessed a part near the end of the Modcon 2006 premiere, of jeepform. And this was maybe the case, since a little later the jeep independently put out Doubt, which makes some of the things we wanted from our game better. However, the game was based - as in "you play the protagonists of the original story," not "you can see it unfold on the background" or "we should aim for a similar atmosphere" - on italian best-selling novel <i>Romanzo Criminale,</i> with some elements from the inspiration of the author, that is the history of the infamous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banda_della_Magliana" rel="nofollow">Banda della Magliana.</a><br/><br/>(This post is badly written even for my standars.
