There's a whole XML Schema designed to address just that set of challenges: DITA. It basically breaks down any and all topics into three major types: concept, task, and reference.<br/><br/>But even THEN you have the issue of sequencing, but it's a bit simpler: concepts and reference can often do double-duty (e.g., simple GUIs in software); and often tasks are discrete and linear (e.g., wizards). But the most complex documents (i.e., those about the most complex applications or hardware) usually follow this general guideline:<br/>* Complete, super-high-level conceptual overview - how the parts fit together and interrelate.<br/>* Individual interface References, with associated Tasks - where do I go to do what I gotta do<br/>* Common major Tasks - typically, for those that require several touches in the interface, throughout the interface (i.e., it isn't "go here, click this" but more like "go to these fifteen places, setting these eight settings and providing these seven values")<br/>* Backmatter complete References without tasks - often as alternate materials, like quick reference posters, cheat sheets, and so-forth (and sometimes checklist reminders of major steps in complex tasks).<br/><br/>"Traditional" RPGs have, generally, a fair number of tasks to document (not counting subtle variations on the core tasks), a lot of concepts due to the games' granularity" or "verisimilitude", and a metric shit-ton of reference.<br/>"Story" games have, generally, a single task or maybe four or so to document, nearly no reference, and a shit-ton of conceptual stuff (typically to explain techniques that work with an otherwise system-light game).<br/><br/>So really.... there's no one way to answer your question; and until you analyze the data set of information that you need to convey--core concepts and their exceptions, inheritance of information structure and processes (i.e. consistency of both reference and tasks),  exceptional processes, and degree of look-up reference (where is the stuff I need to know in the book?) versus getting-bearings reference (where on the interface am I gonna see what this is talking about in the book?), and depth of detail in references--you won't be able to outline a TOC.<br/><br/>Often, a company will release two or more deliverables to deal with the challenges you seem to want to discuss: train well with book A, which is presumed to be basically one-off (possibly even destructible or customizable--e.g., a workbook); and leave book B to be utterly, only reference (MAYBE with a glossary for concepts and some checklists for tasks).<br/><br/>Does that sound like anything you've seen sold in RPG land? <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_392853">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392853/#Comment_392853" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-09T10:05:49+00:00" title="October  9, 2012 10:05AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All assuming, of course, that you are asking the two questions to do a comparative analysis, and not for an opinion poll. If the former, it will only bear fruit for you if your game very closely parallels others, I think. Not to say "unask the question," but just to let you know it might be faster to analyze what you've got to convey than to analyze several other product's communications needs, find parallels, and attempt to apply them to your particular instance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392905/#Comment_392905" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-09T13:58:44+00:00" title="October  9, 2012  1:58PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Often, a company will release two or more deliverables to deal with the challenges you seem to want to discuss: train well with book A, which is presumed to be basically one-off (possibly even destructible or customizable--e.g., a workbook); and leave book B to be utterly, only reference (MAYBE with a glossary for concepts and some checklists for tasks).</blockquote>\nThat actually seems like a very practical way to create game texts to me. Practical in overcoming the difficulty of making a single text carry both burdens, not necessarily in the time and resources required. It also sounds like a good model for those designers/publishers that want to get play, feedback, and word of mouth about their game going before it is released but are wary of releasing the full text to the public. You can just release the teaching version and hold back the reference version for release, or something along those lines.\n<blockquote>Tell me a little about the rulebooks that were a pleasure to read on the first sitting; or those where everything was really well arranged for ongoing use during sessions.</blockquote>\nTechnoir comes to mind. Part of that ease of reading and ongoing use is due to its minimalist design aesthetic but I also think Jeremy (and Will) did a really good job of organizing and presenting the information. \n<blockquote>Conversely, tell me about those that you really struggled to get into; or those which were absolutely shocking to use as a reference during play.</blockquote>\nThe Apocalypse World book worked fine for me as a reading text but not at all as a reference text. But with the content of Playbooks and the other reference sheets you can use during play I don't really think the book was meant to be a great reference text.<br/><br/>The actual aids used during play of a game is probably another component of all this. If they're done well and have the right information on them you almost don't need the book at all. Great play aids go a long way towards teaching a game and keeping things flowing once play begins, regardless of the state of the core text.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_392973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392973/#Comment_392973" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-10T05:21:31+00:00" title="October 10, 2012  5:21AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That is great feedback, David. I've done a little study regarding manual-authoring and reference documentation; not a whole lot, so I didn't even think to compare the two fields of writing. It makes perfect sense to do so, and to bring in the lessons from that field to the projects I'm currently considering. <br/><br/>Thankyou.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
