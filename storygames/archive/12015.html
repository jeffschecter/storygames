For D&amp;D that is an easy one, start by introducing it as a chose your own adventure and start building it from there. I have a copy of the OD&amp;D escape from Zanzer Tem's salt mines and I can modify that to fit the game.<br/><br/>But how would you do that with The Mountain Witch?<br/>To me it seems a bit more difficult of a task. In D&amp;D I think presenting the player with situations where you increase the number of options until you just start taking your lead from the player is fine. With The Mountain Witch I think it would have to be a more self conscious introduction of the different techniques and ideas of how to use the fates and Trust.<br/><br/>Thoughts?<br/>I may also run Prime Time Adventures if you want to comment on how to do a half hour intro to that one as well.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Erik_Battle" title="Erik_Battle"><img alt="Erik_Battle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Erik_Battle">Erik_Battle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268890/#Comment_268890" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-25T18:02:25+00:00" title="April 25, 2010  6:02PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know how computer games start with this tutorial and you do like one thing at a time?  Here's how you move, now move around the world.  You can run like this, jump like this.  Now pick up this gun and fire at that target.   <br/><br/>I wish more tabletop games would do this.  Introduce the material by playing it one piece at a time.  I know RPGs/Story Games have these complex interactions, but it would be good to get experience in one aspect before moving on to the next.  As it is, we generally throw a ton of rules at someone and then expect them to take it up and know how to play a game.<br/><br/>To specifically answer your question, I don't know Mountain Witch at all.  PTA, it would be neat to lead people through different types of scenes, tutorial style, but still allowing them to play the game as you go.  Maybe a series of minigames that last a total of 30 minutes but teach the rules.  Figure that out and I think it would be gold.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_268894">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268894/#Comment_268894" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-25T19:39:14+00:00" title="April 25, 2010  7:39PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've played a fair bith of TMW in convention setting, and I have to say that I mostly just start playing - players pick it up through play. My first act (or whatever the frame of the trust mechanics is called in English, I forget) is short and usually just one or two scenes at a tavern.<br/><br/>In fact, here's my typical introductory layout <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, <b>The Inn</b>:<br/><br/>There is a small inn near Mount Fuji, one that used to service mostly pilgrims to the mountain. Now the place is dirty and nigh-abandoned, dark and grim due to the deprecations of the Witch. The clientele consists of poor farmers and goons of the Witch. The inn-master is thoroughly compromised and likely to sell any worthwihile intelligence to the Witch's minions, or even point them out so they can be attacked at night. The weather is foul here most of the time, dark and rainy, with mud splatters over everything.<br/><br/>Begin play by picking a couple of likely ronin and tell the players that their characters have arrived here after a long journey at night-fall. Ask them whether they met on the road or just happened to the inn at the same time. Let the players establish their characters. When they get into the inn, you might tell one more player that his ronin has already arrived and is nursing a drink inside. Allow free roleplaying. Bring in more ronin if you have them until everybody's present in this last shard of civilization. Entertain the players with sullen farmers and aggressive gangbangers whose tattoos flare obviously to claim allegiance to the Witch. Have NPCs plot in an obvious manner in dark corners, and should any ronin decide to be frank about their mission, have the peasants and inn-keeper be suitably impressed. Then, once everybody's had an opportunity to establish their characters in the fictional space (what they look like, where they are, whether they're doing something) run an introductory conflict: some peasants get offended by a rude ronin, or gangbangers overhear somebody slighting the Witch, or something like that. Something like three enemies, for three dice.<br/><br/>Teach the conflict rules to the players. Allow them to have their characters cooperate, but do not bother to encourage it yet. Allow the characters to situate themselves towards the brewing conflict freely: some ronin might take the opportunity to defend another samurai against the lower classes, for example, which is a time-tested form in this genre. Others could step in to neutrally arbitrate, only to get caught in the conflict themselves. Notably, whether win or lose, the ronin or ronins in the conflict clear the situation handily; the GM opts for damage instead of success at this point, so the ronin might get injured, but he'll drive the offenders away. Depending on the particulars of the situation this might impress the in-keep or even garner his gratitude if the troublemaking originated by wrassling the inn-keep (another typical form of the genre).<br/><br/>The goal of this act is to have the players introduce their characters and have the characters do something. To this end, use direct questions: ask the players whether they want to have their characters introduced to each other, ask them what they will or won't reveal to each other and so on and so forth. Some particularly messed-up players will prefer to have their characters stay in the shadows and keep their secrets from the others; tell such players that they might be missing out on the fun, but it's their choice. Typically such a character follows the others the next morning at a safe distance and then either joins the others to save them from a tight spot or gets into trouble himself in the next act, necessitating rescue.<br/><br/>If the players are taking to the act well and it seems like you'd like to kick it up a notch after the above developments, tell the players that the first, introductory act will end in the morning, and where will their characters sleep. Then ambush them in the night: careful characters are allowed to conflict over noticing something, but failure or not having a care leads to the characters awakening to an explosion: somebody's blown up the side of the tavern, and soon black-clad imperial soldiers are among them, trying to capture them. They're armed with Gaijin weapons, including the bomb they used to break down a whole wall of the building. Lord Ebert Ravenstone, a gaijin ally of the Witch, strides among the dark figures in the light of the burning building, his pale Melnibonean face reflecting degenerate bloodlust and will to power.<br/><br/>Remember that in TMW, it's not your job to coddle the players. There are something like 15-20 attackers, but the night is dark, the situation chaotic and the information Ravenstone got from the escaped gangbangers was contradictory and misleading. At this point teach the players the truth: lone ronin are screwed, but Trust will allow them to escape. Make it clear that fighting to the death is not an option under the rules: Ravenstone himself is a Strong (or whatever the term was, I forget) NPC, while his goons are many; killing them all would take many, many rounds of successful conflict. It's more likely that the ronin will opt to escape to the dark woods, hide in the burning ruins of the Inn or even talk themselves out of the situation; Ravenstone doesn't actually know anything, unless somebody had loose lips earlier, and even then it's easy enough to claim misunderstanding and perhaps represent some accreditation.<br/><br/>After all that, end the act and explain the Trust mechanics to the players in full. Have them adjust Trust for the events of the last act, and begin your actual first act in the morning, as the ronin climb to the mountain. All told the above should take about half an hour and allow the players to learn the game in simple and low-stakes conditions. You have plenty of time to explain the conflict mechanics, for instance, in that first conflict.<br/><br/>My alternative introductory act is <b>The Warg</b>, but I'll leave it for now - I think the basic principle comes out there pretty well. TMW is one of the easiest roleplaying games out there, so an introductory act will take care of any teaching even better than it would in some other games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268999">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268999/#Comment_268999" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-26T12:54:02+00:00" title="April 26, 2010 12:54PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am unabashedly stealing that prologue and using it next time.
