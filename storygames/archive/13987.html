You can just try to take out your enemies, but it's often smarter (and more interesting) to use your maneuvers to succeed at those Achievements. Some grant you a victory condition for the conflict, others boost your attacks or lower the enemy's defenses, and some unlock interesting story avenues.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_316979">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Davide%20Losito" title="Davide Losito"><img alt="Davide Losito" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.webinprogress.it/allyraid/badtoro2out.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Davide%20Losito">Davide Losito</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316979/#Comment_316979" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-17T15:16:40+00:00" title="March 17, 2011  3:16PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Or, add consequences to the game's world, according to the fight results.<br/>Have you killed the dragon?

Depending on the circumstances, the people around the table might get the most fun out of a grueling battle where their utter defeat is likely, or they might just want to cut loose and show off how awesome their characters are by beating fifteen different kinds of snot out of some hopelessly outclassed cannon fodder.  They might want to have to choose between several different goals, or they might want a climactic final showdown.  They might want a fast-paced fight where a lot happens in a very short span of real time, or they might prefer to slow down and do the whole thing in "bullet time."<br/><br/>Basically, if you're the one who's generating the opposition and setting the scene for these fights, everyone will benefit when you correctly identify what kind of combat is going to be the most appealing right now, and can quickly adapt to it.  Sometimes you can get a sense of this from how everyone is playing before the fight starts, or from how they start a fight, or even (horrors!) by asking them questions about what they like and don't like.<br/><br/><br/>But I do agree with a lot of what's been said so far, and think that most of the advice given is so broadly applicable as to be nearly universal.  Especially Mcdaldno's "design each encounter with unique goals" and JDCorley's "Location, location, location!" because those right there are wonderful ways to make every fight memorable and meaningful, instead of just being another goddamn generic 10x10 room with 2d6 kobolds.  I think it's fun to have more choices available than "who are you attacking?", so anything that expands the possibilities of the combat scene (do you try to close the gates?  do you set off the sprinkler systems to try and short out their laser guns?  do you challenge their leader to single combat?) works for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_316987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316987/#Comment_316987" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-17T16:08:56+00:00" title="March 17, 2011  4:08PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 17, 2011 4:14PM by John_Harper.">edited March 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a vexing question.

"Combat" is just too broad a term I'd say, the sort of stuff that's fun in one game will suck in another. <br/><br/>But zooming in on your post you seem to be after combat that's both a) roleplay-full* and b) doesn't include a complicated and/or gamey subsystem? <br/><br/>Based on that my first instinct is to say Apocalypse World (yeah, yeah, know) because when combat starts you don't really break pace or engage any special subsystems (ok, there's the Harm roll which is kinda problematic). One moment you're talking to a dude the next you're shooting him in the knee and it all flows together. Have you played AW and if so how was that for you?<br/><br/>*(I know this might be a pointless/nit-picky/offthread question, but when you say "doesn't involve much role-playing", what does "role-playing" mean to you, exactly? Because it's not really a homogeneous term, even if we use it like it is all the time.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_317007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317007/#Comment_317007" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-17T17:24:14+00:00" title="March 17, 2011  5:24PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with John as well.  There's no easy answer to your question.<br/><br/>However, I recently came to a realization about my own personal preferences concerning combat that might mirror your's, Ewen.  I discovered that I need a certain amount of <i>story </i>every few minutes or I get bored with the mechanisms of the game.  That is, I need to see the situation change in an interesting way.  If thirty minutes pass and the only thing that's happened is that the monster is halfway down on HP and I'm low on arrows, that's not enough for me.  And that means that nearly every gritty, time-consuming combat system out there won't work for me anymore.  The only exception that I can think of is DitV, where resolution might take 20 or 30 minutes, but the situation changes so often that I remain entertained.<br/><br/>So, now I make combat not suck by either playing games that don't have long processing times in their resolution, by playing games that offer dramatic situation changes as part of their resolution, or by hacking the shit out of the game I'm playing until it meets one of the previous two criteria.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_317011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317011/#Comment_317011" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-17T17:44:36+00:00" title="March 17, 2011  5:44PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Speaking from a purely dramatic - may not work for every game - perspective\u2026<br/><br/>- Opposition that's a credible threat.

That, to me, is the critical part in making non-sucky combat scenes:  to figure out what (if anything) you find enjoyable about playing out a fight scene, and then adjust whatever needs to be adjusted (setup, mechanics, pacing, whatever) in order to get more enjoyable stuff and less sucky stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_317039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317039/#Comment_317039" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-18T01:00:35+00:00" title="March 18, 2011  1:00AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 18, 2011 1:12AM by TylerT.">edited March 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            my advice to players is <br/>pick the right game.

That makes sense, it's dramatic and scary.<br/><br/>But then again I suppose there's little attrition: you're lucky if you survive your first wound, and then you just better hope you don't get hit a second time.

When the ogre is forcing us off a ledge. When we know reinforcements are just around the corner. When we care about how much attrition we suffer now because we need to be able to fight later. Have the bad guys use interesting tactics. Have the environment change and shift (think of any good fight scene from the Star Wars movies, all those spinning blades and moving parts). Have emotional reveals change the player's perceptions of who they should be fighting, or what they're fighting for. There are so many millions of things you could do to keep the players engaged as a GM, not to mention all the things you can do as a player to keep yourself engaged: take risks, try unusual tactics, push the boundaries of the mechanics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_317080">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317080/#Comment_317080" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-18T12:04:02+00:00" title="March 18, 2011 12:04PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nolan,<br/><br/>Are you intentionally attempting to tell me what I like in my gaming?

Also, what games have you been playing where the combat is boring you?</blockquote>\nI have played both of those, though probably not as much as I'd like. In particular I've only played a convention one-shot of AW, so I don't have a good sense of how the MC brings conflicts to bear. I've run a mini-campaign of Mouse Guard though, so I have a much better sense of how its conflict rules necessarily slot into the overall course the game takes.<br/><br/>The games that weighed heavily on my mind for this though were D&amp;D4e and Swashbucklers of the 7 Skies, though each for very different reasons. 4e makes using its combat rules an enjoyable activity in itself, but it takes work to make combats fit into the story in a meaningful way. While there's a lot to like in S7S, it has the kind of combat system that to me doesn't have much to offer as a game per se, and thus it felt like it took a lot of extra work to make combats actually be interesting. It wasn't hard to make them relevant to the story, but the rules didn't help with that either.<br/><br/>I definitely do need to work more on how I utilize existing games in terms of making battles (and other conflicts) be about something, and having the actual process go beyond a simple slugfest, but I also want games that lend themselves to that a bit more naturally than some of the ones I've been playing.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: migo</cite>Not suck for whom?

But for myself, I want combats to be pitched battles with lots at stake and reasons to keep shouting and role-playing all the way through.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_318024">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318024/#Comment_318024" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-28T18:14:06+00:00" title="March 28, 2011  6:14PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I thought Id revive this thread as it has some relevant stuff in it about changing the situation during combat which relates to a problem Im having.<br/><br/>Please see this cross-post at the forge<br/><br/><a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forge/index.php?topic=31367.0" rel="nofollow">how to make certain actions have a basis in fiction</a><br/><br/>Any ideas appreciated.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_318025">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318025/#Comment_318025" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-28T19:14:15+00:00" title="March 28, 2011  7:14PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would like to underline what Mcdaldno said: the goals of the combat should not be the killing of the other side.

You just say that when characters are at 0 hit points or incapacitated or whatever, it means they are hurt but not dead. Sure, Riddle of Steel doesn't really work that way, but most games do.<br/><br/>Then, after the fight is over, you have a bunch of groaning, injured folk on the losing side. And now you have to deal with them in some way.<br/><br/>If you want, that can be turned on and off as the situation indicates. Basically, if either the GM or a player wants to have further interactions with the defeated, then they are available for that.<br/><br/>The nice thing about having NPCs that persist after being defeated is that it lets you defeat your players without killing them. The PCs can be scared off or captured or whatever, without being killed.<br/><br/>I'll make a comparison to LARP again, as I often do. In many live combat larps, characters that are defeated in combat end up unconscious and bleeding - if they bleed for 5 minutes without being tended to, they die. This makes it very difficult to defeat the players without killing them off. Other systems avoid this problem by saying that if you are defeated, you are incapacitated for 5 minutes, after which you regain your last hit point and you're OK again. This means that you can beat up the PCs pretty good without unintentionally murdering your entire campaign with a badly statted encounter. It doesn't mean that the players are immune to death - while incapacitated they can be murdered relatively easily. But giving an NPC license to finish someone off is separate from just defeating them in a fight. If you want, you can have NPCs try to capture a couple PCs. Or take some of their stuff. Or other things that add more to the story than killing people off does.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_318201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318201/#Comment_318201" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-30T12:44:11+00:00" title="March 30, 2011 12:44PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd love to see a system by which, when you reached some degree of combat failure then your fate was sealed.  Initially, you could just walk away (e.g. at full HP).  As your group becomes more heavily wounded, you have to roll successively harder number to break off combat and escape.  At some threshhold you lose the ability to break off combat - you either surrender, suicide, etc.  The trick would be making it a whole party deal, perhaps past 40% total HP for example with 80-40% requiring a roll to escape.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_318234">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318234/#Comment_318234" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-30T17:30:26+00:00" title="March 30, 2011  5:30PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Doesn't sound like something that would make sense in many circumstances.

It would end the back and forth of combat 40% sooner in a trad style game.  Because it gets harder to break away as you approach that threshold, players have an incentive to break off combat even sooner - like one might do in a real fight.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
