Not everything in the game was awesome, but this thing was.<br/><br/>Gorkamorka is a miniatures skirmish game, in the 40K universe, with Orks.  Basically, you create a gang, with trucks and motorcycles and really big guns, and you want to kick the crap out of the other guy.  You can play it as a campaign, with a downtime system.<br/><br/>Got that?  Okay, the cool bit:<br/><br/>In downtime, you could send characters to the doctor.  Usually wounded ones.  And the doctor would mess around with them, randomly; the doctor was a series of tables, with "you pick" as a fairly common but not universal option.  You might send someone in for a leg wound, and have them return with a cybernetic jaw.  And yes, I'm aware how dumb that might sound, at first read.<br/><br/>But something <i>always</i> happened, and it was <i>always</i> something cool.  The people I played with locally at the time would send as many of their guys as they could out to the doctor, and basically gamble with them, to see what cool thing happened next.  This was often a very bad tactical choice, but it was hilarious and crazy and fun.  Really heavily tactical players would have just one guy they'd send out, and name him "Guinea Pig" or something like that; if he sucked, kill him off; if he rocks, he can stay home and the gang can name a new test subject.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what the takeaway design lesson is from that.  I'm sure there is one, just not what it is.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_180792">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180792/#Comment_180792" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-29T16:50:51+00:00" title="November 29, 2008  4:50PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Random tables are actually fun in and of themselves?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180793">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180793/#Comment_180793" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-29T16:52:53+00:00" title="November 29, 2008  4:52PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All games are improved by the phrase "gyro-stabilised mono-wheel"?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_180796">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180796/#Comment_180796" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-29T17:03:43+00:00" title="November 29, 2008  5:03PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>All games are improved by the phrase "gyro-stabilised mono-wheel"?</blockquote>\nVery possibly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180799/#Comment_180799" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-29T17:38:45+00:00" title="November 29, 2008  5:38PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Maid RPG has rekindled my love of random chargen and event tables.

Uggh.<br/><br/>I also loved how if you wanted to switch your orks out of their positions as the driver or gunner on a vehicle, the new ork had to beat them in a fight.<br/><br/>Basically for me the fun of the game came from the inhabitants of this world not reacting mechanically to me. The Doks wouldn't do what I wanted to do. The orks in my gang wouldn't even do what I wanted to do. There was even a mechanic for an ork getting too big for his britches and challenging for leadership of the gang whether you liked it or not. Sometimes this little internal skirmishes led to fatalities.<br/><br/>It was definitely not a game for control freaks but man oh man was it fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_181423">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181423/#Comment_181423" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-03T21:04:58+00:00" title="December  3, 2008  9:04PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The basic game ended up too much like "Truck Jousting" for me.  We'd spend ages just getting into position for a pass at each other's trucks.<br/><br/>What made the game was the "Race" game we made up, with the terrain scrolling 12" every turn, and the person who made it off the far table edge first being the winner.  Motorbikes would race off ahead at the start, only to be gunned down.  The other vehicles would jokey for position the whole game, trying to get ahead.<br/><br/>The other game type we loved was "chicken".  Two vehicles start facing each other, and drive towards each other each turn.  There's a leadership test to see if you swerve away.  First to swerve loses.  In the event of a head-on collision, it's last orc standing.  I won that with my leader standing atop the corpse strewn wrecks of two trucks, swinging hs power axe.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
