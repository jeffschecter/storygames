That said, there have never been any true heart-breaker campaigns I've been in. There have been ones where terrible, terrible things have happened, but that's always been middle-game threat rather than end-game sadness.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_314207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314207/#Comment_314207" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-25T11:44:26+00:00" title="February 25, 2011 11:44AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was thinking about this at IndieCon.

The players had inadvertently caused about fifty or so children to die horribly painful deaths. At the end of the scene, there was this moment of silence and everyone just sat there, looking devastated. We took a break after, and I thought I was going to lose some of my players. I didn't, but that moment has been referenced again and again by the players when we talk about emotional playing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a player, the few times I've felt like crying or getting upset was because of how my character was feeling. We've recently been playing Grimm and it's getting very dark and frightening for children. As a ten-year-old girl, I had a fight with two of my friends and then was comforted by 'ghosts' that had revealed to my character that a bunch of children had become hollow. Between the terror of her investigations (most of her friends didn't believe her) and being abandoned by her one true friend (he threw meat at her and she's a vegan), in character I was ready to cry and out of character, I felt so horrible for this little girl. I find I get emotionally 'in-character' really easy, so getting 'teary' or upset because of a game happens more often than not if the game is doing its job.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_314222">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jared%20A.%20Sorensen" title="Jared A.

The game is focused on the deaths of close friends, so it is easy to go into tears when playing it.<br/><br/>And I've cried in my modern contemporary game <i>A Poem for Mr.Morning</i>, as a player. It's about a family, with tough issues, so tears are often close to the surface. Working on a rewrite of that game now.<br/><br/>I'm not one to cry much in my daily life. I believe it is years since last time. Reckon I'm too happy. But I find it a bliss to have games turn up the emotional heat, and have no problem letting those emotions flow into my character-play.<br/><br/>Edit: cried in the funeral of my sister this fall, and in the funeral of my mother last spring.

Right before the game, the player playing my husband came up to me, telling me it was his first game, how nervous he was, and how happy he was to have someone in the game he could trust. I quickly started to feel bad for both the character *and* the player and when the affair was inevitably brought to light both of them looked betrayed. That made me cry a few hours later, after the game had finished.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_314367">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314367/#Comment_314367" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-26T04:41:57+00:00" title="February 26, 2011  4:41AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 26, 2011 4:42AM by TomasHVM.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: zephyr</cite>I remember a LARP where I played a wife who had been cheating on her husband with his brother for years.

But once i ran a homebrew game about the players learning to experience/control their dreams.  They were all 'awakened' by an event in game at their place of work, a Safeway.  The last session of the game was not an epic battle between Nightmares and 'Dreamrunners' (what the game is about) but a conflict between the third shift manager (one of the PCs) and their biggest antagonist:  a horrible bitch named Courtney that was the second shift manager.  An elderly woman who had been with them the whole time, and the only one that didn't love the fact that they were now awakened dreamers, was standing behind the player as the two girls finally lost control and started shouting at each other.  It was in that moment that the older woman had a heart attack and dropped onto the floor.  I still remember narrating the sound of her landing on the tile and how the PC didn't look away from me, she kept eye contact, so obviously infuriated by what Courtney was saying to her (Courtney had just tried to fire the old woman for unfair reasons).  The rest and majority of that session was scenes at a hospital, with the old woman dying.  Meeting her family for the first time.  And then having the doctors tell them she didn't wake up, she had passed away.<br/><br/>The part that made us all cry was the short, necessary last scene.  Where the dreamers all fell asleep at the hospital, while waiting for an answer.  When they went into their dreams, to the same Safeway where they worked (only now shaped and transformed into a sort of wonderland) the aisle where the old woman worked had suddenly been uprooted by a tree that grew out of the roof and into the sky several stories high.  It was filled with a treehouse (the character had always wanted to build one for her grandchildren) and throughout the treehouse were photos of her life, from childhood to the last moments.  At the very top, in a small room with her work things, there was a photo of the whole group of them from third shift.  It was a photo that could not exist, and no one ever took it, it was imagined.  And there was a note.  I wrote the note in real life, and handed it to the PC who had tried to defend the old woman from Courtney.  She couldn't read it, and handed it to another player, already choked up.  He read it, and we all teared up.  It said, "you were right, we were meant to do this."  In her dying moments, asleep before she truly left, the old woman really learned to embrace her dreams, and made this huge, awesome thing, a great tree in the midst of their struggles, and a treehouse bigger than she ever could have put together in life.<br/><br/>The fact that i based the old woman on a friend of mine who had been fired from my work for seriously depressing (economic) reasons made it especially hard for me not to get involved.  But the funny thing is:  i didn't cry at the game.  I cried when i wrote the game notes before hand.  I knew it would come to this.  I planned it out.  And it made me sob.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_314475">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314475/#Comment_314475" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-27T00:52:28+00:00" title="February 27, 2011 12:52AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            cry?  in front of people? <br/><br/>the only table top games i have known people to cry over is pokemon (little kids losing) and warhamer 40K <br/><br/>the game that effected me the most was watching deaths door.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_314478">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314478/#Comment_314478" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-27T01:36:29+00:00" title="February 27, 2011  1:36AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TylerT</cite>cry?  in front of people?</blockquote>Yes, Tyler.

I cried at the final episode of Cowboy Bebop. Twice. I cry at the end of Babe every time, ditto Iron Giant, and Disney's Mulan chokes me up at several spots. I'm sure there are a bunch of more grown-up movies I've cried for and am forgetting; as a father the kid flicks are looming large in my brain(though I'll defend each and every one of those movies, as stories, if I have to.)<br/><br/>I'm trying to think if I've cried for any books or comics. It seems like I must have, but it's hard to recall; those media don't jerk the heartstrings quite as viscerally as a motion picture.<br/><br/><br/><br/>So, the topic at hand:<br/><br/>For video games, I misted a bit at that moment in Final Fantasy VII; in actual fact I screamed "no!" and dropped the controller. it helped that I was a shipper for the love interest in question. It was the first time I'd ever been moved by the story in a video game. Later I went back and played Final Fantasy VI, and there are certain characters and plotlines that are emotionally moving for me., moreso than VII for sure, but I never quite got teary. I think, again, that the medium isn't as visceral; the emotional beats in that game are delivered by expressionless 16 bit sprites, whereas in VII the graphics aren't near as lifelike as modern games but they're at least animated.<br/><br/>I cried at the end of Xenogears. The very end had a nice "daaaaaw" triumphant moment (with the perfect song for it), but what REALLY moved me was just before the endboss: the two main characters have an actual sex scene, in cel animation no less, and it's a perfect, human moment where they come together for comfort in the face of their respective nightmarish issues, and to experience a taste of life and joy before going off to fight GOD for the fate of a beleaguered post-apocalyptic humanity. It was remarkably sophisticated and artistic for video game plot.<br/><br/>I think I've cried for another video game or two, but can't place 'em at the moment. It's definitely not often.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Several story game experiences have made me cry. Not bawl, but definitely tear up. At PDX Gamestorm last March, I played both <a href="http://storybythethroat.wordpress.com/2010/03/31/tragic-trajectories/" rel="nofollow">DitV and Apocalypse World with Vincent</a>, and in both games I played a character who was full of compassion but causing those she loved pain. The first was Sister Eleanor, whose steely determination to make things right couldn't assuage a grieving father's bitter despair. We actually narrated the characters sobbing and sobbing together, and I thought I was going to lose it. The second was Cybelle, a transsexual Brainer who was in love with our beautiful Savvyhead Jessica, who was also loved by the Hardholder Esco. Cybelle Unnatural Lust Seduced Esco to get him to let Jessica go, and in the resulting coital Deep Brain Scan learned how badly she had broken him. In both these games I credit Vincent with the talent for really inhabiting and humanizing these grieving NPCs. The look in his eyes and the soft tone of his voice really brought home the emotional reality of the characters and gave me something really rich to play off of, and get swept up in the emotion myself.<br/><br/><a href="http://storybythethroat.wordpress.com/2010/07/16/montsegur/" rel="nofollow">This game of Montsegur 1244</a>at Go Play NW last year got me, when I described my character, Pierre Roger, taking his infant daughter in his arms for the first and last time. It got me in my tender place as a new father, and also Pierre's estrangement from his wife (which was why he hadn't held his daughter until now) struck a chord with me about some relationship problems I was having. It was a raw moment where the game eerily mirrored some real life concerns and made the emotional impact of the scene much more vivid and real.<br/><br/>So those are my stories. It doesn't happen every time there's strong emotion in the story, but if the stars align--intense players, deep focus, a conducive environment, and a game that socially structures play <i>just so</i>...I'm a sucker for that stuff.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_314639">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314639/#Comment_314639" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-27T23:58:37+00:00" title="February 27, 2011 11:58PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice stories, Joel!

But I remember when a player did.<br/><br/>I ran a zombie apocalypse larp. I did the scene. You know, the scene. It's in like every zombie movie. You meet a character. You like the character. They get infected. They turn zombie. You have to put them down.<br/><br/>It worked. The woman playing a medic who was trying to treat her when she died and came back lost it. I honestly didn't think it would have that much impact. I was kind of just doing it for genre sake. But I guess there's a good reason why that scene is in every zombie movie. It's the scene that works. It's the thing that makes zombies resonate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_315030">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315030/#Comment_315030" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-01T19:36:59+00:00" title="March  1, 2011  7:36PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: dreampunk</cite>When I played Seth Ben-Ezra's A Flower for Mara a few GenCon's ago, it had a profound effect on me.
