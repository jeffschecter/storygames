And in this genre game, there's this skill list and background list that help support the general feeling of the genre.  Whatever the skills are, they're flavorful and important.  That's just a given here, I don't want to discus that really. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>So, In Prep:<br/><br/>1.\tTalk about what the group will look like within the setting.  What kind of characters will they be? What kind of relationships will they have?  Talk about where and when you met/ will meet each other character.  Lines and veils, etc. You know, the whole expectation thing.<br/>2.\tYou get 6 points to spend on the skill list.  Assign them.<br/>3.\tTalk about some times you used those skills.  Maybe leave one or two as cliffhangers. Maybe tie-in another character.<br/>4.\tYou get 4 more points for the background list. <br/>5.\tTalk about your character's goals.  Long term or short, achievable or not, pick some goals.<br/>6.\tYou get 2 points for each other player. Assign them to a skill for that character, chosen from the "edge" list.  That is, you are deciding for that character what his next 2 points are spent in, with the group character design as input.  It stays on your character sheet, not theirs.<br/><br/>In Play<br/>*      In conflict (or whatever) roll dice, highest die wins, ties are discarded, move down to the next highest dice.<br/>*\tWhen you use skills or backgrounds, you roll white dice.  When someone else uses the trait you assigned them, you may give them 2 black dice.<br/>*\tBlack dice are mechanically more potent than white dice.  They break ties rather than being discarded.<br/>*\tRather than boosting stats with exp, the reward mechanism could force another player to rewrite their trait for you, but having no influence on what they can choose.<br/>*      Each dice pairing is described in the fiction by the players contesting.  Uncontested dice are like if you won a pairing.<br/><br/><br/>What I'm thinking of is a game where instead of "guess the GM" being an emergent thing, "guess the group" is a mechanically enforced/encouraged thing.<br/>The gradual release of skill points is supposed to be a thing that encourages a meshed feeling between the players by interlacing their character's designs.<br/>The fact that you assign skills to your self, but "edges" to others is intended to get you more heavily invested in the other guy's dude, rather than your own, maybe. <br/>The potency of edge dice is, you know, obviously meant to encourage players to do things the other players want. <br/>The reward mechanism idea is included so that you have some control over changing things when an idea is getting stale.<br/><br/>Just a little idea.  Is there something like this already?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323260">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323260/#Comment_323260" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-05T22:20:35+00:00" title="May  5, 2011 10:20PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Reading through this, looking at your question, and then reading through it again...<br/>I swear I've seen some games that have a few similar concepts, though maybe not entirely in the same way...?<br/>I see a little bit of Apocalypse World, a bit of Hot War/Cold City (or is that the other way around???), and a bit of Remember Tomorrow.

And the game design itself is based around your relationships to the other characters.  Check it out if you haven't.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
