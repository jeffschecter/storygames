As one engineering professor told me "at the time, it was a solution looking for a problem". To my mind, this is the more pure form of invention (and the most gratifying, when someone takes your invention and does something with it you never intended).<br/><br/>I'm curious about similar ideas in games: gaming inventions that sit around without a specific purpose, waiting for someone to make use of them. Along these lines, three questions:<br/><br/>1) Have you ever built a gaming "laser": an idea you didn't know what to do with, but someone else used to good effect?<br/><br/>2) Have you ever used someone else's "laser"?<br/><br/>3) Can you identify any unused "lasers" lurking about in the gaming sphere now?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273285">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Queex" title="Queex"><img alt="Queex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Queex">Queex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273285/#Comment_273285" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-27T07:33:20+00:00" title="May 27, 2010  7:33AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            2) A friend came up with a mechanic for samurai combat by rolling dice at the start then spending them for attacks and ripostes. It was cute, but it could only handle one-on-one confrontations, and some of the considerations for range and weapons were a bit fiddly. He wasn't sure whether it was better for an RPG, a wargame or some other table-top game. A few years later, the very basic idea became the central mechanic for Rivers and Lakes; now with multiple combatants and stunts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273287">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273287/#Comment_273287" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-27T08:31:09+00:00" title="May 27, 2010  8:31AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have a directory full of lasers.

That stuff!<br/><br/>Also, I think that it has the potential to cause a paradigm shift in how adventures get designed in advance by GMs. Instead of a simple set of tasks, some location descriptions and a bunch of stats for adversaries, the GM's job would be to come up with something more like a complicated flowchart, with different branches for each possible interaction between objects, people etc. in the players' environments and particular point spends. This would be much closer to how the plots of some types of computer games get designed - old Interactive Fiction games like <i>Zork</i>, for example, or point-and-click "adventure games" like <i>Myst</i> and <i>Grim Fandango</i>,<br/><br/>I have a crude, untested intuition that GMs who relied on prefab adventures might be motivated to engage in a much more imaginative, freeform style of play if the Gumshoe system ever got used in the way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273401/#Comment_273401" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-28T00:26:10+00:00" title="May 28, 2010 12:26AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For a while, I think the biggest "laser" was Otherkind dice. <br/><br/>One current laser, I think, is Ron Edwards' Flashpoint system.
