A whole bunch of shit explodes about being too nice on Story Games and I have jack and shit to do with it!<br/><br/>Until now, I guess. <br/><br/>This is crazy. Three or four years ago, an average Story Game-type person either bought or was VERY famililar with, say, 80-90% of the games available in the scene, maybe more. While there certainly were instances I know about where person X thought person Y's game sucked, and kept hush about it, there were also many, many instances where person X contacted person Y and said "Hey, this is what your game needs to improve." And then Y went on to publish Dust Devils or Conspiracy of Shadows or TSoY or MLwM and so on.<br/><br/>Today, it is basically impossible to own all the games. I'm pretty sure it's impossible to know about all of them very, very well. And, I know for a fact it's impossible to play them all. This is great! It means we have to start making choices as hobbyists about what we want to spend money on, and especially about what  want to get around to actually playing. It also means someone's gonna lose that choice, consistently, and fail to succeed.<br/><br/>We actually have a market! It's tiny and it's prone to weird burps. But, it's working! It means that publishers will have to get their shit together to survive. Someone remarked in today's threads that a game might suffer if people critiqued it. <br/><br/>Um, GOOD!<br/><br/>Games do not deserve to survive <i>because they are creator-owned</i>. Games deserve to survive <i>because they are valuable games</i>. Thinking otherwise is poisonous to everyone's success. Only a little bit, I imagine, but then we're little, aren't we?<br/><br/>I get it. It's messy. Toes get stepped on. Our market is so frickin' tiny that our publishers are simultaneously our customers. If a game can't survive Graham bitching about them, then that game didn't deserve to survive in the first place. Fix it or get it off the teeny-tiny market. We don't owe you publisher status. You have to earn it based on the merits of your work.<br/><br/>Many of my publisher peers long ago said we determine our own success, whether it was just getting in print for free or making a zillion dollars. I can't see <i>anyone</i> who defines success as inadvertently avoiding criticism because others are afraid of hurting your feelings.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84688">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr" title="Kevin Allen Jr"><img alt="Kevin Allen Jr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr">Kevin Allen Jr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84688/#Comment_84688" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-01T10:53:30+00:00" title="August  1, 2007 10:53AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here Here!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_84689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21" title="Ken Sentowski!"><img alt="Ken Sentowski!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21">Ken Sentowski!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84689/#Comment_84689" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-01T10:54:46+00:00" title="August  1, 2007 10:54AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Preach it brother Snyder!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84706/#Comment_84706" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-01T11:17:25+00:00" title="August  1, 2007 11:17AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also note, a game's "survival" in the indie mindshare is not necessarily a failure as a game.

It's what <b>other</b> Internet forums do. I don't want smack talking of any games - storygame or otherwise - on SG, uh huh, no siree.<br><br>"Smack talking" is stuff like:<br><br>"This game sucks because elves are phoney"<br/>"This game uses too many dice"<br/>"We didn't have any fun playing this game"<br/>"Everything just ran slow and Paul fell asleep"<br/><br/>"Critique" is good. That's what good, supportive forums do. It's helpful on every level. If people on SG didn't critique, I would not hang here.<br/><br/>"Critique" is stuff like:<br/><br/>"I'm not a fan of elves, and I felt the game text focused too strongly on elven culture."<br/>"Prepare to acquire a whole bunch of dice of different sizes and colours for playing this game. I thought it was too many and would have preferred a more streamline resolution mechanics. It felt a clumsy in play because of the sheer volume of dice that had to be matched up against each other."<br/>"Our group felt there was too little direction in the game and we were flopping around trying to come up with cool story lines, but failed. A bit more setting information would have benefited us greatly, I think."<br/>"The GM was going on very little sleep and since the game placed a lot of narrative power in the hands of the GM, it really depended on the his high energy to keep the game moving along quickly. It fell flat that time so I can't really give you much feedback. I will let you guys know if I get a chance to play it again, this time a little earlier on in the convention schedule before everyone runs out of caffeine."<br/><br/>Just like many of us are working to becoming better game designers, we all have to work to become better critiquers, players and designers alike. We have to know when it's <b>us</b> that's the problem, when it's the <b>mechanics</b> that's the problem, when it's the <b>text</b> that's the problem, when it's the <b>layout</b> that's the problem. We have to be honest when critiquing and we do not own the game, have not read the game, have not played the game, played the game with people we don't like, played the game with people who aren't gamers, and so on. <b>Set</b>, what state you're in and your mood at the time, and <b>Setting</b>, what environment you are in, play a large role in our enjoyment in experiencing anything. I know I would have a much better time playing D&amp;D with a bunch of typical storygamers (as I know them) than I would playing Dogs in the Vineyard with a bunch of typical D&amp;D gamers (as I know them). Being aware of these factors and stating them is the cornerstone of any fair, unbiased, constructive critique.<br/><br/>Like many designers on SG are awfully humble about their games (with exceptions as needed), I think they're also painfully aware of this in themselves - they've already had to deal with people who smack talk games with no consideration to the above caveats. Not wanting this fate to befall their fellow designers, they (falsely, I believe) assume that they may make the same mistakes. But they are the least likely to make those mistakes, because they are more aware of the subjects than anyone else.<br/><br/>It's not an "honesty" thing at all. It's a matter of "are we qualified enough to accurately transmit why we honestly didn't like this game". If we are, then we should do it. I've previously purchased games based on the fact that people whose opinions I do not agree with accurately transmitted to me why he hated the game.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_84741">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84741/#Comment_84741" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-01T12:11:42+00:00" title="August  1, 2007 12:11PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt: Amen brother.<br/><br/>Joshua/Keith: I agree with both of you.

But yea, having succeeded in publishing in an environment where the investment to do so isn't much of an accomplishment. What's important is the choice to share, however that sharing is expressed.<br/><br/>Tony: Yea, criticism only works if people aren't walking on eggshells. You need to be honest. And sometimes honesty is painful, or poorly received.<br/><br/>lachek: Sure, the explained criticism is better. But the unexplained criticism is valuable also. If everyone is saying "Foofum sucks because it requires $100 worth of dice to play." You learn something. Somehow the marketting of the game went wrong (perhaps the author didn't realize that the number of people who have a backpack just for their dice is pretty small, or perhaps the author didn't realize most people pay about a buck a die, not the dime he pays, or perhaps the author was just a shill for Dice Are Us). Talislanta did very well on the "and no elves" slogan (never mind that it had it's own collection of humans with funny colored skin and pointy ears...).<br/><br/>For the hobby to be an effective market, we need a linked market of games AND of critiques, reports, and opinions of games.<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84743">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84743/#Comment_84743" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-01T12:15:56+00:00" title="August  1, 2007 12:15PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Keith Senkowski</cite>In this day, where it is really easy to get shit in print, just publishing isn't awesome.</blockquote>\nYou are quite right, Keith, and I should have been more elaborate: writing, polishing, and publishing a game that you are proud of -- that's awesome.

These are not my opinions (necessarily) nor his (necessarily), nor necessarily a correct interpretation.<br/><br/>\xc2\xb7 how scenes in prime time adventures focus on your character\xe2\u20ac\u2122s goals. When I played the game I got annoyed because there were other things in or surrounding the scene that were more interesting to me than character goals.<br/>\xc2\xb7 I didn't like how PtA had a single conflict/stake pair for a single scene, because our scenes were filled with interesting things to have conflicts over. My character was in the scene for a reason, but I would be OK with losing those immediate stakes if I could only guarantee that I would win narration rights for the scene.<br/><br/>\xc2\xb7 How the otherwise elegant my life with master and dogs in the vinyards re-legitimized weird dice in indie rpgs.<br/>\xc2\xb7 I think MLwM and DitV could easily have modified their mechanics that didn't involve oddly-shaped dice, and still achieve the same effect. Having to purchase all those dice means that the buy-in effectively doubled for me, and I was not happy about that.<br/><br/>\xc2\xb7 The subject matter/color of trollbabe and title of panty explosion, which by being resonant of sexual fetishes [at least ones I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m not into], made me not want to buy the games.<br/>\xc2\xb7I'm not much of a sexual fetish guy, and these games centre on that. If it's your cup of tea, you'll probably enjoy it more.<br/><br/>\xc2\xb7 The \xe2\u20ac\u02dcanti-golden rule\xe2\u20ac\u2122 in timestream which says: 'every rule in here has a purpose, and if you aren't having fun playing with those rules, maybe this isn't the game for you.'<br/>\xc2\xb7 I thought the 'anti-golden rule' in Timestream seemed elitist. I understand what they're going for, but I'm certainly more qualified to make decisions for my gaming group than the designer is, and I would have preferred if they had soften up the language a bit.<br/><br/>\xc2\xb7 The dice pools in donjon make combat take too long<br/>\xc2\xb7 Donjon dice pools make even a simple combat a chore - our group of four spent 45 minutes hacking away at three goblins! We found it worked a lot better when we [whatever] but that had [somesuch] detrimental effect on the rest of the system. If you don't mind lots of dice rolling and extended combats this isn't going to matter to you much, but our group likes fast paced combats with minimal dice rolling and found the system to be substandard for running larger combats without heavy modification.<br/><br/>\xc2\xb7 Burning empire\xe2\u20ac\u2122s tight focus \xe2\u20ac\u201c I want multiple modes of play/mini games given its length<br/>\xc2\xb7 Burning Empire is written to tell a certain story that fits a certain setting. If you know and love the Iron Empires graphic novels this is the game for you. I have not read them, and would have preferred to use something like Ridley Scott's <i>Alien</i> as a setting instead, but the rule system is so closely intertwined with Iron Empires you really can't. Luke, maybe you could publish an "Empire Burner" supplement?<br/><br/>\xc2\xb7 Fudge dice in general since they seem to cancel each other out so why did I roll?

The conversation went like:<br/>me: "What does Harry Potter do that is groundbreaking? That changes things?"<br/>him: "Nothing. That's the point of the books. It's all derivative, stuff that's been done before. But it's entertaining."<br/>me: "So then what would be the point of me reading it?"<br/>him: "I told you. It's entertaining."<br/>me: "But I've already read it before? In other books?"<br/>him: "Yes. But it's a good read. You can read it quickly."<br/><br/>And on and on it went. The disconnect was this:<br/><br/>me: "I read slowly. I have a ton of books on the shelf, books I have been recommended as breaking new ground and expanding one's world view, but I have not had a chance to read them yet. My time is very valuable."<br/>him: "I read very quickly. I constantly run out of things to read and I get bored. I like to read new stories that deal with familiar subjects, so I can keep turning pages and lose myself in the story. I have lots of time on my hands to do that."<br/><br/>I couldn't see his viewpoint. He couldn't see mine.<br/><br/>Look at any best seller list and you will see books that are by anyone's standards derivative, but well marketed and accessible. Not "good", in some objective, qualitative way. Not groundbreaking or original. Like Joshua says, there is no correlation between quality and sales (perhaps you may even argue there is a negative correlation, but that is a touchy subject).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_84773">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84773/#Comment_84773" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-01T13:31:32+00:00" title="August  1, 2007  1:31PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            lacheck,<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn't mean necessarily that the unexplained criticisms were useful for the end user.

Firstly, as you say, there were so many games I couldn't keep track: do I buy <i>Perfect</i> or <i>Primitive</i> or <i>Intergalactic Cooking Challenge</i> or <i>Lacuna</i>? Like you, I think this is great, but it creates its own problems.<br/><br/>Secondly, I bought games I'd seen posted about, and they weren't very good.<br/><br/>Now, this happens with films (movies), too. And the way I decide which film to see is by reading reviews. I know, for example, that I trust the Times reviewer; that the Guardian reviewer is usually OK but likes pretentious things that I don't; and the Telegraph review isn't much use.<br/><br/>So I started writing reviews. They're coming slowly, because they're playtest reviews. But I do think critical input is important, because it helps you differentiate between the multitude of indie games out there.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_84913">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84913/#Comment_84913" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-02T06:26:45+00:00" title="August  2, 2007  6:26AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Calvino</cite><cite>Posted By: lachek</cite>there is no correlation between quality and sales</blockquote>What is quality?<br/><br/>Quality is subjective. It's meaningless to try to specify the relation between quality and sales, because quality is immeasurable. It means different things to different people.<br/>Joshua describes what he means by that - <i>utility</i> is subjective, while <i>quality</i> is, as you say, largely immeasurable and meaningless. One person's idea of "quality" literature is so different from somebody else's interpretation that conversing about it is nearly futile. On the other hand, when you use the word "utility" you filter your perceived quality through your wants and needs as a person, and it becomes easier to communicate about it with people of different utilitarian needs. However, once you start including "my wants and needs" into the equation, you have to accept Joshua's statement - "quality", as defined by the work the author put into the piece, has no correlation to sales. This is why, when art is produced on the corporate level for the exclusive purpose of profit maximizing, you rarely see any groundbreaking, mindblowing works - they understand that the current market generally wants things that are easily digestible, and make their art for the purpose of selling straight towards that utility.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_85110">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ihmcallister" title="ihmcallister"><img alt="ihmcallister" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ihmcallister">ihmcallister</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85110/#Comment_85110" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-02T15:20:25+00:00" title="August  2, 2007  3:20PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am completely for constructive criticsm, the key word there being constructive.

And I'd like to believe that some of the criticism I've given out has resulted in people producing better games. It's certainly been considered more than once. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe key to this is in having a place where you can criticize and know that you are intended to do so, and that the people who are there to recieve the criticism actually want it. The Forge, in other words (at least when I was posting on it regularly a couple of years back). And few other places I've seen. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, as an individual, there's only one thing you can do, which is to both give and recieve criticism well. But I think that's enough to make it valid to use online. Yes, sometimes people will react badly to criticism... so that makes them... human? You just have to ignore these people.

Despite all the people on SG saying "criticize my game, and make it HURT!", there's always someone who doesn't actually want to be poked with a pointy stick. <br/><br/>Of course I've seen instances where criticism works - but usually only when that criticism is articulate and well thought through (as when I reviewed Universalis or posted about Mridangam). And that's sort of my point: It's a lot of work being a good critic, and I only want to put in that work for games where I feel the author/designer has done their best. If I suspect or perceive sloppy work - lack of playtest, bad writing etc - it pisses me off, and I don't feel like getting thoughtful and reflective; I feel like saying "dude/dudette, you're a lazy f**k and you robbed me".<br/><br/>And that's a valid statement. But making it just isn't going to get me anything in return except a pissed-off designer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_86018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GCC40" title="GCC40"><img alt="GCC40" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GCC40">GCC40</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86018/#Comment_86018" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-07T02:43:57+00:00" title="August  7, 2007  2:43AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Criticism is a necessary evilthat any games designer/writer has to face, there simply is no way of avoiding it. A lot of it can be ignored as simple trolling and rebutted point by point. A lot of it can be very entertaining to read as well as informative.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome games do deserve well aimed brickbats. Character Gen/Combat systems that make no sense, missing tables and information vital to the running of the game inferred but not there. Book binding that will disentegrate as soon as you pick the book up.<br/>\n<br/>\nA designer then, its fair to say that you setting yourself up on a pedastal awaiting plaudits or tomatoes. If the criticism is harsh from just about every angle, then its not a good idea to put it down as simply "they don't get it" but time for you to look at what you made a little more closely.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if you are a designer who posts for reviews here in the hope that preaching to the faithful will be safer, makes me think you've missed the point of seeking criticism.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
