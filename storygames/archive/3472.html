Specifically, it's the Stunts. I know that some Stunts may not work so well feel-wise for Tribe 8, and that there are probably some new ones that might work well. I just can't really think of them right now...my brain goes into standby when I start looking over the Stunts.<br/><br/>So does anyone have any suggestions? Keep in mind that Synthesis, Sundering and Technosmithing are all pretty well covered. I'm looking at more mundane Stunts. I'm thinking this might be something that winds up having to be adjudicated during a playtest.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_78306">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick" title="Andrew Kenrick"><img alt="Andrew Kenrick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/145/415482171_321214bd7c.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick">Andrew Kenrick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78306/#Comment_78306" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-28T02:46:47+00:00" title="June 28, 2007  2:46AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you gone through the existing stunt list and crossed off the ones that don't work?

In fact, I've converted or found existing equivalents for every single Synthesis or Sundering Aspect or Technosmithing Formula. It was a good effort, and that's why I think that I'm kind of at a creative roadblock right now.<br/><br/><cite>How about having a go at making some archetypal Tribe8 characters.

I've already put in stress tracks for Spirit and Supplies (basically a variation of the monetary stress track Fred Hicks suggested in a thread on RPG.net) and I wanted to use Stunts (besides the Synthesis Stunts) for the social aspects.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite>I'd like some high level Magdalite style stunts that let you give someone a permanent or semi-permanent aspect of "in lust with me."

Over the weekend I'll likely start cranking some characters out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
