<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite><br/><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>I'm probably mixing things up here. But I see some Pseudo Play activities (like drawing characters) as building investment. And possibly an element of immersion. I've seen a few people create their own lifepaths in Burning Wheel or multiple characters as a way to immerse one self in the potential fictional environment. Of course this can be unhealthy when intended for group actual play as you may be immersed in something completely separate from everyone else.<br/><br/><b>I've also seen a few story games (usually people running them more so than the specific rules) almost treat non conflict role play as Pseudo Play as well. I've seen battle cries to get to the heart of the conflict asap. Start in the action. Jump to the next scene and cut to the conflict.<br/><br/>Is any of this related?</b><br/><br/>Edit: I've also felt a vibe of tension between general escapism vs. full on emotional engagement. Maybe it's related to Sim vs. Nar/Gam? I'm sure I'm completely messing things up now! Hahahahaha.</blockquote>
I don't think that fits in this discussion, but I would LOVE to see it in a new thread because I have thoughts on this, too. I have seen this trend too, and consider it, "Yes, that is certainly <b>one</b> way to play."<br/><br/>But again, that's a different topic. Wanna go for it? I'm about to leave work and won't be online to start it up for a few hours at least.<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>Rock! Andy, take it away! Anyone, please feel free to jump in as well.                </div>

                            I had a similar experience in my group. I divide game-play into "action scenes" (framed by the GM) and "personal scenes" (framed by the players), but I set things up so that the personal scene had to end in some kind of conflict. The players complained that the personal scenes were too confrontational and sometimes they just wanted things to develop without using any mechanical resolution. We agreed to allow personal scenes to come to a "natural" resolution, if everyone involved felt no formal conflict was necessary.<br/><br/>Natural resolution has a downside as well, though. A few of my players are good at talking themselves out of trouble, so they frequently ended their scenes "naturally" without any conflict at all. However, I am using the opposing stakes to drive the story forward. The "natural" resolution often meant I had no follow up and no real idea where the player wanted to take the story, since they never formally said what they wanted.<br/><br/>I haven't found a way out of this impass yet, other than discussing the issue with the players and emphasizing the role of conflict stakes as a way of telling me (the GM) where they want things to go. To compensate, I've pushed them harder to frame scenes properly, so I get direction at the beginning of scenes. We are still using "natural" resolution, but I push harder on players that seem to be excessively conflict shy.                        </div>

                            Paul, <br/><br/>I've found that if you have a game that heavily rewards the use of system in ways that matter players will tend towards a more balanced approach. For example, in the Bitches game there were several non-conflict personal scenes, but over the course of the game those started including personal conflicts that went to system -- but it was players calling on system rather than me imposing it on them. <br/><br/>If there are good reward based reasons to go to system and the players still chose not to then it's worth considering if they have good reasons for doing so, based on their goals and payoffs.                        </div>

You also get different results in a system that lets you do meaningful mechanical stuff that <i>isn't</i> about conflict.                        </div>

                            I've seen a lot of non-conflict play in chat environments, much more than face to face.  People will just hang out with their characters and shoot the shit forever.

                            I've seen this in Vampire games, where there was sort of an unspoken rule that play was divided into "just roleplaying" -- i.e., just talking, and stuff actually happening, which tended to be rules- and combat-heavy.  There was a strong pressure not to step across that line unless everyone was ready for it.  I remember once my guy was chatting IC with a Gangrel PC about how the Gangrels were really smart 'cause they had the best tricks, and I got shushed for invoking rules during roleplaying.  I miss that game, despite the dysfunctionality.<br/><br/>I've seen it in Story Games, too, like PTA, where a player wants to play out the whole scene from start to finish, no conflict roll needed.  It's fun, but it feels like playing basketball without the hoops somehow.                        </div>

                            Brand, Tony... brilliant. <br/><br/>I also want to underline Tony's point that the issue of conflict doesn't have to be an issue of game mechanics. You can 100% have players engaging in game mechanics in scenes with no conflicts. The Wrestling game I'm working on has two types of scenes. Getting Over and Fighting. Getting Over is building investment in your character, their goals, feuds, and future fights. They often will have no conflict but still involve lots of game mechanic effects. Fighting is where the conflict explodes, informed by and properly invested in by the scenes that came before it. <br/><br/>Andy, I've had most of these issues come up in PTA as well. Or rather, I should say I think conflict heavy scenes are often appropriate for PTA and for modeling certain types of TV. But often a lot of players who love PTA try to apply the same scene framing to other games where it may be less appropriate. <br/><br/>In PTA, when a player frames a scene, they declare the scene's focus (to develop a protagonist or advance plot), agenda (what the conflict may be), and location. Then the GM (producer) takes this info and describes what the audience sees to start things off. Then let's the player take over. You are actively encouraged to push toward conflict. If there is no conflict, the GM should create one. The earlier the conflict the better. And if there is no conflict, players should put a halt to things and say, "what's the conflict?"<br/><br/>But I feel like the second you say "what's the conflict", the momentum and emotional investment derails. If we have to ask that, then I don't think a conflict is worth having. And I suspect the issue is less with scene framing and more with buildup and investment.                        </div>

In Vampire LARP this is often taken to extremes, where play becomes a cycle of "so what do you do?" "jolly good!". The point being that because there's no way to impact change on the fiction, folks get locked into one long exposition scene. It's this that many story games rail against, and so really hammer home the conflict thing. I largely see that as necessary to hit the middle ground between the two, unless you hammer home the difference, people snap back to ingrained habits really easily.                        </div>

                            Now there are genres in which all-conflict, all-the-time is pretty appropriate (he says, defensively looking at the conflict-heavy comic book game he wrote!)<br/>
<br/>
If you're playing a scene where the Avengers get together for their weekly board meeting, it is <b>totally</b> appropriate to say "So, what's the conflict here?  Who's giving who grief, and why?"  It's the freakin' <i>Avengers</i>.  That's what they do.<br/>
<br/>
Contrariwise, there are genres in which player vs. player conflict (including player vs. GM) is rare to the point of vanishing.  If you wanted to model (say) <i>Survivor</i>, almost all of your scenes would be the low, simmering "foreplay" that Andy's talking about.  Love that phrase, BTW.                        </div>

                            I agree on the need to find the balance between "foreplay" and "conflict", with the usual caveats that the right balance depends on the players, the group mood, etc.<br><br>I also think it is useful to think on what each element contributes to the gaming experience. I believe my players enjoy the "foreplay" part of the scene because of the immersive experience of being their character. The conflict mechanics can definitely jar you out of that. Also, the conflict mechanics are often confrontational, and my players want some character-to-character interactions that are not confrontational.<br><br>I find that conflict is necessary for the reasons other people identified: it drives the forward story and helps you decide "what happens next" when there is no clear resolution to an interaction. I think this is important because if <b>all</b> your interactions have a clear resolution, the story is likely predictable and uninteresting.<br/><br/>For me, conflict resolution also gives the players an "out of character" way of expressing which direction they want the story to take. This is important, because it isn't always easy to indicate what you want in character. Also, sometimes player-interests and character-interests are not the same. That's very common for me as a player; I generally want my own characters to suffer.<br/><br/>I also agree, as some people have commented, that conflicts don't <i>have</i> to be confrontational. Or more accurately, they can have cooperative elements as well as confrontational elements. My players complained that "We are spending all our time arguing with the NPCs", so I worked with them to craft conflicts that have them cooperating with some friendly NPC against another, unfriendly NPC. That way, whether they win or lose the conflict, their characters can still bond with the friendly NPC, which is what they wanted.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt</cite><br/>In Vampire LARP this is often taken to extremes, where play becomes a cycle of "so what do you do?" "jolly good!". The point being that because there's no way to impact change on the fiction, folks get locked into one long exposition scene. It's this that many story games rail against, and so really hammer home the conflict thing. I largely see that as necessary to hit the middle ground between the two, unless you hammer home the difference, people snap back to ingrained habits really easily.</blockquote>
I agree.  In my own GM'ing, I've really struggled with this.  I'm totally comfortable with the foreplay and the explosition and the simmishness of it all, and then either people get bored with it (if they are wanting more conflict) or things start getting weird because the exposition gets pushed further and further with no resolution.   <br/><br/>This reminds me a bit of my central conundrum when trying to write a novel: a novel that's all plot is a thriller; but a novel without plot is unreadable.                        </div>

<p>I think you're focusing too much on actual face-to-face confrontation as the definition of "conflict". Let's say I'm playing a loser teen. I don't want to work or go to school, I just want to read comics and go to the movies. But my parents probably don't agree with this plan, and certainly society doesn't. That's conflict.</p>

<p>Foreplay? Conflictless?</p>
<p>I think this kind of play is important enough that it needs to be named as something other than <em>a conspicuous absence.</em> There are places where, genuinely, I feel like I need a peaceful scene that isn't impinged upon by the collapsing card-house of conflicts it inhabits. It seems weird to talk about it like it's an abnormal or even unusual kind of thing.</p>

                            Well, typically in the 'slacker' games that I do, I never do much with society or outside forces trying to make the characters do things against their lazy will, and I agree, when I do, that's pretty obviously conflict. The fun of it is interminable in-character conversations about nothing.<br><br>But I think the thread did crystallize what the conflict is for that game: it's the genre expectations vs. the characters' actions.
