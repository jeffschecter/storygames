                    I'd like to set up a website. Since I know very little about doing this, I'd really appreciate some advice. For example, how would I choose a web hosting service? Does it matter whether I choose a UK-based or US-based host? (The US one is likely to be cheaper).<br/>
<br/>
And, in the future, I'd like to look at writing an online game of some sort. Is this something I should think about while choosing a web host? For example, if I wanted a database on there, is that something I need to think about now?<br/>
<br/>
Any advice is massively appreciated.<br/>

                            That was an incredibly (and irritatingly) general query, so let me add a couple of things gleaned from a quick web search.<br/>
<br/>
I think I'm looking at a Unix-based hosting thing, with 24/7 support, 20Mb-ish disk space and the ability to use a MySql database. Does that sound about right? Is there anything I've missed? Any potential pitfalls?<br/>
<br/>
(As I understand it, the advantage of using Windows would be that I could use things like ASP and FrontPage extensions. And again, as I understand it, PHP can do most of what ASP can do anyway.)<br/>
<br/>
I think using a US host would be OK. It's cheaper for me, because the dollar is low against the pound at the moment. As I understand it, using a US host would make it quicker for US-based customers to access the website. Again, is there anything I've missed there?<br/>
<br/>
When I say "online game", all I'm talking about is some sort of database-backed thing with a bit of dice rolling and the ability to chat to other players. I think I can do all that with PHP and MySql, but tell me if I'm wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Is there anything I've missed that I need to consider? Anything I've got drastically wrong?<br/>

                            I'm not a web-guru or anything, but I do know a little about this, and since I'm also relatively new to it, I'm coming from your same point of view. In the process of getting my website up last year, here are some of the things I've learned about the process:<br/>
<br/>
1) Storage, Bandwidth, and Price. These are probably going to be the first things you notice as you shop around for hosting services, and you're going to want to make sure you get what you need. Also, see how the hosting services handles it if you exceed your bandwidth for a given month. Some of them will shut you down until the next month, some will charge you for the next highest bandwidth allowance, some ask. Know upfront if you think that might ever be a possibility. <br/>
<br/>
Just for reference, I pay $7.50 a month for3 gigs of storage and 25 gigs of bandwidth, neither of which I've ever even come close to exceeding, but that's just me. <br/>
<br/>
2) Tech support. If you don't know a whole lot about setting up a website (not creating one or writing html, but actually getting it online), you're going to want to make sure your hosting service has good tech support that's easy to get in touch with and helpful. This was the biggest learning experience for me. If the host you're looking at has a forum, scan it for tech issues. See how many get resolved and how quickly.<br/>
<br/>
3) Services. Yeah, if you want to set up a database you're going to want to make sure they'll be able to support it. This will probably be listed upfront. I lucked out as mine has supported everything I've tried to add or try out so far. <br/>
<br/>
As far as location, I don't think that makes a big difference, but there may be people who disagree with me. My hosting service is in Florida, I'm in Indiana. That in and of itself has never caused a problem.                        </div>

                            Stay away from Dot5Hosting.  They suck completely.<br/><br/>Currently, I'm with IXWebhosting, and they rock.  Dreamhost is also very good.<br/><br/>I have (currently) about 20 gigs of storage and 300 gigs of transfer for about $90 a year or so, plus they give you credits for registering domain names for free.  <br/><br/>Make sure that whoever you chose, that they support a wide variety of technologies so that whatever you decide to do with the site, you can implement it with ease.  PHP5 is a must, of course.  Your databse of choice is likely to be mySQL, so make sure that they support that - and that they allow for multiple databases.  If you have a blog, a CMS and some other stuff running on a website, each one will likely be database driven.  IXWebhosting gives you 50 databases standard with their business package.<br/><br/>Tech support is always a factor - my host is really good about answering problems quickly and keeping in touch.<br/><br/>Make sure that they support CGI and various scripting languages as well, so that you can implement work-betweens for anything that might need ... working ... between.<br/><br/>But yes - with PHP and mySQL, you can do just about anything on the web.  You really should host on an Apache server - Apache + PHP is much more reliable than Windows + ASP.  Having worked extensively with one for work and one for my own stuff - you don't want to be saddled with ASP.                        </div>

                            There are tons of hosting options around, and everyone has a favorite (and probably a least favorite).  Currently I'm hosting a number of sites (including the Bully Pulpit Games site) on <a href="http://bmhost.com/" rel="nofollow">BMhost</a>.   You can get a baseline hosting plan (50MB storage, 4 GB bandwidth, MySQL database) for $30/year, and can upgrade pretty easily.  They provide fairly intuitive administrative control panels (cPanel, phpmyadmin) and a variety of open-source software packages ready to install.  Most importantly, though their site seems a little obtuse, their support response is great.<br/><br/>I'll throw my weight behind suggestions that you use PHP and MySQL, particularly if you plan to wade into web development by making an online game.                        </div>

                            Pay attention to the download numbers, too (usually measured in MB or GB). All of the other stuff doesn't matter if they shut down your site after 10 people download your 1 MB PDF.                        </div>

I am a web developer and my advise is to consider other options before you try to create your own site. When you say things like, "I think I can do all that with PHP and MySql," I get concern that you may not know all the work involved in maintaining a web site.<br/>
<br/>
Start with how you picture yourself and your players using the site. If you're the one creating most of the content and everyone else adding an occasional comment, a blog host may be better. If you picture anyone starting a discussion, a forum host would be better. If you picture everyone add content wherever it fits, consider a wiki host.<br/>
<br/>
As for on-line dice rolling, there are a number of site that provide this. Use you favourite search engine and look for "secure dice roller".<br/>
<br/>
A database may not be what you need. If you can divide your data into records, and divide the records into small fields, a database would work best. If your data are descriptive texts, one of the above formats may be better.<br/>

                            Thanks, Shaun, I appreciate that.<br/>
<br/>
On a practical level, I want a website so that I can post PDFs for people to download.<br/>
<br/>
On a childish level, I want a new toy. I was a computer programmer  for a long while and I'm getting the urge to play around with stuff again. (It's either a website or a remote-controlled Dalek, frankly).<br/>
<br/>
So, although you're right - I don't know much about maintaining a website - I'm looking forward to learning. And that's also why I'm talking about PHP and databases: I want to make sure that I can use those things if I learn how to. (And, more practically, when I say about doing things with PHP and MySql, I've got the technical ability to learn to use them).<br/>
<br/>
Everyone else: thanks. That was a lot of recommendations for Dreamhost so, after checking them out, I went with them. $7.95 a month is their cheapest option, and it's 20GB of storage and 1Tb transfer, which is way more than what I need. Perfect. Thank you all very much.<br/>
