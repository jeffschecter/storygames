This got me thinking about writing a post with some step-by-step procedures for making new Archipelago playsets. <br/><br/>However\u2026<br/><br/>I don't really think that's what anyone wants. I want people to have fun with it, turn it on its head, create horrible little mutations of it, steal from it, and dissect it out of curiosity. I love seeing the interesting heretical ideas of others.<br/><br/>That being said, there are some fun things to consider if you want to hack the game:<br/><br/><b>The fate cards.</b> Want to make them more specific, and fit your setting? Maybe half of them are about the Queen of Communia, or the daily mood swings of the Volcano? Or maybe they're more like in Itras By - surrealist techniques that make every scene unique and different.<br/><br/><b>The resolution cards.</b> Right now they mostly help you succeed in interesting ways. Maybe you want something more depressing and paranoid, and go with a lot of "no, and"? Or maybe you want to make them escalate - "yes, but draw another card for follow-up"?<br/><br/><b>Ownership of elements.</b> Elements can be setting stuff, of course. But like in "Love in the Time of Seid", they can also be character elements. Can two players own the same element? Can some elements be owned on a turn-by-turn base? Can there be some strategic play around element ownership - maybe you can conquer/steal/earn/buy someone else's? Maybe elements require some pre-game setup from the owners?<br/><br/><b>Phrases.</b> There's a LOT of unexplored territory here. How about phrases like "Say what you really mean", "What would your mother say to that", "Die now", "Meanwhile on the other side of town", "Roll for it", "They love you now", "Power corrupts".<br/><br/><b>The map.</b> In Anarktica, you add elements during play. Can the whole map be done this way, as a way of exploration? Or the opposite - is the universe dying, and you remove star by star from the map every turn, playing the last scene on the last planet in the universe? Can you color it along the way - maybe giving each place a new trait when you color it in? How about using an existing map, and starting the game by mutating it?<br/><br/>That was just a quick morning ramble. If you want to do something with Archipelago, the formal process goes like this:<br/><br/>- Do whatever you want<br/>- Ask me: "Matthijs, I've done , is that okay with you?"<br/>- I answer "Yes!" (historically, this has always been the case, and I can't imagine it not being the case in the future)<br/>- You continue doing what you want                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383940">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EpistolaryRichard" title="EpistolaryRichard"><img alt="EpistolaryRichard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EpistolaryRichard">EpistolaryRichard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383940/#Comment_383940" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-29T19:18:43+00:00" title="June 29, 2012  7:18PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think one of the central points of consideration for me is in the resolution cards. I find these a useful - and highly portable - mechanic appropriate for any games where where players may be dice-averse (for one reason or another). <br/><br/>What are your thoughts about adjusting the odds? The <i>Archipelago </i>deck is slanted towards success. Realising this whilst playing Seid it made me more determined - where an inevitable conflict was brewing - to bring it to a head when I was the narrator and to ensure that the character making the action (and thus improving my character's chances of success).<br/><br/>Did you experiment with different weightings?

There really isn't very much at all to hack, actually, as what I'm thinking of really pretty much follows A2. So far, the only changes that I'd see as necessary are these:<br/>1) Ownership/stewardship of the physical space.<br/><br/>Just like folks can "own" certain elements of the fiction/color and be the go-to person for disagreemnts over their use, someone should be entrusted with ownership of the physical space where scenes take place on a table layout. It's a way for someone to act as a voice of authority when people want to bring in character minis or whatnot that are on the table physically, and a player or two has a disagreement with that.<br/><br/>2) New Ritual Phrases<br/>a) Use the minis, please/Show me with the minis, please<br/>b) Act that out, please<br/><br/>These two are paired. The first one is a reminder that part of the joy of using minis is using the minis and drawing inspiration from them. It's a gentle redirection when folks are going too far afield from their use.<br/><br/>The second one is a gentle reminder to not get too into always talking about things in a removed or third-person way, even though miniatures are being used. It's a tip to go into character and speak as them with another player, especially in mostly dialogue type play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_384676">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384676/#Comment_384676" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-10T06:31:03+00:00" title="July 10, 2012  6:31AM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the idea of one person having ownership over the physical space.

I was using a big table layout, and trying to get folks to set scenes in different areas, the way you'd set scenes on different islands or map areas in basic Archipelago. Basically, the table was acting like the map.<br/><br/>The problem ended up being that the natural inclination of players ( a couple more than others) was to try to bring their character miniatures into the scene action from way across the table, and a couple of times, that kind of thing started to stomp on what a framing player was trying to get at. It would be a bit like a player who was playing characters who were supposed to be on an island way down in the southeast corner of an Archipelago map trying to horn in on the action taking place in a scene set on an island way up in the Northwest corner of a map.<br/><br/>So my thinking is that it would help to have someone own the duty of protecting a scene's integrity in terms of physical focus area, so that a player who is setting up a scene can at least kinda keep it focussed somewhat ontheir initial intent without worrying about pprotecting the "forcefield" around the area where things are being played out.<br/><br/>It was a bigger deal in what I was trying to do, because distance was a bit abstract. We weren't bothering with attempting to do things on a consistent scale. It became problematic when one player tried to set up a scene meant to be a tense but talky scene in the local cantina, and early  another enthusiastic player tried to intervene into it with figures he owned that were across the board in an area meant to be badlands outside of town. A big expectation clash developed. People played through successfully, but I could tell that the scene initiating player really felt a bit like their contribution of setting the scene got a bit trampled, and I agree.<br/><br/>Anyway, the owner of the minis use elemet would be there to aid with those kinds of things. Perhaps ownership of that duty could be permanent, or perhaps it could shift around during play, a sort of floating extra duty meant to facilitate overall play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
