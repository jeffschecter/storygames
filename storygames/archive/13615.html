So there's a certain...um...American unrefined underworld kinda thing going on? You could probably play <i>L.A. Confidential</i> with <i>Dirty Secrets</i> but not <i>A Taste for Murder</i>.<br/><br/><i>A Taste for Murder</i> recreates British murder novels. So there's definitely a certain British politeness to it. You know, the kind of frozen smile that masks disgust. (Also, it includes random weather tables, which really add to the atmosphere of the game. Totally serious!) I'm not as proficient with my British murder novels, so I can't point to a good example. However, I'll say that Hercule Poirot would fit quite well into <i>A Taste for Murder</i>, but not really into <i>Dirty Secrets</i>.<br/><br/>However, both can prominently feature incest, forbidden love, buried family secrets, and, of course, murder most foul. So there's that.<br/><br/>Finally, unless it's unclear, I rather enjoy <i>A Taste For Murder</i>. I can easily see both games in a single collection and getting play at different times. For me, at least, they scratch different itches.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307706/#Comment_307706" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-10T15:23:12+00:00" title="January 10, 2011  3:23PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Seth!<br/><br/>Although I'm hoping to hear more about gameplay as well as Color.<br/><br/>Both games are Players-Portray-Small-Cast of potential murderers and victims and no-one-knows-who-did-it until the end, right?<br/><br/>Is Dirty Secrets a whodunnit, would you say?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307709">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307709/#Comment_307709" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-10T15:46:28+00:00" title="January 10, 2011  3:46PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 10, 2011 3:51PM by Jesse.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul,<br/><br/>Dirty Secrets is very much about the Investigator as moral protagonist.  Every scene features the Investigator, what he learns and what he chooses to do about it.  That's not true in A Taste For Murder.  Inspector Chapel is barely present.  If anything he's more an antagonist that forces the other family members to turn on each other.  Dirty Secrets is a single protagonist narrative.  A Taste For Murder is an ensemble character drama.<br/><br/>In Dirty Secrets the Investigator is played by just one player and everyone else shares a rather large cast of characters.  I might play Jane in one scene and you might play her in another.  That's not true in A Taste For Murder.  Everyone has a fixed character they play.  Whoever dies after Act I takes over the role of Inspector Chapel.  So it's always just one character per player.<br/><br/>It might also help to highlight the method of how you determine the guilty parties.  <br/><br/>Dirty Secrets has multiple Crimes determined by what story length your playing.  A Short Story has two, a Novella has three and a Novel has four.  These can be either Blackmail, Theft or Murder.  There must always be at least one murder.  The first one is determined randomly at the start of the game but the rest are brought into play when someone simply chooses to bring them in.  There is a grid in play (3x3 for a Short Story, 3x6 for a Novella and 6x6 for a Novel.  At the end of each scene someone gets to write a characters name down on the grid.  There is also a little marker that moves around the grid.  How it moves is determined by how long the conflict in the scene was.  Eventually the marker gets boxed in and can't move.  When that happens you roll and the marker jumps to a random square.  If there's no name there, you write one in like usually.  If there IS a name there then that person is guilty of one of the crimes.  If there's a choice remaining you do get to choose which crime you pair the person to.  This does not necessarily correspond to the Investigator figuring it out.  Basically you can work that in at any appropriate moment you like from that point forward.<br/><br/>In A Taste For Murder things are much simpler and the group has a lot more control over things.  First of all there is always ONE and only ONE murder.  It happens at the end of Act I (2 rounds of play) rather than right at the beginning.  During Act II what happens is players can investigate each other (not just Inspector Chapel).  Investigating is not about clue hunting but rather about forcing a character to confess or reveal something dark and sinister about their relationship with the victim.  This is a three step process which progressively makes each character's relationship with the victim darker and darker.  Once TWO players have all three steps in that progression filled out there is a kind of roll-off mechanic that determines which one is actually the guilty party.<br/><br/>Hope that helps.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307710/#Comment_307710" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-10T15:54:15+00:00" title="January 10, 2011  3:54PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesse,<br/><br/>That's an awesome answer, thank you!<br/><br/>It sounds like A Taste for Murder might be a better game for a mixed-ages non-gamer group, whereas Dirty Secrets is more intense emotionally.

Dirty Secrets has a lot of random elements that can produce "uncomfortable" results and everything in A Taste For Murder is generally made up directly to the group's taste.<br/><br/>A Taste For Murder is a lot lighter game mechanically speaking.  So yes, I think non-gamers would take to it better.  There's a lot of "gamy-ness" to Dirty Secrets.  For example the central resolution mechanics Liars Dice played in full with all the bluffing tactics of that game fully in place.  There's also some strategy to controlling the board if you want to influence either the pacing or the likelihood of someone being guilty.  <br/><br/>Resolution in a Taste For Murder is a simple roll-off mechanics with less options (and less incentive) to "win".  There's some decisions you might make if you are trying to avoid being guilty or really want to push for someone in specific to be the kill.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307718/#Comment_307718" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-10T16:52:09+00:00" title="January 10, 2011  4:52PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>It sounds like A Taste for Murder might be a better game for a mixed-ages non-gamer group, whereas Dirty Secrets is more intense emotionally.

Because the Investigator comes into a situation that they (must) have a certain distance from (in order to comment/screw with people), and nobody else has a permanent character, the players maintain a gleeful distance from the terrible maneuverings and lies of their characters.
