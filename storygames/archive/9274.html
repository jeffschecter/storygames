Basically, sections of movies screened with the performer voicing replacement dialogue (as in woody allen's <i>what's up tiger lilly</i>), or commentary in place of the dialogue, a new soundtrack, etc. <br/><br/>That plus a game I've been playing that draws loosely on a genre got me thinking.  Instead of playing a game inspired by genre X or source Y- take an original film, book, whatever and the game is to comment on/ alter/ shorten/  re-voice that original instead in a way that pays homage to or makes fun of it or a combo. <br/><br/>Not exactly sure how- if there should be a set of tools etc but it seems worth trying. Anyone ever done something like this?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_205313">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205313/#Comment_205313" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-05T06:38:08+00:00" title="May  5, 2009  6:38AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh, a benshi interpretation on roleplaying games sounds like it would be a fifth player, someone who doesn't have a character or anything, who simply watches what happens and makes commentary.Also gives background to the characters, and interprets events for an invisible audience.<br/><br/>Add "off-color commentary", and I can recall two instances where a role-playing game I played contained a benshi, disguised as an obnoxious fool hovering over the table (despite not playing) and offering his Monty Python commentary and fart jokes.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_205694">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/markv" title="markv"><img alt="markv" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/markv">markv</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205694/#Comment_205694" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-06T12:09:16+00:00" title="May  6, 2009 12:09PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            andy, I like the idea of a commentator player, perhaps rotating, that could provide perspective while other players are focusing on their characters<br/><br/>some additional examples of this kind of thing<br/><br/>1. play an old school D&amp;D module using a system that itself is a kind of commentary/ homage/ parody &gt; like hackmaster or drowning &amp; falling<br/>2. play an old school module using an indie rpg like, I don't know, my life with master for Queen of the demon web pits or Village of hommlet with dogs in the vineyard<br/>3. 'play' a film or youtube video with each player assigned a main character and bit characters and getting a set number of rewinds/ pauses to think of dialogue to insert in lieu of the film dialogue<br/>4. play a randomly chosen pulp story with players able to re-arrange or rip out pages, role-play scenes, assign dice or cards to important characters, plot points, villains etc                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
