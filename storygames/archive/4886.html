The basic bones of the game are sound, particularly the tarot-like deck that drives events in play, but there are game-mechanical and game text-related issues that I want to address before I'll feel okay about putting it out there again.<br/><br/>The game-mechanical issues relate mainly to the economy of gifts and burdens that are the main character resource in the game. I think I've got a handle on that, but I need to do some more playtesting to make sure. I've also discovered that I need to make a decision about whether the game (a) needs explicit stake-setting, (b) doesn't need explicit stake-setting, or (c) can be played either way so long as everybody at the table agrees that that's how to do it. I don't think the answer is (c), by the way, but I'm not sure.<br/><br/>The textual issues have to do with both form and content. Nathan Paoletta has convinced me that the current layout of the book is both ugly and ineffective from a readability standpoint. Also, the rules explanations don't really do the game justice: I want to re-write the rules in a way that bottles the awesome that happens at the table. And I think I owe it to the topic to make more explicit reference to Inuit culture and mythology as the source material for the game.<br/><br/>Additionally, I'm looking into ways of producing the Ganakagok tarot in more than hand-crafted quantities (i.e., a dozen or so decks at a time, copied onto card stock and cut by hand), but I foresee difficulties.<br/><br/>I'm going to playtest changes in the game through the summer, probably, and then finish updating the rules and have a completed text by the end of the summer. Laying out the revised text and putting it into print will hopefully be done by the end of next year, if I keep up my end.<br/><br/>So that's where things stand. I appreciate you asking about it. I love Ganakagok, and when it's firing on all cylinders it produces a play experience that's literally fabulous. The people who play it really dig it when it works and see its potential even when it doesn't.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
