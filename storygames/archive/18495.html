You see it in videogames, and movies, and comicbooks, and everywhere. I think it's fair to say that these beams of force, and balls of fire, and bolts of lightning, and cosmic rays are, arguably, metaphors for a character's destructive POWER over his or her environment. <br/><br/>Supernatural/superhuman power is an old old old idea of course. But, I was thinking that this "energy blast" in the way we commonly see it in the media today might be kind of modern -- maybe even uncommon until the 20th century? The idea of harnessing and controlling <b>raw energy</b> and zapping it at stuff, I mean. It might be a newish concept. <br/><br/>"Power" when you had it in the past, used to always be about muscle power or will power or charisma: even Zeus had to throw the lightning at his enemies -- it didn't just come out of his fingers; even dragons "breathed" fire -- they don't just make it appear. <br/><br/>Superman and Gandalf are rough contemporaries I guess, but Lord of the Rings is clearly based on an older tradition. Compare Lord of the Rings magic to energy beam zaps: on middle earth, it's all about personal will and an ineffable "greatness" of spirit and the seen and unseen nature of things and an augmentation of things that already exist. RARELY is there a blast of raw glowing boom light. The "magic" is very quiet and otherworldly. I mean, think about the RING -- the most powerful magic gew gaw in the world -- what's it even do? It's not an atom bomb. If Sauron gets it, he is going to use it to influence peoples feelings! He's going to corrupt people's intentions! It will allow him to build bigger armies and trick his foes. That's it. And, somehow that's much scarier than just blowing everyone up. It's more insidious. And, as a result, for me anyway, the magic in Tolkien carries more mystery and drama than the standard zap battle you see today.<br/> <br/>Now, obviously, a) zap battles are awesome, and b) there are a zillion really good powers in comicbooks or fantasy or whatever that are plenty interesting -- it isn't all just pyrotechnics today. But, when I see it, I really appreciate thoughtful executions of the idea of power. I love the magic in Lady Blackbird for example. <br/><br/>Something I haven't seen much of though and would love to see more is the 21st century destructive power metaphor that says something more than ZORCH you're dead! So, in addition to inviting any and all thoughts on the subject, my question is: what would be a good example of supernatural/magical/sci-fi  that is a) a metaphor for a human's destructive power over his environment and b) related to a 21st century understanding of "power." <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416310/#Comment_416310" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-14T14:53:55+00:00" title="June 14, 2013  2:53PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Less about destructive power and more about powers of adaptation, but Jack Hawksmoor, the "King of Cities" from Warren Ellis' THE AUTHORITY immediately jumped to mind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416311">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard" title="AMBayard"><img alt="AMBayard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard">AMBayard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416311/#Comment_416311" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-14T15:03:01+00:00" title="June 14, 2013  3:03PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's an awesome example that I was not familiar with.

He was really psyched to be on the Backup Justice League Reserve (second string).<br/><br/>This is actually not too bad as far as roleplaying goes because of course eventually a giant ape attacks the city or aliens invade or the dead rise and it's all hands on deck.<br/><br/>So being the "new kid" is a pretty cool thing to be in that situation. It also helps spotlight the established characters in ways that they won't spotlight each other.  Supergirl is not going to say "Oh my god, what's THAT?", she's punched giant apes 100 times before.  But if someone yells "Oh my god, Supergirl, what's THAT?!" she can be cool.<br/><br/>Anyway my guy was working on some part of some alien invasion problem and Supergirl was there, and we had a plan. But we needed someone with a ranged energy power to do something or other. My guy yells "Supergirl, you could use your laser eyes!" And she says, "I think that might work. They're not laser eyes."<br/><br/>Later we're talking about our plan with someone else and my guy says "...okay then at this point, Supergirl will use her laser eyes." She says "They're not laser eyes." <br/><br/>Later we're fighting the aliens and the moment comes and my guy yells into his Justice League communicator: "Blue Girl! This is the <a href="http://youtu.be/5P8frmCmkTE" rel="nofollow">Dance Commander</a>! It's time! Hammer down! Use your laser eyes, come back, over and out!" (he treated his Justice League communicator like it was a CB radio and also it was 1979).<br/><br/>She screams "JET I DO NOT HAVE LASER EYES!! I DO NOT HAVE LASER EYES!!!! MY EYES ARE NOT LASERS!! IT'S HEAT VISION JET!! HEAT VISIONNNNN!!!" It was literally the first recorded moment in the game's history when Supergirl lost her temper.<br/><br/>And yes, the player was savvy enough that later she described the scene to Superman, concluding: "And that's when I used my laser eyes."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416348">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonT" title="JasonT"><img alt="JasonT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonT">JasonT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416348/#Comment_416348" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-15T08:43:24+00:00" title="June 15, 2013  8:43AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I forget where I read this analysis (some book on manga back in college?), but I think it might be relevant to mention the metaphor behind giant, anthropomorphized robots in 20th century Japanese pop culture. Robots became especially popular after WWII, when the idea behind human control over technology had obvious resonance. Making sci-far war machines human-shaped arguably represented a reining-in of power and taking-control of technology for the common good, rather than the effortless destructive force of weaponized nuclear energy.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
