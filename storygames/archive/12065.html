Ask questions that aim at relationships. "How long have you known her?" "How does it feel when he's around?" "Which one of them do you hate the most?"<br/><br/>2. Ask questions that aim at scarcity. "Where do you guys get your water?" "How long before the wild rabbits die out and you have to find a new source of food?" "Who has control over gasoline in your hold?"<br/><br/>3. Ask questions that relate to their special stuff. "What does it feel like when you open your brain?" "What do you tell your followers about the gods?" "Has your gang been happy lately?"                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270220">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270220/#Comment_270220" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-06T08:16:19+00:00" title="May  6, 2010  8:16AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If a character has a group of dudes (gang, crew, followers, whatever), I like to ask "Okay, who stands out the most?

If you've been doing your apocalyptic dreaming then a lot of the questions will just follow from that, but you've got to know how it all fits together.  Christian asked us who we've been sleeping with, if anyone, or who we had our eye on.<br/><br/>Start with a "how can I fuck with the characters" frame and a few other questions should pop to mind, things that get at what the characters care about and have to fight to get/keep.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270250">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270250/#Comment_270250" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-06T10:44:38+00:00" title="May  6, 2010 10:44AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that's where "look for where they're not in control" comes in. <br/><br/>Who do they care about?

Leading questions, man.  Players will fall for them every time.<br/><br/>"You're not just going to let Zed get away with what he did, are you?"  ("Hell no!")  "Right.  What was it he did again?"<br/>"Does Ambergrease hate you even more than he hates the rest of them?"  ("Oh shit yeah he does.")  "Thought so.  Was it because you stole from him, or was it that you made him look weak?"<br/>"Whitechurch thinks you're going to stab him in the back.  Is he right?" ("Hmm.  Yeah!")  [Alternatively] ("Nope.") "Cool.  Who ARE you going to betray, then?"<br/>"Who's the one person in this room you would save?  If--just hypothetically--a grenade were to pop in the window in the next minute or so."<br/><br/>The nice thing about this approach is that it allows you to sneak in some really hard framing (or Future Badness) without it feeling like fiat and making the players feel like they're being backed up to the wall.  Players love to find sneaky ways out of situations where they're being pressured into doing something, but if you lead them along with questions, there's this little mental switch that goes "of course I want to do this!  I answered yes!"  Then you can aim them at anything you want like the engines of destruction that they are.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270285">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270285/#Comment_270285" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-06T14:40:56+00:00" title="May  6, 2010  2:40PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The main points have been covered pretty well but I like asking the players "Who makes life the hardest for your character?

Ask follow-ups to their HX questions. Like, "Oh, man, you stood up to him, gang and all? What did you stand up to him about?" or "So he left you bleeding, huh? Okay, who got you bleeding in the first place? And you, why'd you leave him instead of helping him?"<br/><br/>Some playbooks are better in this regard than others.<br/><br/>Edit to add: And if you've got an Operator, question that obligation gig like crazy, man. Seeking Answers? Revenge? Paying Debts? That's money, right there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270328">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Michael%20Pfaff" title="Michael Pfaff"><img alt="Michael Pfaff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Michael%20Pfaff">Michael Pfaff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270328/#Comment_270328" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-07T05:42:54+00:00" title="May  7, 2010  5:42AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is great stuff guys.
