I've got a system and narrative structure that models the road trip aspect pretty well, with all the antics and hijinks that ensue from those adventures. The one thing I've been having a heck of a time developing is a model for coming of age and growing up, as in stories like Stand By Me and Avatar: the Last Airbender. <br/><br/>For the past several drafts, I've been using Bonds to track coming of age. Bonds are sort of like Keys in TSOY or Aspects in FATE. They incentivize certain actions in the story. However, a Bond represents your feelings towards a companion rather than your own traits or skills. Certain actions would strengthen those relationships. Other actions would change those bonds into another kind of relationship.<br/><br/>If you strengthen a Bond on your turn, you can reserve brownie points that can be spent later in later turns to make you more effective. However, you can't tap into those brownie points unless you <i>change</i> one of your relationships. <br/><br/>For example, you have a Bond of the Crush to your companion. Bonds of the Crush are strengthened by performing acts of courage and generosity for your companion. You do this a couple times and have saved up a few brownie points. Then you decide to tap into those points for a crucial scene at the end of the session, so you change the Bond of the Crush to Bond of Rivalry. Thereafter, if you want to reserve some brownie points, you have to perform acts that strengthen this sense of rivalry with your companion.<br/><br/>You can only change a Bond twice. Whatever feelings you have towards your companion in that third Bond will stick until adulthood.<br/><br/>So basically, I'm tracking relationships changing over time as a measure of "growing up." I like this conceit, but I'm not sure if the execution is as good as it could be. Some key things to note before I get to my point:<br/><br/>* I'd like this cycle of Cultivating and Changing Bonds to happen at a slower pace than buying off Keys. I think the "two changes" limit does this pretty well. Note that you can have Bonds to any companion and even to NPCs, so it's unlikely that you'll have a total lack of options in later sessions, even if you've hit that cap with several characters.<br/><br/>* Also, the brownie points you reserve are not tied to any one Bond, so you could gather a bunch of brownie points by strengthening any Bond, even one that's reached its cap, because you can still use those points by changing another Bond entirely.<br/><br/>* It would be nice if there were some more player cross-referencing when it came to each other's Bonds, like people referencing each other's thematic batteries in FLFS, but that might be lasersharking in this case.<br/><br/>* You get your first Bonds in character creation, but they're actually chosen by the players of those characters. They decide how your character feels about theirs, and vice versa. This is a recent change in the last playtest and it worked out well, but was awkward to phrase at the table. :P<br/><br/>Okay, to my point: I'm looking for any other examples of using relationships as stats in this way, to track their growth and change over time as a metaphor for coming-of-age. After so many drafts and playtests, I feel like I'm stumbling in the dark and I need some other points of reference just to get a sense of my own direction.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204063">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204063/#Comment_204063" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-29T04:52:55+00:00" title="April 29, 2009  4:52AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My concerns:<br/><br/>- All relationships keep changing, period; so the capping thing strikes me as an imperfect, less interesting solution.  If the back-and-forth in the relationship between two characters is really interesting and fun, removing it from the game seems less good.<br/><br/>- Especially if the players are free to change their relationships whenever you want (which sounds like what you want), finding a way to pace them out, so they're slow, is going to be hard.  If you put an incentive on something (you get points for it!), players are going to want to do it; so trying to get them not to do it is working against their instincts.<br/><br/>Bliss Stage does something semi-related, though it's a much darker, more serious game most of the time, with using relationships as stats.  Each relationship is measured in Intimacy, Trust, and Stress, which are interrelated, with Trust going down every time you have more Stress than Trust.  Downtime scenes then act as refreshes (similar to Agon, in some ways), which can relieve your Stress, or as "experience" scenes in which you improve the Intimacy or Trust of that particular relationship.  Note, however, that Bliss Stage doesn't have descriptors that mark the nature of the relationship; that's all left up to the players, but you certainly could have tags on the relationship that were changed through certain scenes, if you like the downtime-scenes idea. Avatar definitely has downtime scenes in which the kids talk about their relationships (or fight, or wander off in a huff by themselves, or do other things that are really about expressing their relationships).  All the time.  So that might work.  Interestingly, in Bliss Stage, the other players judge the downtime scene and decide what kind of refresh or experience scene it ultimately was, which is cool because sometimes scenes develop in ways that the players involved in the scene don't expect.  This also happens in Avatar (unexpected developments) so I think that should be incorperated in some way, if possible, even if not in the "other players judge" sense.<br/><br/>There's also the Aspects/Dogs traits way of handling relationships, where -- whatever your current relationship is described as -- that limits how you can draw on it to get bonuses.  Like, if my Dogs trait is "I Hate My Father," then I can't draw on it unless I can find some way to bring in my anger and resentment.  And then you could add on some system for changing what the relationship traits mean (fallout, advancement, buyoffs, etc.).  That turns relationships into direct advantages, rather than earning you points like Keys, which are later spent as advantages.  This effectively lets you evoke relationships during conflicts and say, "Okay, my fight against the evil governor is partially about my bad relationship with my dad," which may make explicit the implicit stuff that's happening within your character (some folks like that, some people like the subtext to stay more below the surface).<br/><br/>There's also another method, which I've been messing with, where you upgrade or change relationship descriptors based on what actually happens during play, on a scene to scene basis.  So, basically, players decide when a Key/Aspect/Trait has changed, whether for their own character or for someone else's character.  This is interesting because there are multiple ways in which a relationship could change: in potency (move from d6 to d8 say), in character ("I have a crush on you" to "I resent you"), in reliability or strength (like Trust in Bliss Stage or earning tokens that can be spent), etc.  There's also different ways to decide how a trait has changed and what the changes look like.  Maybe the group decides together, maybe a player has total control over their character's relationships, maybe relationships are mutual things that the two players involved both have authority over, maybe relationships are both mutual and independent i some fashion, etc. In fact, all of these kinds of small decisions could be made with Keys/Aspects/Whatever Other kind of relationship mechanic you end up with too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DevP" title="DevP"><img alt="DevP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/818/nB2L0MAZS1OU2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DevP">DevP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204074/#Comment_204074" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-29T05:31:17+00:00" title="April 29, 2009  5:31AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If relationships don't cap the number of possible changes, how does a guidelines like this sound?

It does reflect how these stories tend to view adulthood (as a more stable point in life that occurs after you figure out who you are). I don't think a hard limit for the number of changes is right.<br/><br/>How about making the bonds harder to change each time? I'm going to suggest some mechanic here that is illustrative, but not necessarily good. The two traditional ways to do this is with a roll and a rising target number, or with a point cost that increases each time. Somehow it needs to be more than that, tied to a sense of investment in whatever the bond currently is (you don't want the mechanic to promote changing the bond, instead you want the story to make it necessary to pay the price of changing it).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204392">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204392/#Comment_204392" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-30T07:30:30+00:00" title="April 30, 2009  7:30AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, thank you all so much for this input. It's definitely revving up my engines again. Jonathan, thank you especially for that very thorough writeup.<br/><br/>Madunkieg addresses something that I wanted to model in this particular flavor of coming-of-age story. The conceit is that adulthood is the end of any interesting part of a character's life. Grown-ups are who they are and they don't really change much. It's the young protagonists of the story that are dynamic, whose destinies are in flux. Obviously this is not <i>really</i> the case, but that's just how these stories go.<br/><br/>Besides an arbitrary cap or rising penalties for each relationship-change, you could just have dwindling benefits. The first change gives you X brownie points, the second gives you half that, the third gives you half of that and any subsequent changes offer not points at all. That's just one idea though. As you said, illustrative, but not necessarily good. :P<br/><br/>I've definitely been considering less hardcoding in the relationship mechanics, but I am concerned that without mechanics or incentives, this aspect of the game may not be addressed in play. Maybe that's my board game background talking though?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204592">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204592/#Comment_204592" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-30T19:49:53+00:00" title="April 30, 2009  7:49PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Daniel,<br/>Check out the "Reputation" slots on the <a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/downloads/index.php?cat=3" rel="nofollow">character sheet</a> from <a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/games/index.php?game=grey_ranks" rel="nofollow">Grey Ranks</a>.
