Their character is either run as an NPC or -- and this I like better -- actually serves as the "unreliable narrator" of the scenario; she/he is presumed to be there, but they take no active part in the goings-on.  If, by some chance, that session ends with the party being killed, the current GM's character is the only survivor.  For the next session, another player takes up the GM's mantle; <i>his</i> character vanishes from the spotlight, and the story continues to unfold -- perhaps off on a new tangent every session as different storytelling styles are explored.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre there any games that already use such a system?  What difficulties should I expect?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nScott                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171971">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buffaloraven" title="buffaloraven"><img alt="buffaloraven" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buffaloraven">buffaloraven</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171971/#Comment_171971" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-29T15:31:07+00:00" title="September 29, 2008  3:31PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've tried this with D+D.

We changed GMs every session, and it worked fine. The overarching plot did get pretty bizarre, but it was intended to be a light-hearted game from the beginning. I'm not sure how well this would work for a more serious story. Part of the fun in that game was in ending your session in such a way as to make continuing the story as challenging as possible, or beginning your turn by twisting the events that went before into a new perspective. <br><br>For a more serious game, you might need to put some ground rules in place about how everyone builds on the previously determined story. Or change GMs after a story, not a session, as already suggested.<br><br>We played that the GM's character took no active part in the story, which worked well enough. <br><br>On a totally unrelated note, thinking about that game reminded me of a silly but rather fun element that got added. Some evil shaman or god cursed us, so that anyone who could see auras could see a word somehow in there. If any one of us said that word, we got transported to an alternate plane of... whatever the word was. I seem to remember that we spent time in the planes of beer, wankel rotary engines, ants, and seeds (amongst others).                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171995">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171995/#Comment_171995" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-29T17:33:12+00:00" title="September 29, 2008  5:33PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another vote for doing this with light hearted Dnd. <br>\n<br>\ndid it , it was fun, but again the wierdness got to it (wierd is good in dnd as its a sort of meta genre i find) <br>\n<br>\n(Interdimensional Inn's, Dragon Lich's , Fire Giant Furnace Men, Amorphous Lion Killers, Eberron and Darksun, good times)                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171997">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171997/#Comment_171997" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-29T18:16:01+00:00" title="September 29, 2008  6:16PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Our group did this for a WWII game, but we structured it so that each session was an independent episode that involved characters selected for a mission in some far-flung part of the globe.  We rotated GMs each session, with each doing one session per game year, often coordinated with events of the war.  So one session might be a raid with the USAF in February 1944 and the next a paratrooper insertion in Normandy in July.  We used a troupe-style cast of characters, and the players for each session would choose PCs to play for the session.  There was some overall continuity and character development, but it was definitely secondary to the overall story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ScottOden" title="ScottOden"><img alt="ScottOden" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ScottOden">ScottOden</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172011/#Comment_172011" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-29T20:41:09+00:00" title="September 29, 2008  8:41PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the replies!<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm glad to hear this isn't as off-the-wall as I'd feared.

We had a box of characters on index cards, and the GM of the moment would give out some general information, and the players would root through the box to find their favorite guy for that sort of mission.  There was very little consistency from mission to mission - some were bizarre, some were comic, some were gritty, some (well, mine) were Lovecraftian.  Characters developed over time and had some shared experiences.  NPCs emerged, both allies and villains.  The most satisfying thing to me was the reincorporation of elements from GM to GM.  We had some memorable villains and NPCs who seemed to transcend personal preference and GMing style to reappear in fun ways.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172060">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172060/#Comment_172060" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-30T07:02:58+00:00" title="September 30, 2008  7:02AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The beauty of our system was that it didn't matter who showed up to play each week, since it was all self-contained from game to game.  Something to watch out for then is when your story runs over into two sessions.

But, this whole set-up of yours sounds excellent for a long-term campaign set during the Crusades.  That way, I could still use the ambiance and scene construction of REH's Crusader tales -- perhaps with some Harold Lamb thrown in.  In fact, we could play the First Crusade as the opening campaign and go from there if excitement warrants (the seiges of Antioch, alone, would likely take several sessions).<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll have to start a new thread asking advice for making mass Medieval battles interesting from a roleplaying point-of-view . . .<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your help!<br/>\n<br/>\nScott                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172260">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MountZionRyan" title="MountZionRyan"><img alt="MountZionRyan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/426/nG1TIXTID71FS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MountZionRyan">MountZionRyan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172260/#Comment_172260" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-01T06:29:49+00:00" title="October  1, 2008  6:29AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This sounds like a great set-up for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Company" rel="nofollow">Black Company</a> type  game.

Whoever had their character sent off (or volunteered to take the mission) becomes the GM for the game. To end the session, the GM just narrates her character returning to join the group.
