Its self-propagating magnetic patterns stirred the molten metals into shape, casting each element carefully in place, hull and wiring, reactor and drive. When the end came, the <i>Biot-Savart</i> was violently rocketed from the core of the planet, its still-molten form cooling and hardening into a trillion-ton radioactive warship. Its AI crew has a half-life of over a billion years, programmed to protect the humans who wonder if it might have been the true cause of the planet's destruction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_340647">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340647/#Comment_340647" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-26T13:34:39+00:00" title="August 26, 2011  1:34PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm the engineer Ignacio del Valle, sole survivor aboard the Soylent Green, a factory ship specialized in recycling organic material and processing it into diverse edible protein packs, ranging from the premium quality canned beef Arsogus  to the popular Nielsen Cookies.

He lies comatose at my heart, my primary directive to keep him alive until his recovery or he voluntarily surrenders me to another worthy owner. His final conscious instruction to me was to keep the fleet safe and help it find a new home.<br/><br/>Dak-Lor is a non matter vessel, and as such cannot be detected by standard sensors, and requires no fuel, supplies, or ammunition. It is effectively indestructible and capable of both atmospheric and interstellar travel. <br/><br/>Dak-Lor's small size and speed makes it useful for reconnaissance, and the blades you see extending from it are exceedingly effective in close-range combat against standard star fighter designs, but it has no ballistic weapons of any kind. <br/><br/>Once at Dawn each Fleet Day, a native of the planet whose heart is without malice and whose spirit craves justice must come aboard and lay his hand upon me and speak the Oath, or the Dak-Lor will rapidly begin to degrade, compromising both my owner's life support and the cloak that hides him (and by extension the fleet) from the Jaundiced Ones.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340748">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bryan" title="Bryan"><img alt="Bryan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bryan">Bryan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340748/#Comment_340748" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-28T06:49:42+00:00" title="August 28, 2011  6:49AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 28, 2011 7:04AM by Bryan.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We live aboard the computer-controlled, dark-ship Lev Nikolayevich Tolstoy. After a month, we started calling it the Toast, although the computer didn't like the nick name, it eventually went along with it. Yesterday, Jenny and I made the five-hour trek to Forward Observation One to watch Eris pass. We were the first to lay human eyes on the lumpy and gray dwarf planet. From many decks below the rest of the student saw it slightly later.<br/><br/>The day good-old Toast launched, we stared out of the cabin windows watching other dark-ship flee from the incoming missile ships. I think I saw mother and father waving goodbye from behind the fences and barriers. The flags were flying -- from all the nations of Earth. Jenny likes to think she saw Mom smile. A day after we launched, we were passed by 1-km-radius, sphere-shaped, colony ship Hero heading to life under the icy surface of Europa. Two weeks later, we watched the launch of the perimeter watch dogs -- large discs of weapons that will form a sphere around the solar system within two years. We hear that tomorrow the first of the missile ships will strike home and destroy it. Over 10,000 will follow after that. <br/><br/>Day to day life on Toast has been slow. The computer teaches us ethics, math, science and we're learning about every system on the ship in case the computer goes cold. One day, one of us will make the decision to destroy our enemy. We or one of the other 5,000 dark ships will find them and we will destroy them before they see us coming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_340757">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jumanji83" title="Jumanji83"><img alt="Jumanji83" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jumanji83">Jumanji83</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340757/#Comment_340757" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-28T09:33:39+00:00" title="August 28, 2011  9:33AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Name's Jesse Sinclair, pardner!
