They where send there to check on the dwarfs (also followers of Katar) because no one had heard from then in a year. <br/><br/>They entered the first room that was made up of a perfect dome, hammered from the stone and found a big pile of bones in the middle of it. Maus went and searched for traps and found a magical force field that was sure to activate some kind of trap. After throwing a stone against it to safely activate it the whole dome started to shrink magically, threatening to crush our lovely bands of adventures to rubble. Maus and Gregor made a quick run to the exit but Rurgosh wasn't fast enough. Alone in the room he casts guidance and a ghostly Ibis flys to a specific point in the globe. The dwarf makes a rush for it and passes through an ilusoary field directly into the next room. A huge cave filed with glowing stones (no one asked but the glow really wasn't natural), a small but fast river and lots of shrubery vegetation. They had no time to check the scenery as a pack of 3 hyeans appeared over the next small hill and charged them. A battle ensued in which Gregor was hit by an arrow, coming from *somewhere over there*. Maus saw this and went to sneak up on the archer, a gnoll scout. He was ready to jump and backstab him as another Gnoll, this one really thin and hungry looking wacked him over the head and tried to bite the shit out of him. Meanwhile the battle had thrown Rurgrosh into the River where he lost his Warhammer. Gregor went to charge the Gnoll archer put had to dive behind some cover while he was layed with covering fire. Maus used the moment of unbalance of the Gnoll and kicked him into the river and then jumped the archer, ending him in a quick 2 combo backstab. The hungry gnoll continued to fight the dwarf but a whack of the trusty dwarfen hammer ended him too but he fell on Rurgosh nearly chocking him as he fought for air. <br/><br/>A moment earlier while searching for his hammer Rurgosh saw a third gnoll scout, heading into a tunnel but did nothing about it. <br/><br/>The group made camp then. On Gregors (totally failed) watch a huge group of far realm monsters looking a bit like Will O Wisps entered 2 of the 3 tunnels that lead out of the big cave. The dwarf realised with a shock that these creatures are sworn enemies of the cult of Kratar since they tricked and killed people with to little knowledge. He decided to take care of them later and the group went into the tunnel that the Gnoll took. Soon in complete darkness the cleric tried to cast light (but failed) and the whole party was suddently emitting bright, slightly pink, light. Maus knew that this surely had to mean that they where chosen of Katar and had to go on a quest to please him before he would rid them of his "gift". As he is a sneaky kind of guy he really wasn't happy with being a walking torch ( i am really not sure if this went against "being a fan of the PCs" but it seemed so cool to me in this moment). <br/><br/>After a while they found themselves in a one corridor library with magic books of Katar-Priests (only readable by some). Maus of course went an got some books that looked valuable to him but failed to notice the far realm beasty sneaking up behind him. <br/><br/>A flesh colored blob from which from time to time a humanoid shape with 3 arms emerged was "sneaking" up on him. Throwing bookshelfs arroudn and turning them to colorfull goo with just a touch. The others saw it and came to help there halfling "friend". After Gregor choped on of the 3 arms (that seemed to move and reapaer wherever the creature wanted) with his signature sword the arm kept glued to the blade and continued to harras him. Growing extra palms and nails to hit him. He ran into the next room. <br/>The battlecleric of course took his warhammer and tried to bash this things flobby featureless face in but a touch of fingers turned the ground into a pudding/quicksand like substance and the dwarf had to fight getting eaten by the ground. Meanwhile a giant eye had appeared on the side of the creature and as Maus stabbed it with his trusty rapier he had a vision of himself completly covered in his own blood as if every blood vessel he had had suddently exploded, he found his arm to be covered in tiny scratches afterwards. <br/><br/>In the next room, the main observatory all hell had brooken loose. Gregor was still fighting with the arm on his sword, a rift to far realm had oppened over the telescope and more of the glowing lightpoints where flying around but this time they had tentacles. In the other corner where a group of 3 gnolls arround a big fire. He charged them, hacking there leader nearly to death as the arm seemed to help him. Maybe it was just hungry for flesh, who knows. <br/><br/>In the library Maus tried to get the attention of the thing so that his dwarfen friend could escape and dodged his long, Mr. Fantastic like arms by jumping against a bookshelf where saw a big book with gold envelop and had to get it, even if that meant that he was buried under the falling shelf. This gave Rugosh enough time to get out of the pit and distract the thing himself so that the two of them could run away. <br/><br/>In the observatory Gregor was trying to kill the gnoll shaman now that was chanting arround a ritual circle with the big fire inside. A pair of demon hands rose out of the ground and with to much momentum from the strike the fighter stumbled INTO the circle himself and promptly had to defy danger of demonic possession. He missed. His vision turned red and his companions arrived just in time to see a glowing crown of fire appear over his head. <br/><br/>The demon instatly summoned a firesword to his hand and did lay waste to the gnolls arround him. Then Rugosh stepped in to help his friend. But neither his magic nor his fighting power was enough to help him. The arrows, fired by Mouse also didn't help and even after trying to stop the demon again with sheer force of will or muscle Gregor could not shake this demon off. He grew balrog like wings, destroyed the rest of the ceyling and took of into the night. <br/><br/>We ended the session there. I gave Gregor the chance for the last breath move and he rolled a 7-9. A devil appeared in his mind. Telling him that this possession tipped the cosmic balance and that this was not acceptable in devil hell. He offered him a trade. Possession of a helpfull devil instead of a rampaging balor. He accepted. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394188">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Praion" title="Praion"><img alt="Praion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Praion">Praion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394188/#Comment_394188" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-21T12:07:58+00:00" title="October 21, 2012 12:07PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/><br/>Gregor also had a level up. I was thinking of giving him the chance to take this move to reflect the deal with the devil.<br/><br/>A deal with the devil<br/>From time to time the devil in your head will suggest that you do a certain thing. If you do it, take +1 forward in the pursuit of this thing and mark 1 exp when you accomplish it. <br/><br/>This could easily lead him into a compendium class (The Faust maybe) that offers moves that give you instead success for devilish control later. Something like this<br/><br/>Devil tongue<br/>When you led the devil in your head to the talking for you you can treat your parley roll as a 10+ but the devil get's 1 hold on you. The GM can spend that hold to make you do things without your control. If you want to fight it you have to defy danger with cha. <br/><br/>And other things like it. Maybe getting a firesword or new knowledge... What are your thoughts about it? Has someone allready designed something like that? <br/><br/>I now need to create some fronts. I will post about this tomorrow and hope i can get your help.<br/><br/>I and the players had a lot of fun. I was actually planned as just a one shot before we pick up our Mouse Guard game again but now everyone wants to know what will happen to Gregor.  Lot's of fun was had even though the players kept getting off-topic a lot.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_394314">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Praion" title="Praion"><img alt="Praion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Praion">Praion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394314/#Comment_394314" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-22T11:41:50+00:00" title="October 22, 2012 11:41AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For fronts i am thinking about 4 things right now. <br/><br/>The devil in Gregors head &lt;- big front<br/><br/>(+ they are kind of related - maybe one big front?)<br/><br/>The aftershocks of the unleashed demon that destroyed 2 cities &lt;-- adventure front<br/><br/>The far realm rift that is not taken care off &lt;- also a campaign front (or whatever they are called) <br/><br/><br/>The devil is a planar force but none of them really seems to fit. He is a construct of law but maybe a "god" too. To gather worshippers (people that sell theyre souls) seems to be his thing so i am going with this. NO wait! He is a Arcana Enemy - curse! <br/><br/>Let's say one of the destroyed towns was highly militarised and now is searching for a new place to live. They are a ambitious organisation - Misguided good. <br/><br/>For the other citie that is part of this i am thinking cursed place and unholy ground. Everyone lost all hope and maybe something has gotten free - i don't know. <br/><br/>So <br/><br/>1. Front: Aftermath of a giant demon attack<br/><br/>A Devil, Bilzirn -  an ancient curse <br/><br/>The legion of StokRa, a dwarfen army on the search for a new home - misguided good<br/><br/>Shirn, completly destroyed cities of lost wonder - unholy place/dark portal <br/><br/><br/><br/>2. Front: A rift to the far realms <br/><br/>The rift about the old dwarfen observatory spilling strange UnCreatures into the world - Elemental vortex<br/><br/>The brothers of the eye, the guys that oppened the portal and are now searching for the next one of the 3? 4? - power mad wizards <br/><br/>not sure about the last two. Maybe an elder god and a cabal looking to harness it for psionic powers? <br/><br/>I don't know if this is enough for the next 2-3 sessions. Especially since i don't know for sure where they are going next. Should i make up a adventure front about the holy city of the cleric's god? There still are some gnoll tribes arround i guess. The one in the dungeon wouldn't be the only ones. <br/>Please help me, i am lost. The whole front thing is fairly new to me and seemed easier to do in apocalypse world.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394321">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394321/#Comment_394321" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-22T12:29:11+00:00" title="October 22, 2012 12:29PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You might be better off thinking of fronts as characters or groups of characters with distinct agendas. So, you have the demon in Gregor's head, the fleshy thing, maybe a gnoll leader somewhere, those Will O the Wisp creatures, the one city that was destroyed, the other city that was destroyed (these could be a front each, or they could fragment--maybe the city council from one city is a front, and the apocalyptic cult from the same city is another front?), the balrog that isn't possessing Gregor anymore, and Kratar the dwarfen god of secrets and stuff. And maybe some wizards opening up far realm rifts, too? So lots of stuff.<br/><br/>Pick the ones you think will have the most impact on the PCs in the immediate future. Decide what they want, give them an agenda and impulses. Then decide on a rough plan for them. Write out a sequence of steps, actions they will be attempting to perform over the next little while. This isn't concrete, but it's what you imagine them doing if the PCs don't stop them. Have them reach their final goal in 5 or 6 steps, maybe. This is not just so you have ideas to draw from in play for the PCs to interact with, but also so these agendas can butt up against <i>each other</i>, creating new and interesting combinations for the PCs to interact with. It's not exactly like AW or DW, but I give some advice on this for a different game over <a href="http://www.kult-rpg.com/forum/viewthread.php?tid=4906&amp;title=Reading+Kult+11%3A+The+Gamemaster\\%26%23039%3Bs+Function+Part+1" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://www.kult-rpg.com/forum/viewthread.php?tid=4912&amp;title=Reading+Kult+12%3A+The+Gamemaster\\%26%23039%3Bs+Function+Part+2" rel="nofollow">here</a> that you might find valuable. You may have to skip to about half-way into each post (down to "The Adventure" and "Flowers of Evil," respectively).<br/><br/>Then you need some portents. This is where Call of Cthulhu adventures can be instructive (or, they were to me, anyway). In order to write a CoC mystery, you have a villain and probably a summoning or something. Then you scatter clues in all directions around this central secret, so that investigators should be able to figure out what is happening by tracking down say 40-70% of the total clues (this way you never have that "failed roll that stalls the game" problem). In DW, you can be even more proactive, though, because you can have portents that don't just sit around waiting to be found. Ask yourself: "How do the PCs find out about this front/character/scheme?" There's your portents! You should try and put them in different places if you can, so that which portents the PCs encounter depends on where they go and what decisions they make. Of course, you can always have the PCs friends track them down and be like "doods, shit got heavy!"<br/><br/>In play, you could do something like this: write out each fronts steps on a small card or piece of paper and stack them up. Write some portents on each one. Then, when it's your turn, look over all the steps that are visible. Pick your favourite, and start describing the portents. Or, if the action would affect the PCs, jump right into it. When you're done, remove the step you just used, thus revealing a new one, and look at the steps you have visible now and think about what each front/character/group would do now. How would they react, based on how far along in their plan they are? If something jumps out, do that. If one of the visible steps looks like it should happen now, do that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_394323">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394323/#Comment_394323" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-22T12:49:46+00:00" title="October 22, 2012 12:49PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 22, 2012 12:50PM by Johnstone.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, some concrete ideas:<br/><br/>What about the gnolls? They all got killed right? Balrog-Gregor mopped up the last of them it seems like?<br/><br/>Okay, what about the gnoll leader who sent his sorcerer with some troops on a mission and they never came back? He -- ehm, no, these are hyenas -- <i>she</i> will want to know what went down. So you have:<br/><br/><b>Gnoll Warlord Hunting Party.</b><br/><b>Agenda:</b> To summon a great demon and bind it, to be used against the humans in the upcoming war.<br/><b>Impulses:</b> To fight weaker enemies whenever possible. To scavenge the dead for food and gluttonously indulge. To drink, dance, and howl.<br/><br/><b>Five-Step Plan:</b><br/><br/>1. Investigate the scene. Gnolls come sniffing 'round the old observatory to find out what happened. They will make trouble with locals, raiding farms, molesting travellers (who are apparently pretty numerous now!), and might even fight a few far realms beasties.<br/><br/>2. Establish a base of operations. The gnolls will take over some local fort or castle, and this is where they will attempt to summon and bind another demon (or the same demon if he's still wandering around causing trouble, or Gregor's demon...). This one will be pretty obvious. Their neighbours will know, and there might be survivors from the battle who escaped and are trying to drum up support to retake the fort/castle.<br/><br/>3. Collect magical ingredients. For some reason, this includes blood, hair, nails, and stuff from the PCs! They were there and now the gnolls need some sympathetic tokens from them. They will try to just kill the PCs, and when that proves to be a Herculean task, they will settle for escaping with locks of hair, the blood smeared on their blades, and any possessions the PCs consider valuable. This battle or these tokens might show them that Gregor is possessed...<br/><br/>4. Collect a demon or a sacrifice. They will attempt to capture the balrog, using magical circles, or kidnap Gregor, or they will try to abduct an appropriate sacrifice in the form of a very, very important human being (you know, like a princess or something, use your imagination). They will then bring their captive back to their base of operations, unless it's been destroyed, in which case they will have to try and set up a new ad hoc HQ.<br/><br/>5. Bind a demon. If the gnolls get to this point and the PCs somehow miss it, portents are easy! The skies turn black with roily lightning-belching clouds. Dead crows fly in flocks, circling the ritual. The ground shakes, and monsters roam the roads, converging at the ritual, ready to witness the demon's fall, or serve it should it shake off the chains of sorcery.<br/><br/>And there you go, agenda, plan, and portents, ready to get fucked up by the PCs agency. Depending on what happens, the gnolls will have to regroup, improvise, and adapt. If they suffer setbacks, they might have to go back to step 2 and start all over again. Also, they might come up against other characters or groups and make deals, or change parts of their plan. Also, the balrog might wipe them out or enslave them. Just because they plan to win, doesn't mean they will!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394338">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394338/#Comment_394338" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-22T14:15:58+00:00" title="October 22, 2012  2:15PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I thought up another one.

Show off with magic. Lecture those who are ignorant.<br/><br/><b>5 Step Plan:</b><br/><br/>1. Join the apocalyptic cult. So, this cult was small, but then the city was destroyed. The apocalypse! So this cult is now recruiting, sending representatives wandering around to promote it. And there's rumours that all sorts of scoundrels and questionable people are joining. Their numbers are growing!<br/><br/>2. Take over the apocalypse cult. Strange news in the rumour-mill! The cult has a new leader. Apparently the old leader was deposed via magical combat, in public no less! Maybe the PCs can witness this if they go check out the cult, and they can get caught up in the following riot!<br/><br/>3. Build a temple. Kind-of similar to the gnolls HQ, but what they are really doing is erecting a lodestone to focus the energies of their sorcery. They will of course want someplace where they have political and military control of, which could be an already-existing settlement. Some people are bound to be unhappy about this!<br/><br/>4. Build a perimeter. So they send teams out to erect smaller temples. All over the place, they go, stirring up trouble and conflict. Strange magical occurrences follow them around.<br/><br/>5. Perform the ritual. Once their perimeter is set up, they will perform the ritual, and if the PCs don't stop them, there won't be any more rifts to the far realms, because this land will be <i>merged with the far realms forever!!!!</i> Dun dun dun!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_394397">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394397/#Comment_394397" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-22T23:30:02+00:00" title="October 22, 2012 11:30PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great Advice Johnstone.

But I like to think of my 5-step plans as the fingers of doom and when they are all assembled, the GM gets to lay the hand of doom down on the campaign setting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395277">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Praion" title="Praion"><img alt="Praion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Praion">Praion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395277/#Comment_395277" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-29T11:28:38+00:00" title="October 29, 2012 11:28AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 29, 2012 11:29AM by Praion.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hello again,<br/><br/>i followed your example and created a few new fronts. The dwarfen army, a thiefs guild from the destroyed city and the demon. In our last session there was not much happening as we had not so much time.<br/>My GF entered the game with a ranger and the party quickly fought some gnolls and everyone rolled really well. I think there was one miss and one 7-9 in the whole thing. They made liberal use of kicking gnolls in the balls. <br/>They then went to Kantara, the holy city of the dwarf clerics faith.<br/><br/>We established that it is a lost city of a lost civilisation where the curch moved in. They have a lot of archelogical diggins there. Room for dungeon fun. <br/><br/>They are fresh out of rations as the quartermaster rolled a 4 on his roll for the journey. <br/>A cool thing was the cleric casting "cure light wounds" normaly a fairly small spell and stable of DnD adventureres he started casting with: "i take of my clothes". He then striped out of his robe and armor and meditated in his underwear while praying to his god. Awesome stuff in my mind. <br/>The player still said he wanted to play more of a battle cleric than a magicky type cleric and i offered him to switch to paladin. He has to start at level 1 though. <br/><br/>For the next session i am thinking of a few things. I want to prep a dungeon under the city with formians digging at an ancient big door. Behind the door is one of the secrets of the far realm rift (and a mantikor). <br/><br/>I also thought of using love letters to start the next session but i have little experience with them. I was thinking of this:<br/><br/>Thief:<br/>You snatched up a few things in the week that you stayed here, roll with Dex and pick what you got. <br/>On a 10+ choose 3, on 7-9 choose 1 OR choose 2 but you are put in danger<br/>- 60 gold<br/>- a bag of books<br/>- bandages and healing herbs<br/>- a healing potion<br/>- a pair of amber glasses (help with discern realities) <br/><br/><br/>Cleric/Paladin<br/>Tell us what you told your superios about the mission and roll with Cha. On a hit everything is fine but on a 7-9 choose 1<br/>- They don't want you to go back there<br/>- They don't have a new mission for you <br/><br/>also if you made some research about your and your companions strange light affection tell us how (library? prayer? talk with others?) and roll with an appropriate statt<br/>?????????????? &lt;-- no idea but i want to give him a chance to lift it, at least from the thief<br/><br/><br/>Fighter<br/>You have a demon in your head, do you resist it or argue with it? Roll with Cha or Wis to resist it.<br/>On a 7-9 it is nagging you with an idea you find compelling, choose on of these<br/>- Getting the coral spear from the catacombs under the city<br/>- Stopping the incursion of "the other side" by hunting demon(summoners)<br/>- Getting revenge of the Gnolls that tricked you <br/>- You must find you old master Hawk and confront him<br/><br/>Ranger<br/>You have gone hunting for rations amiright? Tell us what you hunted and roll with Dex. On a 10+ you came back with d8+2 rations on a 7-9 choose 1 from the list<br/>- It cost you, you lost d8 hitpoints in the struggle<br/>- Someone found you too and is no hunting for you <br/>- You where not that successfull, you get only a d6 worth of rations<br/><br/>You could have also picked some healing herbs if you like. <br/><br/>Are those okay? I wanted to give them a way for new plot and a bit of time to regain their stuff and be cool. Maybe something more for the fighter that shows us what a cool fighter he is...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
