<a href="http://blog.kumapageworks.org/blog/?p=85" rel="nofollow">Cross-posted from my blog:</a>
<p>I'm finally posting this - it's been sticking in my craw for a while now.  Over at Story-Games (not a member - you should be, you know!) I was talking about the cohorts I wanted to get together for Ludolab.  In the commentary in the thread, there was this, from Shreyas Sampat (he of <a href="http://www.geocities.com/torchbearer_rpg/index.html" rel="nofollow">Four Willows Weeping</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure I like [the Frankengame cohort] or setting design; <strong>who needs setting</strong>? I guess I see their potential for other people, though.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[OK, my browser crashed while I was writing this - I'm going to cut back to the chase with this.]</p>
<p>Setting design and game design share a lot of ground - I believe that setting design (i.e. worldbuilding) is the primary means by which game <em>players</em> become <em>content-generators</em>, at least in the tabletop arena.</p>
<p>That aside, what this quote says to me is that setting = 100% color.  It's just a fancy dressing that you hang over the system, and it doesn't need to be 'designed'.</p>
<p>I think that's wrong on two counts - first of all, setting (any <em>good</em> setting, at least) involves <em>system</em> - physical, social, economic and so-forth.  I'm not just talking about verisimilitude-rich settings like HÃƒÂ¢rn or Monte Cooke's shelf-breaker Ptolus, either.  Any setting has systems on which it depends, and of which the players either inherently understand (because they're similar to everyday life, or they're a subject of common interest), or which they learn through play in order for their characters to function well.  If the setting doesn't make sense, or its too superficial and static, the players will sense it instinctually.</p>
<p>Secondly, big-S System springs from the setting - or at least it should.  No guns in medieval France, so no gun rules - this is a trivial example, but an apt one.  Whether or not a game calls for a token mechanic, a bidding mechanic or a die mechanic can also be determined by setting - the conflict takes place in a world-system that is either commerical (requiring some sort of sense of the word 'purchase'), contested (requiring an escalating stake), or random.</p>
<p>Certainly there are games where these systems are either beside the point, or minimized because the game involves what I'd call a 'staged' setting (either the physical surroundings or the conceptual underpinnings are artificially closed).  A game like Shreyas' <em><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=402" rel="nofollow">Snow from Korea</a></em> is a good example of this.  But even in <em>Snow from Korea</em>, there are cultural elements which must be understood by the players - they are samurai in the court of the Daimyo - which come, ultimately, from the setting of the game.</p>
<p>So setting <em>is </em>important, and everyone needs a little bit of it.  Certainly, the curriculum for Ludolab will be aimed at creating <em>dynamic</em> settings - it won't just be a course on how to draw coastlines.  As much as system is a part of the setting, so is situation.  Creating settings that are built on and nuture Situation <em>explicitly</em> are the next iteration of the idea.</p> </div>

                            Or the setting can spring from the big S-System. No gun rules? Then the setting shouldn't have guns.<br/><br/>Settings in this kind of forum(not the internet, the social kind), often do or at least benefit from taking Judd(Paka)'s way. Setting designed by questions. Yes, setting is there for the players to be content-generators.<br/>Fuck yes, that's all it's there for.

Both - the GM/players should enforce the setting (with various amounts of player input from free-for-all to the GM writing it all); the game should <i>reinforce</i> the GM/players, and if they deviate from the published setting, at the very least lay down and be quiet.  At best, it should actively aid in helping the GM/players modify itself.                        </div>

I can not see how this is both. You say the GM/Players should enforce the setting, and the system should help them do so? In this way it is not directly the system that enforces the setting. Or have I misunderstood you?<br/><br/>The way I see it, is, if the GM (and, yes, the players too) enforces the setting, then nothing in the setting is just colour, because everything can be brought in as a dramatic element in the game, if the GM/Players wishes to do so.<br/><br/> - Anders                        </div>

<p>What are the properties of a setting that is not "just color"? (Note that I think the phrase "just color" is kinda dumb, 'cause it marginalises color, which is possibly the most important of all things.)</p>

                            One of the elements we consider core to the roleplaying experience is generating fictional content- Setting is the initial fictional content to get us started, and provide an example of what would further fit in play.  It helps us generate focused imaginary elements, whether we're talking Character, Color, or Situation.<br/><br/>For example, if you're playing PTA, you still need to nail down what the series is about so that everyone can make appropriate characters, appropriate Issues, and good Situation from all of that.<br/><br/>So it becomes crucial to either provide Setting initially, or tools to produce setting.  You can find play clashes when included setting is either contradictory or poorly written, OR when the System doesn't support it well.<br/><br/>But, all that fancy talk aside- Setting &amp; Color are <i>what sparks the imagination and sell people on most games</i>.  Only system monkeys like myself drool when you show me the tools, most everyone else just wants to see what they're supposed to have as the end result...  <br/><br/>It's easier for me to try to sell someone on playing Eberron rather than Sorcerer or GURPS, because Eberron instantly conjures an image in their head and they already begin imagining what they would do with it, whereas the latter two require system familiarity and doesn't suggest anything by itself...                        </div>

                            Dammit, Chris, I was going to be all clever and wise but you said nearly everything that I was going to say.<br/><br/>As an old GURPShead, I don't find <em>published</em> setting to be important.  Like, at all.  In fact I consider most published settings to be negative characteristics of a game book, and I am less likely to buy.<br/><br/>That said, setting is <em>of course</em> essential for actual play.  You quite simply can't play without it.  Setting gives context to both characters and situation, and whenever you have either of the latter, you automatically have the former.<br/><br/>As Chris points out, though, a book can provide a pre-written setting or it can provide tools to create a setting for play.  Neither one are necessary, but you must have one or the other.<br/><br/>(Hm.  Does Risus get unqualified for being a roleplaying game under that definition?  Interesting.)                        </div>

                            Josh, <br/><br/>Risus gives you cliche, which leads unto genre, which leads unto setting. <br/><br/>I just don't think it gives you a way to clearly and easily understand how all the whacky cliches that the group brings together form a genre, or a setting... but as most people play it for jokes it tends to not matter much if your Vampire Princess is tagging along with the Space Caveman. <br/><br/>Or maybe it's just all anime....<br/><br/><br/>Anyway, I don't usually give a crap about published setting anymore. (Well I do, but only when I'm in geek mode, not when I'm in "actually thinking about actual game" mode.) I like systems that help you generate your own setting up front, or at best give the kind of genre guidelines you need to make setting coherently as you play. This is because I agree with Kuma's statement that setting is the primary way you make players content generators -- and I want to start with that generation as early, as freely, and as fundementally to the game as possible.                        </div>

                            Well, an RPG needs a setting. As a designer, you either design the setting (as in the case of TSoY or Dogs in the Vineyard) or you design a way to design the setting (the World Burner from Burning Wheel or the Grid from Shock:).<br/>
<br/>
A published setting had better be actually interesting, though: it had better make me want to confront its problems and revel in its glory and emerge from each story with a changed world.<br/>
<br/>
To do that, the setting, however it's devised, must be built to turn static setting into dynamic situation. When that happens, your setting design does its magic.                        </div>

                            Is there seriously a way to totally divorce system and setting?  I don't think there is.  You can have a system which doesn't define all or most of the setting, but it'll still define some of it.  Even something like PTA defines part of the setting: 'it's a television show'.<br/>
<br/>
Setting = color + situation.  System can ignore color but rarely situation.  You can have aspects of the setting which are separate from the system, but not vice versa.                        </div>

                            Well, Selene, why are you killing those monsters? Most D&amp;D games I've participated in have some sort of Big Bad at the end who you're trying to get at, presumably saving the world, or the town, or some such.<br/><br/>But you're right: in a purely Gamist sense, given that players are completely uninterested in anything greater than a tactical experience, setting can show you the game pieces, yeah. As soon as they're interested in the <i>strategic</i> level of the story, though, that's when it goes back to my demand.<br/><br/>For instance, Ming the Merciless always escapes. Dale is rescued again, and the story never really <i>goes</i> anywhere. In this case, the setting (even though it's being constantly created and revealed) is a constant.<br/><br/>As soon as Ming can really, truly be defeated, you can, and must, change the setting to keep up with events. It's a purely Gamist concern where victory conditions change the setting.                        </div>

                            I am tired of buying settings! There are a whole pile of settings sitting on my shelf, and they are all interesting to read, and will basically never get used in any game I'm ever likely to play.<br/><br/>The published settings I have enjoyed playing most are the ones that are minimally presented. Just enough text to whet my imagination. Something small enough that even the laziest player will read. The text in <i>Polaris</i> struck me as just about perfect.<br/><br/>Telling me how much setting I/we need to build before play? Perfect.<br/><br/>Basically, I'm only interested in setting to the degree that it informs premise.                        </div>

                            Navi, where'd you get your equation, there?  Setting is more than color and situation.  It's also context, and the characters come from setting (although you can easily say they come from situation, which is a subset of setting).                        </div>

                            Characters that matter are part of situation. Background characters are the same as trees, mountains, and chairs: they're the color that makes everything come alive; the stuff that gives a sense that the world is alive and pregnant with possibility.<br/>
<br/>
Anything that gives context but doesn't directly contribute to theme or challenge is color, Josh. Just because it's important to establish context doesn't make it non-color.                        </div>

                            Yeah, and that's context. It's also color, but it's color that's not very interesting.<br/>
<br/>
Let's say your story takes place in a city. Presumably, there are crowds of people. Presumably, those crowds of people are made of individuals. As long as there's enough detail to make that clear so everyone's not asking "Why is this city empty?" that's color, and all you need is to know that they're there.<br/>
<br/>
(unless, you know, you're trying to find someone in the crowd, or there's a riot. Then the crowd is intimately involved in Situation.)<br/>
<br/>
Chances are, you're in a city because that's a good place to have the Situation that makes the story happen. That imaginary crowd is Color that gives context to the Situation.                        </div>

                            Hey Kuma,<br/><br/>I agree with you. I <a href="http://urdwell.blogspot.com/2006/02/algebra-of-setting-in-rpgs.html" rel="nofollow"> a while back. I'm mainly focused on protagonist play (or narrativist play if you prefer), so I'm not claiming my ideas account for other creative agendas. <br/><br/>For what's it's worth, if I can introduce a couple equations of my own:<br/>Color + Character + System = Setting<br/><br/>Setting + Situation + Player = Story<br/><br/>As Kuma and others have stated, I think the links between system and setting are so tight as to be practically inseparable.<br/><br/>Guns are setting in a Western RPG or Napoleonic Naval RPG, and they are expressed mechanically. Trust and betrayal can also be setting in a game about honor (like The Mountain Witch), and that is expressed mechanically too. Swords, armor, magic, technology, and so forth are all just as important to setting as who the current king is or what megacorp is working on a new super drug.<br/><br/>Our experience with Burning Wheel has led the Burning Wheel team to believe that collaborative setting/campaign creation is the most powerful way to create the kinds of campaigns that we want to play. It serves multiple purposes:<br/>1. It gets everyone on the same page and really invested in the place we've created because they own the color and are able to contribute the stuff that jazzes them.<br/>2. If done correctly, it creates and informs situation. Situation is perhaps the most important element of a campaign, whether it's intended to be one session long or last for years.<br/>3. The color and the situtation inform character. The players will create colorful characters designed to tackle the situation. <br/><br/>Taken together, this stuff should really drive players to proactive play.</a> </div>

                            Thanks Matt!<br/>
<br/>
Jihad's World Burner was an expression of it  in rules form, an attempt to take what Pete and I have been doing at our tables and express it in the rules.<br/>
<br/>
HeroQuest did something similar with its Clan Generator from Orlanth Is Dead!, a supplement for the Sartar Rising campaign. Pretty neat stuff that I've been playing with in my current HeroQuest game. I was also influenced a lot by Aria: Canticle of the Monomyth, which was problematic at best but had some really interesting setting-creation ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously, we don't have anything like the World Burner  yet for Burning Wheel proper, so it's a little less refined for our fantasy games. For my current campaign, we generated about four pitches. I threw in one as the GM and the players contributed ideas as well. We selected one through concensus and added bits of the others that we felt would fit well.<br/>
<br/>
Then I asked a series of World Burner-like questions. The first few questions are intended to generate the color that invest the players in the game. The next few questions are about taking the color that players were the most excited about and  helping it evolve into situation.<br/>
<br/>
The last few questions were about evoking characters designed to attack that situation from multiple angles. Then we chose characters and the rest became antagonists and supporting cast.                        </div>
