Just for context/terminology, the Chiens are the "watchdogs" (hence "dogs", in French "chiens") of the Committee for Public Safety in this "Terror that never was", as the Committe has created a national system of Commissioners (Stewards) nationally, with the order of the watchdogs to of course safeguard the Revolution (i.e., conduct the Terror, but also of course also grant mercy and instruction as needed). <br/>\n<br/>\nJana was also in this game, playing Jean-Luc de la For\xeat (I may have the last name wrong of the PC), simple and hardy farming young man and revolutionary, salt of the Earth, inspired to become a dog. Jean-Luc is truly in touch with nature and also has a thinly-suppresed vengeance streak, especially against the Royalist enemies of the Revolution, as she believes it was they who burned down her family's farm as her parents were tax resistors as the Revolution began. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis alrready created a great contrast to Matthew's Henri Phillip and Gareth's Emile d'Estaing, both of whom came from Royalist-but-converted backgrounds! Henri's family's lands were, of course, repossessed by the people, and his father killed himself over a tax dispute. The mother raised Henri, who seemed to talk to "imaginery" demons and was soon selected by observant government people as the right kind of person to become a Dog; Henri is a servant of the wrath of justice. <br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile, Emile - whose family it turns out was actually behind the tax dispute/financial ruin of Henir's family - is the son of an aristocrat who has totally disavowed and disowned that background, enlightened to join the Revolution, and who actually completely hides and tries to bury his past, and is trying to constantly prove himself as faithful to the cause. <br/>\n<br/>\nTheir Accomplishment rounds were all really strong, the players (2 totally new to Dogs) took really well to that compared to many new to the game, and so we had Henri clear his father's name (and of course face accusations of being a Royalist in his heart; I like how he tied it back to Emile's family), Jean-Luc prove he could be urbane and sophisticated (given his country bumpkin background; this had a great scene and kudos to Jana for making a Trait of "Loud, snorting laugh that's effective" useful, and even graduating from 1d4 to 1d6), and Emile prove he could get by without servants around (great scene as former servants try to lynch him and Gareth gives a great speech pointing out that to kill him now would ruin any potential he'd have that these servants invested into him and which could serve the Revolution now, I can't do it justice at the moment but I really liked that). <br/>\n<br/>\nThe 3 new Dogs go to the town of Landersheim and face a heresy where forces have taken over from the old Commissioner, and an inspired Revolutionary, a latter-day Joan of Arc basically, Stephanie d'Alesia believes she has been inspired by the Lord (remember, Robespierre and his ilk were Deists, so Christianity of sorts is actually part of the Revolution in this game) that the Revolution has truly reached all the people and "anyone" can be a Dog AND Commissioner at once, that the Parisian elitist system does not apply and anyone receives direct inspiration from the Lord to fill these roles. Henri is disgusted with this "anarchy" while Jean-Luc thinks perhaps this town is in fact carrying the Revolution to its next level, at least suitable locally, and Gareth is conflicted, wanting to support the people but wanting to be orthodox as a Dog.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147493">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zornwil" title="zornwil"><img alt="zornwil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zornwil">zornwil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147493/#Comment_147493" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T00:07:08+00:00" title="June  3, 2008 12:07AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 3, 2008 2:28AM by zornwil.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Part 2 of 2:<br/>\n<br/>\nWithout going through the whole story, the players did a great job of immediately debating and arguing over their stances, soon coming into Conflicts, and this really got intrigueing when they got into a Conflict over whether to relieve Stephanie of her Commissioner duties, Jean-Luc at first taking Stephanie's siding and trying to stop Henri, while Emile at first is cautious and shifting as it goes, watching the Raises and Sees. But soon Emile at least believes they should relieve Stephanie, even if he draws no greater conclusion, and as Stephanie and the mob threaten and imprison Emile and Henri, Jean-Luc soon moves to keep her fellow Dogs safe as the primary motivation. And finally, having broken out of prison (all during the same Conflict - Dog is cool!), Emile does a very Revolution-style thing, reminding me of the death of Marat in a way, in shooting Stephanie in the back! But it's brutal, and the PCs actually Give, letting Stephanie stay as Commisioner.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut that final volley of flintlock fire is so brutal that Stephanie lies dying, bleeding to death, and here the Dogs pass their final judgement - "let nature take its course." Stephanie's husband and the (very) few of the mob with any remaining courage against the Dogs are kept away from Stephanie as she bleeds to death in front of them (how Terror-like)! So justice is served; they appoint a new Commissioner, an old mentor to Jean-Luc who is in the town now and who used to actually be a big supporter of Stephanie's, making sure the old mentor agrees to be orthodox and be "just" the Commissioner with no one else in the town serving as Commissioners or Dogs. Cool beans! I really enjoyed this game and especially the players, and I think the town "works" (it's sort of based on a conversation I once had with Carl about a town of all Dogs, and I think there was discussion on this on the Forge as well).<br/>\n<br/>\nSee also index of my various GPNW game commentaries at http://www.story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=147473 ([Go Play NW2008] It's Over! # 26)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zornwil" title="zornwil"><img alt="zornwil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zornwil">zornwil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147519/#Comment_147519" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T02:46:17+00:00" title="June  3, 2008  2:46AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 3, 2008 2:46AM by zornwil.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This game also is starting to echo loudly in my head, and I'd like to share another bit of it.  A good bit of detail, I hope you enjoy it, or if not it at least is good actual play documentation for any researchers/analysts.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the way into Landersheim, the Dogs note the peasants of the small farming community (which is now rife with famine due to the failure of wheat, along with a threat of wolves) are wearing hastily-improvised, oft-atrocioius Dogs-like coats and caps and cockades and cloaks and capes (the Dogs of the Terror are a flamboyant sort!). <br/>\n<br/>\nThey quickly move to the Town Hall to ask after the Commissioner, whom they are informed has been replaced - and imprisoned.  Most of the able males and females of the village are Commissioners, divinely inspired, and from there they learn this doctrine of anyone can be directly divinely inspired and is equal to act.  Essentially, the ideal of communism' or anarchy, depending a bit on how you look at it (I don't want to get into a sociopolitical argument, I do understand distinctions, I just want to give a broad brush feel).  There is a woman who is effectively albiet not nominally in charge, the prior-post-mentioned Stephanie d'Alesia.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAsking after the imprisioned prior (depending on how you look at things) Commissioner, Pierre Gaston, they find that it turned out the was sending love letters with revealing information to a Royalist woman in the Bastille.  The Dogs debate amongst themelves but as I recall while some were more vehement than others all were united in agreeing it was deplorable if true and he would be unfit to be Commissioner if anything were revealing in those letters.  I can't recall exactly, but I think on the matter of having just sent them at all there were divergent views but it wasn't something discussed too much.  I might be wrong here in some details.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the Dogs heatedly argue over this notion of direct divine inspiration bypassing the state authority, the expression of the people's will.  The players were SO awesome here, they TOTALLY glommed onto the little bits of Robespierre and Jacobin philsoophy, and they threw around comments on the "social contract" and an "enlightened minrotiy," only a couple times even pausing to ask me "hey, what was that bit you told us before where some people could act...", those sorts of things.  I was really struck, I should say, and when the game was over, now that I realize it, I never had said anything to the players, so if you read this, folks, you were totally awesome here, you blew me away, I was tickled pink!  It's a great memory. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, as Henri angrily and loudly uses the word "anarchy" in describing what was happening, it reaches Stephanie d'Alesia's ears as the Dogs are inside a foyer near the hall she inhabits in Town Hall.  It takes her a few moments to come out, as the Dogs continue to argue, again  more quietly, but soon she comes out, and asks after the accusation.  She is a bold and charismatic woman, or at least I think that got across to the players (I mean, I wanted to be clear, so I outright said that's how people would commonly perceive her, not to say their characters can react however).  Basically here she goes through the spiel supporting the doctrine and (I hope) demonstrating passion for the Revolution.  Jean-Luc is taken with her approach, Henri is outraged, and Emile is receptive to hearing more, but not quite as sympathetic as Jean-Luc (whom, it should be said, is not saying Stephanie is correct, Jana doesn't play him buying all the way into it, just being very receptive to this botoms-up approach).  <br/>\n<br/>\nOh, I really should go to bed, but these thoughts are spilling out of my  head and I need to get them recorded....<br/>\n<br/>\n(I think I'll run out of post so I'm splitting this into a next one)....                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zornwil" title="zornwil"><img alt="zornwil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zornwil">zornwil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147522/#Comment_147522" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T03:18:43+00:00" title="June  3, 2008  3:18AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 3, 2008 3:19AM by zornwil.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At some point around here or a bit earlier, I'm fairly sure it came up quite a while before Stephanie arrived, as soon as they came in Town Hall, but without so many details yet as we just hadn't gotten to it yet, more discussion was had about Pierre Gaston, the former Commissioner, and the love letters.  A Jacques Walter - coincidentally a former servant of Emile's - was serving Pierre in secreting letters to the Bastille for her (I forget her name now).  Stephanie's husband (I also forget his name off-hand) saw Jacques leaving the town at quite an odd, late hour, and reported it, and soon people asked Jacques, who spilled the beans.  And they have the last letter, too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter all this stage, things start getting intense.  While the Dogs were arguing before, there weren't any clear conflicts, just a lot of learning how each other thinked and feeling each other out, and of course the characters become painted for us (again, really nice work here by the players).  But the question of accommodations comes up, as Stephanie offers up finding them a place to stay (she is also fairly gracious to the PCs, but (at least, again depending on one's interpretation) a bit presumptious given she refers to them as "peers").  Henri immediately says they're staying at the Town Hall, taking it over.  The Dogs then retire to a private conversation after a few exchanged words!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Conflict ensues, "Do we take over Town Hall?" with the Stakes clarified so that whichever player won, they stated basically as part of that whether they were basically accepting what Stephanie offered, in other words, resolving where they stayed, as that was the minor issue, the primary one being whether they imposed their will and placing so directly.  Henri is in the minority as Jean-Luc and Emile feel they should hang back and simply, basically, not rock the boat at least just yet, get the feel of things and then decide, that it might be hasty.  The only thing I feel could have gone better here was that everyone was so into it they blurted out the best arguments (and I the best "just so you know.." comments to, ahem, balance things, i.e., goad) that it mostly got said before actual dice got rolled, and I didn't reel back words as much as I could.  But that didn't matter much from an enjoyment level really in that regardless it was great roleplaying and the Conflict proper was good, too.  In the Conflict, though, it was very swift, as Henri was especially convinced after Emile indicated it would be too much of an effontery to the entire mob of the village, too presumptious in perhaps their percpetion, and thus creating unnecessary danger in carrying out the mission of saving Landersheim.  As the group had already discussed, Emile referred to that given they don't know the situation yet and they can judge anytime, there's no rush.  Gareth was persausive here in playing Emile, and Matthew decided to Give - given he reached his turn, could hold his die, and had collected experience (powergamer!  I say that kindly).  Seriously, Matthew's moment of gaming the system (the way Vincent Baker intended) was a true meld with the roleplaying, it worked excellently as the reflection of Gareth really adding onto arguments Jara made for their characters, during which Matthew did take Fallout for his character, and it did make sense Henri would see the points - but give on his terms, focusing on their duty being successful and this making tactical sense, and continuing to swagger proudly that he and they were Dogs still superior to Stephanie.<br/>\n<br/>\n(ran out of room, next post...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zornwil" title="zornwil"><img alt="zornwil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zornwil">zornwil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147523/#Comment_147523" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T03:18:59+00:00" title="June  3, 2008  3:18AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (continued)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo they accepted lodgings in what was the former Catholic church, where "only" 4 others were inhabiting, Stephanie apologizng it was the best they could do but assuring them it had a great fireplace and they would at least be war.  So the PCs accepted, and they proceed to immediately see Pierre Gaston (ex-Commissioner).  Pierre is not treated well but that's because of the dire poverty, there's so little to give anyone let alone the prisoner.  He is outraged and calls on the Dogs to punish Stephanie and the others, but he also admits he truly is in love with the woman, and says that as it is true love, how can it be wrong simply to communicate one's feelings?  And he denies anything revealed is so meaningful, that references to "a few troops having passed through" is innocuous in this day and age when there are troops all over France.  The Dogs are united in feeling even such passing references (which they substantiate by seeing the letter) are a huge violation at least from a person of his responsibility and all agree he will not be Commissioner anymore; I'll have to check my notes, which are not handy now (I'm on a different computer), as to what they decided to do with him in the end.  In any event, they do leave him in jail.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, it's way too late, I'm going to have to give some more details later on the final confrontation with Stephanie mentioned way above in posts.  I think I'll hold onto that fine enough, because I'm planting these seeds here:  the exploding ex-Catholic church with the munitions dump shooting shrapnel/gunfire into Henri and Emile (and Emile's and Jean-Luc's sacrifice maneuvers), the mob scene, I don't recall the prison break well even now unfortunately, and then after the shooting-in-the-back the come-back with Henri's sacrifice).  But before that there was the scene with the ex-hermit, Jean-Luc's old mentor, where he returns with the dead wolves.  That would be the rest of the story.  Oh, except for the accomplishments, have to think more on those, but we do have to remember to tell the story of how Emile lost 2 fingers...<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a GM, this is one of those games that makes it not only worthwhile but I think I have the most fun at the table, because the players just go.  I just give them information and characters I had to do some prework for, but in game I don't have to do all that much work, all things considered.  At least not with players like this, I mean, who grab it and go.  The players said the town was good, they all thought it got people thinking.  I didn't put this above, but one of the important things here that I think really supported this                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147583">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zornwil" title="zornwil"><img alt="zornwil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zornwil">zornwil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147583/#Comment_147583" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T07:53:18+00:00" title="June  3, 2008  7:53AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whoops, pardon that incomplete thought above, what I meant to finish with was that what supported this was setting up certain Relationships in advance to people in the town worked.  I'd seen Carl do this prior, and read of it elsewhere.  I asked the players to define any Relationships in advance and then I tried to map those into people I already had in the town scenario, although in particular I let them define the type of people and then I looked through the villagers or if I could inserted them into the village in a supporting role as it made sense.  So as Jara wanted a hermit mentor who had helped Jean-Luc learn the ways of the forest, I inserted him as having moved nearby Landersheim and as Stephanie inspired the people to go out and defend the village against the wolves and work harder in farming and using the land, he became inspired by seeing the community so self-inspired.  I'll talk more about that later, but for now the point is that having these people inserted into the town whether matching them to someone already in the setting or adding them does help the players have focus and interest and gives the GM ways to create sympathies or challenges or loyalty issues for the PCs and therefore players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthew_SB" title="Matthew_SB"><img alt="Matthew_SB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthew_SB">Matthew_SB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147690/#Comment_147690" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T12:36:44+00:00" title="June  3, 2008 12:36PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 3, 2008 12:56PM by Matthew_SB.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wilson, thanks for writing this up, and thanks loads for running this for us!  As mentioned elsewhere, I was initially apprehensive about the setting, but those misgivings happily evaporated immediately at the table.  You did a great job presenting what was needed to get rolling, and the alternate history definitely has enough room for non-history buffs to flex and strut with glee.  Props.<br/><br/>I played Henri at the table, and enjoyed that immensely.  I had played my first dog the day before, and that game definitely colored my Chien in this game, so I hope you'll indulge a digression here.  Micah, the Dog I played Saturday, was defiant of authority and really fairly forgiving of sinners and tolerant of outsiders.  I think I made Henri so obsessed with the power structure and authority of the Council to play out the other side of that coin.  Also because it gave me a focused point to tie Henri to the situation in a setting I was less familiar with.<br/><br/>Some high points for me:<br/>First riding into the town and seeing all these...peasants...with mock Chien cloaks on.  Oh, yeah, that was a bit shocking, and I was sorely tempted to have Henri start rounding them up at gunpoint then and there.  But the other Chien just kept riding to town hall, cool as you'd like, which just made it more tense.  There was no conflict in that, just the feeling that Henri was getting wound up tighter as he had to turn a blind eye to heresy.  For now.  I think a lot of that tension was internal for me, so I thought I'd share it here in hindsight.<br/><br/>The ideological conflict between Henri and Jean-Luc was stirring.  I really felt like there was some weight to the arguments.  I definitely personally sympathize with Jean-Luc's position, focused as it was on what was best for the people.  But Henri's position was very clear for me, that being a Chien charged with enforcing the laws and securing the authority of the Council.  The clash of those two viewpoints felt really valid.<br/><br/>I also loved when Henri threw his body before Emile to protect him from the explosion(helping dice).  I was unsure how those two characters would end up, given the complicated family histories, so I was really pleased to have that come up.<br/><br/>Stephanie was a super antagonist.  Her position was strong and empathetic, even though it conflicted with the Council.  That was very grippy.  In truth, I cannot imagine her sorcerer husband being a more engaging antagonist, even if we had tangled with him more directly.  Very nice.  And do not forget the red-white-and-blue eyes!<br/><br/>One thing that I thought was very cool in the last conflict was the way the Chiens(and Stephanie) shifted in how they relate to each other, but without actually changing their positions.  Jean-Luc wasn't convinced that it wouldn't be great for everyone to be a commissioner.  Henri still believed that a strong central authority is critical.  And I don't think either of the two really convinced Emile that they were right.  But still by the end all three were united against the strong antagonist.  Perhaps that was to protect the people, or the Council, or the brotherhood of the Chien.  But we started the conflict on opposite sides(or undecided), and ended it unified.  And it is very cool that the system not only accommodates that, but supports it.

I just wanted to say thanks in particular for sharing those insights, although I think you well demonstrated Henri's unease at least in general as the Chiens came to town, it's nice to get the degree of that and your in-character thoughts.  It's always hard, especially in limited-time con games, to get at all that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJust an aside/comment on the role of the husband.  As you say, he's really not so engaging a personality or even enemy as Stephanie.  I want to leave open the question as to the divinity of Stephanie's inspiration, as of course the Chiens have to decide that, and Stephanie's husband is important "only" in his pride and envy triggering one of the earlier sins in the chain of sins that sets up the town for les Chiens when they arrive.  And it, I hope anyway, should nicely leave open the question for any Chiens' positons to be justified in whichever direction the players want to go; after all, while he has been an selfishly-intentended, at least in part, whisperer in Stephanie's ear, one still can interpret that Stephanie's inspiration of the entire village is divine.  As you suggest, Matthew, it seemed to me that Jean-Luc was still unconvinced at the end as to whether what Henri and, eventually, Emile saw as clear heresy was necessarily so heretical.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn that light, I do wonder if I made Stephanie too agressive to the point of driving the players together, perhaps, but the way the conflict ran I feel like that's the way she would play it, and it was certainly open to Jana playing Jean-Luc as seeing Stephanie's terrifying blow against Emile and Henri as the judgement of the almighty even, perhaps even appreciating that of course Jean-Luc remained immune, as did all of Stephanie's faithful, to the blast of the church blowing up.  Especially considering Jana started calling on the demons to help the side of good before that!  And boy is that a cool note she played there, very much to me that aspect of the Terror and Robespierre in real life where as the Terror got going, increasingly the ends justified any means at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147847">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zornwil" title="zornwil"><img alt="zornwil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zornwil">zornwil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147847/#Comment_147847" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T22:03:41+00:00" title="June  3, 2008 10:03PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Filling in a few more details as I said I would above...<br/>\n<br/>\nJust as les Chiens complete the interrogation of Pierre Gaston, they hear the churchbells ringing and a loud hue and cry from the streets.  They go out to see what is going on, finding that while some in the mob yield as one would expect to them, others do not, treating them as equals and not giving way.  Still, les Chiens are powerful and it doesn't take that long to force their way through the crowd to see a cart with a few men on it and 3 dead wolves.  The townspeople are excited given the danger these wolves presented, but also because the famine is so severe the meat from these wolves will be of great value.  Jean-Luc recognizes that leading the men is Jean Benoit, the (now ex-)hermit who was his mentor.  He does not wear a Chien's coat or such, but it is quickly clear he is inspired by Stephanie and the movement in town as he cheers her for the success of their hunt, and otherwise praises her.  Jean-Luc calls to Jean and the old friends are reunited, kissing on each cheek.<br/>\n<br/>\nCatching up, Jean-Luc finds that Jean had moved from the old area given the collateral damage from the farmlands' burning down.  He ended up near Landersheim, and until just the last few days had retained his hermit ways.  But he saw the townspeople suddenly more fervent, more coordinated in their hunts after the menacing wolves, and he saw them otherwise trying as well to do their best to survive with great sense of community - and Revolution.  He joined them, inspired by that.  He accredits Stephanie with unveiling this revelation of direct divine inspiration to position.  And most importantly, he is able to give the townspeople better skills and organization.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring this time, les Chiens listen to the villagers, feeling them out.  While the large majority seem truly enthusiastic and supportive of Stephanie, others though do quietly grumble.  It also turns out that some people who have opposed this idea have been imprisoned and will be tried and likely guilotined as enemies of the Revolution (remember, this is a common punishment for opposing the doctrine of a Chien, and so in a sense this isn't so extraordinary, but does show the seriousness they're taking this with).  Les Chiens also confirm that Stephanie is the central decision maker, with her husband most often present.  Apparently there is already a debate among the townfolk as to have more people involved in decision-making, but no conclusions yet as this "new phase" of the Revolution is so new.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147850">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zornwil" title="zornwil"><img alt="zornwil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zornwil">zornwil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147850/#Comment_147850" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T22:17:24+00:00" title="June  3, 2008 10:17PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's after this that les Chiens return to debating the issue of Stephanie's leadership and this new doctrine arising.  The debate is heated as before.  They cannot agree as to whether to depose Stephanie, with Henri and Jean-Luc again representing the extremes.  They do also first discuss the possibility of appointing Jean Benoit as a Commissioner, as he seems to have his act together, despite being engaged in the (to some) heresy.  As an aside, I was surprised that they considered Jean to be the new Commissioner, and in fact did end up appointing him so in the end as mentioned early in this thread.  I never thought of that.  And while it's clear he's well-skilled, I didn't really see the leap to him being the counsellor to and leader of the people locally, so that was interesting.  It actually was ingenius, because with he being very much a man of the people he's immediately acceptable, so long as tractable.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, as les Chiens cannot agree, a Conflict is invoked, "Will Stephanie be unseated?"  I mentioned this in general before, here I just want to say a few salient things on the Conflict.  The opening was interesting as Jean-Luc and Henri tussled, Henri charging to the door of the Town Hall to grab Stephanie and pull her out, Jean-Luc grabbing and blocking Henri!  Imagine this playing out right in front of the villagers, quite a scene.  <br/>\n<br/>\nStephanie was also in this Conflict, and I wish I remember the details better, but anyway there's a point where, as Matthew mentions, Stephanie's eyes turn red, white, and blue, and her hair starts to rise in an unnatural wind, as her unnatural powers manifest, and she calls on God (but who is answering?) to stop those opposing the Revolution.  The Catholic church turns out to have a munitions dump in the basement, and that suddenly blows, sending stone, powder, and schrapnel inexplicably only against those who have opposed Stephanie (it catches a few townsfolk who had grumbled before as well).  Henri steps to try to save Emile, effectively shielding him from grave harm; Matthew lent Gareth a die.  Now, at this point, I can't recall if Jara stepped in here to try to reduce the harm or if at this point she just stood back for the moment, but she either did at this point or later during the mob scene I'll get to below.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs mentioned earlier in the thread, Jara has Jean-Luc also call on the demons on her turn!  Sadly, I can't remember the exact Raise associated with that, but I believe Jean-Luc was punching Henri at that point, if I recall more or less.  Remember, Jean-Luc is a big, bruiser of a guy.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and when the church went up and they realized it was due to a munitions dump, the players made some good jokes in the spirit of their characters about that not being such great sleeping quarters now that they know that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSomewhere later here Stephanie calls on the mob to imprison Emile and Henri.  Jean-Luc at least at this point if not earlier tries to keep them from harm, and the attack is not so dangerous as the attempt, per Stephanie, is merely to detain, not hurt them.  The mob is large, too (in this case just reflected with her Trait, "I control the mobs, 1d10"), and overwhelms them, hauling them into jail with the Commissioner.  <br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, I don't recall how they escape, but as I recall Jara has Jean-Luc assist with a distraction (or maybe Jean-Luc simply walked in, as the locals trusted him for having been on their side?), with Jara lending a die here.  It was here the tide really started turning, not only as les Chiens started working more together, but also as Stephanie's big Traits were mostly in, with only a 1d10 "I fear nothing" which comes up when Emile makes his way behind her to shoot her in the back.  As Stephanie makes her last stand, turning to fire her flintlock, if I recall correctly, Emile returns Henri's favor and jumps to deflect a bullet to save Henri's life.  But throughout this, Henri and Emile took significant damage, it seemed anyway, and Jean-Luc took a little.  <br/>\n<br/>\n(this barely missed fitting, continued below...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zornwil" title="zornwil"><img alt="zornwil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zornwil">zornwil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147851/#Comment_147851" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T22:17:33+00:00" title="June  3, 2008 10:17PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Les Chiens now decide to take a different tact, not wanting to continue dealing with Stephanie this way, and deciding to Give, as Henri breaks off with a vow to kill Stephanie (Matthew decides he'd rather keep a die and go straight to that Conflict - because Stephanie has so many d10s against her now that he hopes she'll die anyway!).  Emile agrees he would prefer this, and while Jean-Luc will not kill Stephanie, the point is moot as Stephanie now is seen to be mortally wounded.  Henri, as he checks himself, realizes that he's not so bad after all (Matthew had a few d10s and even some d8s and more, yet his highest total was a 10 or 11!), and Emile also was banged up but basically okay, too (no medical follow-up).  Jean-Luc was in no real danger.  This is where as I mention early in the thread they agree to let Stephanie live or die at God's will, letting nature take its course; she dies, bleeding into the street as les Chiens bar those few faithful who even consider opposing them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147864">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Carl" title="Carl"><img alt="Carl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Carl">Carl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147864/#Comment_147864" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T23:54:03+00:00" title="June  3, 2008 11:54PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds awesome!

Gareth asked me to post this text:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Gareth</cite><br/>Thanks for the great game and your kind comments here, Wilson. I thought you paced the game very nicely and, as Matt said, Stephanie was an excellent, sympathetic antagonist. The tricolour eyes will live on in my head, and the exploding church was a stroke of genius!<br/><br/>This was my first time playing Dogs and I was very impressed by the way that the moral dilemas embedded in the town situation are enjoyable to explore and come across as real human situations, rather than feeling like a dry intellectual exercise in moral judgement. I was also surprised at how tactical the dice decisions can be, which I liked a lot. Similarly the importance of the interactions amongst the Chiens didn't really occur to me until we got down and played. The tension between the strongly held, and equally persuasive, moral positions of Henri-Phillipe and Jean-Luc was the real engine of our session and was very cool.<br/><br/>One thing I enjoyed very much about the alternative setting was how much juicy baggage it allows you to put into the character generation process. My feeling about the character I played, Emile, was that his rejected, royalist background really easily informed his decisions (and indecisions!) about what to do in the town. On the one hand he was desperate to cling to the affirmation of revolutionary status that being a "real" Chien provided, on the other hand crushing the decisions of the townsfolk to all be chiens seemed like the kind of thing the old aristocracy would do. I think Emile was looking for a nice group of royalist malcontents that he could let loose the guillotine on.  I'm glad he didn't get what he was looking for!<br/><br/>Gareth<br/></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zornwil" title="zornwil"><img alt="zornwil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zornwil">zornwil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148029/#Comment_148029" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-04T09:22:24+00:00" title="June  4, 2008  9:22AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Matthew, for posting that, and please pass on my thanks to all as well for a great game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_148275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jana" title="Jana"><img alt="Jana" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jana">Jana</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148275/#Comment_148275" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-04T23:41:28+00:00" title="June  4, 2008 11:41PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 4, 2008 11:58PM by Jana.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the great writeup guys, and a fun adventure.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just have a couple things to add. A couple tasty details really brought the town to life visually, for me. The snow falling as the Chiens rode into town, and the rats and slop bucket in the improvised Town Hall Basement jail (aka "dungeon", when the dogs got thrown in!!). And Emile, burning the fancy furniture to keep warm during his winter of initiation as an ex-aristocrat--nice.<br/>\n<br/>\nI loved the heated debate between Henri and Jean-Luc, and enjoyed watching the subtle shifts in Emile's cryptic stance. Then the exploding church caught Jean-Luc de la For\xeat completely off guard and forced him to own his loyalties. Oddly, he escaped the explosion unscathed. . .Demonic influence had swept in and filled him with doubt about his position on Stephanie as her behavior (and EYES!) got increasingly bizarre, he reached the point where he had to call in the town's demons of self-determination in a last-ditch effort to preserve his ideal of the villagers-as-their-own-dogs--&gt;fight demons with demons! <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the end, the physical threats (the angry mob/dungeon scene and the flying church shrapnel) to the dogs re-unified their efforts and resolved what arguments and posturing couldn't. <br/>\n<br/>\nGreat stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148276">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zornwil" title="zornwil"><img alt="zornwil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zornwil">zornwil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148276/#Comment_148276" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-04T23:54:33+00:00" title="June  4, 2008 11:54PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 4, 2008 11:55PM by zornwil.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks a lot for sharing the details and the feedback, especially in reminding me of some details, too.  <br/>\n<br/>\n(whoops, edited, I misread that for a moment!) <br/>\n<br/>\nYou guys really were awesome players, I can't say it enough!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_148277">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zornwil" title="zornwil"><img alt="zornwil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zornwil">zornwil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148277/#Comment_148277" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-04T23:56:54+00:00" title="June  4, 2008 11:56PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            PS - also corrected the spelling of your PC's name in the first post, Jana                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
