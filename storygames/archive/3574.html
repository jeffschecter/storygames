In between each escalation is a quick cut to a black screen with white lettering saying "Escalate", in ever-increasing font.  It would end with a cut to black again, saying "Dogs in the Vineyard" and some tagline.<br/><br/>I'm probably never going to get around to making it, nor the one for Don't Rest Your Head, Spirit of the Century, Truth &amp; Justice, or the other indie games I love so much.  But I keep having neat ideas for 20-30 second internet video spots.  While this isn't exactly what we're talking about it, it's in a similar "get their attention quickly and get them interested in learning more" space.</blockquote>\nSee, this sounds to me like an awesome thing to do some random time slot at GenCon.  Seriously: my stupid midrange digital camera can take video.  I can dump that file into my laptop.  iMovie is a fantastic editing program, and free.  The only problem being, I'm not going to GenCon.<br/><br/>But that's no reason that other folks couldn't do this.  Seriously: what do you need, a couple cheap-ass costumes that can double as cosplay for a day, an empty room and/or park area, and maybe a rolled-up backdrop if you got <em>really</em> energetic about it?  This is easily within reach for indiefolk, and would only really require three or four designers getting together and 'starring' in each other's videos.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_80548">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80548/#Comment_80548" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-11T04:34:45+00:00" title="July 11, 2007  4:34AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a wonderful idea, but it is absolutely not how I want to spend my Gen Con minutes!

Unless the thing is very gen-con centric i don't think that's really the venue for something like this. <br/><br/>i considered doing this for Sweet Agatha, but i don't know if it would really get any heads watching it. I own a metric ton of video editing equipment and cameras, but the ROI just doesn't feel like it's there for me. Maybe later down the road. If i had my own GenCon booth (i'm with the forge this year) i would set up a few LCDs running stuff like this, but aside from that are people going to really watch this stuff (that aren't already owners of the product?). Is fan service worth it?
