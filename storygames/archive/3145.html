It is spun off a few posts on story games and some folks that I chat with being pensive about trying new games.  Therefore I am going to try and fit story ideas into a D&amp;D game.  <br/><br/><b>Here are my project goals:</b><br/>1.\tRun D&amp;D 3.5 with as little drift/hack (change in the rules) as I can muster.  I suspect this will be more about ommission of rules than additions or changes.<br/>2.\tRun 4-6 session of the game for a mix of 6 players.  That means that the characters will level once or twice at most (my biggest beef with D&amp;D).<br/>3.\tRecord and post an Actual Play for The Reality Vault.<br/>4.\tUse miniatures and map tiles I delevoped some time ago (1\xc2\xbd" tiles).<br/>5.\tHave some good clean SG fun.<br/><br/><b>Here are the project obstacles as I see them:</b><br/>1.\tExpectation - How far can I push the envelope?  I am not going to break the Social Contract and be certain that everyone understands the goals.  Can I run D&amp;D "as is" and produce a role-playing experience I and the players are happy with?<br/>2.\tFeats and Spells - I don't want to prematurely limit the players choices.  One session will undoubtably be world and character creation.  As such I have to make certain that their spell and feat choices must have mechanical weight while not dropping out of the story.<br/>3.\tCombat - I find many games come to a crashing halt when combat comes around.  Even my favorite game, Burning Wheel, has a complex combat system that defies much of the wisdom of the rest of the game.  This is going to be the absolute greatest challenge.  How do I make it D&amp;D and limit combat to a level that allows me to continue to focus on the story?<br/>4.\tTime and Energy - I want to be able to approach the on the same commitment level as many of the games we play.  I like to know that when I come to the table I am prepared but not feel like "I did all this work for naught."  And I have to do it in a way that satisfies me and doesn't drain my enthusiasm for the game (meaning, there is as much player authoring as they can handle yet retain something of D&amp;D).<br/><br/><b>SO things I plan on implimenting and even changing from the outset:</b><br/>1.\tBeliefs &amp; Bangs - Everyone will start with creating three beliefs (core ideals linked to goals and actions - this idea is the central SG mechanic in Burning Wheel and has strong coorelations to TSoY's Keys and Heroes Banner, etc.).  Situations, scenes, conflicts and some roleplaying awards will be linked to them.  After everyone sets up their beliefs then I will have a group vote to establish each character's alignment.  <br/>2.\tRound robin style of narraration - Scene and stakes oriented play.  Come to the center of the conflict and play out those interactions (agressive scene framing and prompting - otherwise known as The Mountain Witch Trick).<br/>3.\tLet it ride - Each player is allowed to make one roll per scene to adjudicate stakes.  I suspect many rolls will be about assisting others which they will have to narrarate.<br/>4.\tDamage - Something needs to be done about rolling for damage.  The extra roll slows things down and takes the oomph out of a great roll.  As I see it I have three choices a) roll damage with each hit and intepret the results accordingly (least satisfying), b) rate damage based on weapon and how well you hit, or c) abstract damage narratively (most satisfying but most drift).<br/>5.\tGameMastery Item Cards - I find the imagry on the cards to be evocative and the way they are handled for stats to be handy.  I will develop some items ahead of time and players may spend gold and XP introducing their own items to the story.<br/><br/>Okay so first I need to clearly address each obstacle.  Then I need six players and a time slot.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_71810">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71810/#Comment_71810" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-25T09:03:39+00:00" title="May 25, 2007  9:03AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I may try to do a test of this tomorrow during my game day.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71823">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71823/#Comment_71823" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-25T10:08:53+00:00" title="May 25, 2007 10:08AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So combat.  I have been running around a few ideas:<br/>1.  My standard way to deal with D&amp;D (and most traditional task resolution systems) is that I have a standing rule (not open to my players) - mooks take 1 hit to go down and big bads take about three.  This is the most satisfying result for me in the story but the least satisfying for my exercise since it completely guts D&amp;D and makes character creation decisions almost pointless.<br/><br/>2. Retool the numbers a little.  One of my options was to just always assume max damage. But this was a little disatisfying in the story elements.  I and the players would just have to work extra hard at not falling into the trap of just number crunching and really get down to the descriptions.<br/><br/>3.  I am considering a Dogs like approach where I have them roll a number of dice for the conflict and everyone goes back and forth narrarating the effect of those dice.  <b>I think I like this the best.</b><br/><br/><i><b>example:</b> Everyone rolls a 3d20 and damage dice including any feat and spell dice.  If they can justify narratively and mechanically that they could bring in other skills then they can roll that number of d20s as well.  Then each player goes back and forth describing their actions and comparing them to the opponent's AC/DC.  </i><br/><br/>ooo, I dig this.  What do people think?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_71884">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71884/#Comment_71884" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-25T13:49:20+00:00" title="May 25, 2007  1:49PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I dunno, 3 sounds like a pretty big drift here, too. Including the fact that some feats will have to be retooled to work.<br/>\n<br/>\nPut another way, if you're willing to drift that far, why not just play Courtiers in the Courtyard? Or TSOY?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you really want to stick to D&amp;D;, then I think that your first option is sorta best. For one, I think it's pretty realistic. To make combat selections actually matter, instead of 1/3 HP for mooks/named characters, go with one quarter for mooks, and one half for named characters. Then their surrender at this point will represent them being hurt to a significant extent. And should speed things up just fine. Especially if you go somewhat medium to low level, where the resulting HP range is near to weapon range. Such that a crit can take down somebody in one roll, and otherwise two or three hits will do the job.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/talysman" title="talysman"><img alt="talysman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/talysman">talysman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71893/#Comment_71893" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-25T14:28:12+00:00" title="May 25, 2007  2:28PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I agree with Mike.</p>\n<p>No, wait, I don't. I'm even more extreme. I think if you don't want actual rules drift, but want a D&amp;D story game, you should focus on the area where D&amp;D doesn't have many (if any) rules: the scenario structure. D&amp;D has rules for resolving combat and skill use, gaining experience, and balancing challenges. Use as much detail in those rules as you wish, but don't add anything.</p>\n<p>What you want to add is something that drives stories. You could do this by adding things like kickers, pre-defined relationships, and beliefs, but consider this: Trollbabe is definitely a story game, but it doesn't have any of those. Notably, the game is about relationships, but you don't start play with relationships: you gain them. And there are no mechanical represations of beliefs at all. So where does the story come from?</p>\n<p>The trick is that you can drive story internally (making it about a character's internal struggles) or externally (making it about conflict inherent in the setting and trying the characters to that conflict.) Trollbabe does the latter. I would argue that D&amp;D would be great for that approach as well. Really, I think the alignment system is a generally underused tool for creating setting-wide conflict.</p>\n<p>Start out by getting players to make characters for a basic D&amp;D fantasy world. Ask them what their characters have just finished doing and where they are going next, but otherwise don't ask them to pre-create conflicts. Have them pick alignments, exactly as in normal D&amp;D. Maybe ask them what their alignment means to them and why they chose it.</p>\n<p>Then, look over the range of alignments they selected. You will probably have a mix of Law/Chaos, or at the very least a predominant extreme alignment and a few outliers who are neutral on the same axis (for example, predominantly Chaotic Good with a few neutral goods, chaotic neutrals, and true neutrals.) The trick to creating story without predetermining plot is to toss out situations that have conflicts between Law/Chaos or between the predominant alignment and the neutrals. You've got paladins and chaotic good elves? Let them stumble upon a Lawful Neutral lord imposing an ordered regime that keeps out a Chaotic Evil menace, but as a consequence, oppresses some Chaotic Good citizens as well. Don't choose the way to end the story, just make <em>them</em> choose what to do, or when to walk away.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_71926">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mule" title="Mule"><img alt="Mule" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mule">Mule</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71926/#Comment_71926" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-25T16:47:03+00:00" title="May 25, 2007  4:47PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you're looking to play D&amp;D with as little drift as possible, drifting the combat isn't where I'd start.

If you're going to muck with combat, start by making it harder--say, Party Level +2 or so-- so that the players really have to scramble.  This means that there's less combat, but it matters more.  <br/><br/>But yeah, if you really want to run D&amp;D, I wouldn't really make any big changes to the combat system: it's the heart of the game.  <br/><br/>What always tripped me up was figuring out how to create scenarios, or adventures, or what have you.  I think having something where you go all hippie ("Here's the wizard's tower.  Your gang opposes the wizard.  Tell me why, and some other goal of yours") is probably the best bet.<br/><br/>One technique might be to adapt the "Big X" from Sorcerer -- for each character, make a chart with four quadrants labeled Class, Alignment, Race, and Fantasy Stuff.  ("Race" for humans might include your standard medieval cultural thing.)  And the player jots down backstory related to this stuff in the quadrants, and if stuff overlaps, or is close to another quadrant, it should reflect it.  This gives you a bulls-eye for hitting what the character is all about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_75382">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Peterson" title="Chris Peterson"><img alt="Chris Peterson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cpeterso.com/html/img/merman-confounded.200x200.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Peterson">Chris Peterson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75382/#Comment_75382" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-13T10:53:06+00:00" title="June 13, 2007 10:53AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here is an old SG thread where I explored how to intuit your players' story interests from their character sheets:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1317" rel="nofollow">[D&amp;D] DM tips for Player Flags?</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_75407">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jzn" title="jzn"><img alt="jzn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jzn">jzn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75407/#Comment_75407" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-13T11:29:00+00:00" title="June 13, 2007 11:29AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 13, 2007 11:30AM by jzn.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You don't necessarily need to change the combat rules to facilitate your goals, nor do you need to apply a major overhaul just to shorten the combats.
