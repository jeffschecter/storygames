After searching I found that it was mentioned way back in Feb 2006 when a poster named "neelk" replied in a thread called  "So, What's the best system for supers?"<br/><br/><br/>Here's his reply...\n<blockquote><i>"<b>My Life with Batman</b>.<br/><br/>The PCs are the second-stringers superheroes of Gotham -- Robin, the Huntress, Catwoman, Spoiler, Azrael, Batgirl. Their lives fall into the shadow of the Batman and his endless crusade for vengeance, and their wills are dominated and broken by his overwhelming mastery. Is their any part of their lives which is their own?<br/><br/>Batman is the Master, of course. He's a Beast/Teacher. The Outsiders are Superman and the Justice League, and Batman is obsessed with proving his superiority over them.

We weren't superheroes, we were minions of the Joker. It was brilliantly done, and since we were being commanded to do bad things, it worked perfectly well with the system. We created the Joker (settled on him being a Brain/Feeder, feeding on Chaos to show Batman that he can live without rules, but what was great is that all the options could have worked) and our minions. Two critical components that seem to be noticable lacking from My Life With Batman.  Since we worked for an evil master, all the rest of the structure still worked. I'm not sure how it can work with Batman. Maybe if his commands always enforce your role as a sidekick, and you need love for the confidence to break free?  The general idea of Batman's sidekicks rising up against him seems odd, though, and you have to reframe all the stats. The actual play didn't go into how the mechanics were changed to make it about superhero sidekicks instead of broken monster minions, so I'm still not sure how that can work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine" title="kevperrine"><img alt="kevperrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine">kevperrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166716/#Comment_166716" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-02T21:49:54+00:00" title="September  2, 2008  9:49PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I replied to your comments on my ACTUAL PLAY thread,  I'd like those interested to reply with thoughts  and  doing it in one thread helps.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=7477&amp;page=1#Comment_166715" rel="nofollow">ACTUAL PLAY - My Life with The Batman thread</a><br/><br/>-kev-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
