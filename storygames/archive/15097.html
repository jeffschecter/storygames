I'm running Cold City right now, for a group of people who probably haven't played anything since 2nd edition AD&amp;D twenty years ago, and it's going fairly well. I've asked for their preferences for the next game, and as a group we're leaning towards playing something A Game of Thrones-y, but no one wants to play in the established setting. So, AGoT with the serial numbers filed off. I threw them a quick survey about what they want to see in their game, and their preferences are (in order):<br/><br/>1 Politics/Relationships/PVP<br/>2 System Simplicity<br/>3 Character Growth: Personality &amp; Motivation<br/>4 Player Narrative Control/Authorship<br/>5 Setting Exploration (West Marches-alike)<br/>6 Character Growth: Power<br/>7 Detailed, Tactical Combat<br/><br/>So you can see that D&amp;D might be the exact opposite of what they want. I had considered BWG for this, or maybe REIGN with Keys added on, but I think those might stray from their preferences (high preference for system simplicity and low preference for tactical combat). That leads me to Smallville, Houses of the Blooded or FATE. If your group gave you the above criteria, what system would you use? Why?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_343271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343271/#Comment_343271" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-19T12:11:45+00:00" title="September 19, 2011 12:11PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>In a Wicked Age...</i> could be a good fit, too, based on those preferences.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_343276">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343276/#Comment_343276" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-19T13:02:45+00:00" title="September 19, 2011  1:02PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man, Apocalypse World fits all those criteria snugly, but you'd have to do a bunch of work to make the appropriate playsets for the setting.<br/><br/>(Dungeon World is very tightly focused on low-level goofballs running treasure prospecting startups, which doesn't sound very Game of Thrones to me.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_343283">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343283/#Comment_343283" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-19T13:12:48+00:00" title="September 19, 2011  1:12PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>In a Wicked Age</b>, but the characters might not last long.

He's totally a PC and antagonist.)<br/><br/>This is why it would work well to play a Game of Thrones style setting.<br/><br/>Here's the thing, though. It's really really hard to make a tabletop game feel like the novels. Because you have so many different threads going on at a time. So only like 2 or 3 important people are usually at the same place at the same time. And sometimes just 1. The opening situation of the first book, where tons of important people have all travelled up to Winterfell is an intentional exception.<br/><br/>I think it would be much easier to go for an hour-long drama TV show with a tighter cast of important characters version, but using a similar style of heavy politics as the core. In fact, the Starz show Camelot might, despite it's many flaws, serve as a better model of what you can do with a small group of people playing a small central cast of main characters.<br/><br/>Another possibility would be to come up with some way to have each player be in charge of multiple characters. Or some similar way to ramp up that "cast of thousands" feel that the source novels have. I certainly wouldn't want to burden a GM with trying to portray such a huge cast of important characters without assistance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_343300">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343300/#Comment_343300" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-19T14:15:43+00:00" title="September 19, 2011  2:15PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 19, 2011 2:17PM by johnzo.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some more specific reactions about BW:<br/><br/><b>1 Politics/Relationships/PVP</b><br/><br/>The BW character creation process isn't hardwired to create PC/PC relationships.  The system has space for them in the BITs, though, but I think the players and GM need to consciously decide to use them for that purpose.<br/><br/>I'm currently playing a mission-style BW game.  To give that game some unity and inward focus, our GM required that one of our Beliefs be targeted on another member of the party.  This has really spiced our play a lot and I think it's a best practice for relationshop-driven BW games.<br/><br/><b>2 System Simplicity</b><br/><br/>Ook.  While it's true that you can prune subsystems to make BW play quite simply, note that BW has substantial non-optional complexity in its character creation system, and really rewards system mastery during character creation.  To design exactly the character you like, you will have to dogear the hell out of the Character Burner.  <br/><br/>I know a number of players who have been frustrated by the work necessary to perfectly execute their character concepts.  And even though I'm not one of those kinds of players, I had to play a few sessions before I really knew my character's capabilities.  If you're going to run BW for your gang, you should take it easy on them in the early going and let them feel their way into the system.<br/><br/><b>3 Character Growth: Personality &amp; Motivation</b><br/><br/>BW is really super excellent at this, with clear processes for modifying BITs.  Some of those processes involve the group reviewing the character, and awarding or subtracting BITs.  I really enjoy this group process because it's a nice prompt for retrospection and celebration of the game, and gets everyone at the table involved in the character's growth and evolution -- traditionally a solo activity.  Players who demand more autonomy over their characters may not like this, of course!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_343303">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus" title="Mathalus"><img alt="Mathalus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dramaclubshakespearegame.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/32-bear.jpg?w=32&amp;h=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus">Mathalus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343303/#Comment_343303" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-19T14:28:41+00:00" title="September 19, 2011  2:28PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 19, 2011 2:29PM by Mathalus.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnzo</cite><br/><b>2 System Simplicity</b><br/><br/>Ook.

Just like with Burning Wheel, you can do relationship-driven stuff with PTA if you choose your Issues right (1).  Plus, PTA is dead simple to play (2), the growth of the characters is directly driven by the Story Arc (3), and cast members can have huge narrative impact via the conflict outcome narration rules (4).  <br/><br/>It doesn't do 5-7 at all, but that shopping list <i>is</i> priority ordered...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_343325">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343325/#Comment_343325" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-19T16:37:38+00:00" title="September 19, 2011  4:37PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fair enough!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_343328">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343328/#Comment_343328" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-19T17:28:37+00:00" title="September 19, 2011  5:28PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 20, 2011 9:41AM by mease19.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been working on A Game of Thrones hack of Lady Blackbird.  It starts something like this:<br/><br/><b>The Leaves are Turning</b><br/><br/>The leaves are turning in Westros, winter is coming.  With it, a new power on the throne.  A young pretender from House ________ has held the iron throne for but a fortnight and already it has been too long.  The wounds of the long summer are still fresh in the minds of many and the strongest of the great houses has already levied its bannermen.<br/><br/>For three days and three sleepless nights you\u2019ve huddled here, shoulder to shoulder, on the narrow ledge of your sky cell high in the Eyrie.  The charges against you are serious indeed.  <br/><br/>However, in just three days time a Braavos-bound ship, the Blackbird,  leaves from Heart's Home.  Unbeknownst to those in the Vale, it carries with it the late king\u2019s oldest child.  If only they knew what you know now, things might be different.  <br/><br/>Even now, an emissary from the Night's Watch has arrived at the gates below and you know what his offer will be - take the black or quickly grow wings.  When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. There is no middle ground.<br/><i><br/>Will you take the black or is there another way?<br/><br/>Can what you know keep you alive or will it lay you low?<br/><br/>One fortnight hence, who will sit atop the throne?</i><br/><br/>Go. Play. And find out.<br/><br/>-----------<br/>I'm thinking one fun part is first you choose the house that currently holds the throne, then each character chooses a house... and go.  Also, seeing that there is actually a ship called The Blackbird in A Dance with Dragons seemed like a sign from on high.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_343329">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343329/#Comment_343329" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-19T17:50:36+00:00" title="September 19, 2011  5:50PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hang on, people...<br/><br/>This bit:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: todd</cite>6 Character Growth: Power<br/>7 Detailed, Tactical Combat</blockquote>\nDoes it mean "these are the things we really do not like or want", or does it mean, "these are our sixth and seventh top priorities in play"?<br/><br/>There's a world of difference there.<br/><br/>Is "detailed combat" a "least desirable", or is it just the least important of the most important?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_343378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/todd" title="todd"><img alt="todd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/todd">todd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343378/#Comment_343378" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-20T09:36:13+00:00" title="September 20, 2011  9:36AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, very happy with all of the discussion, thanks. I take the suggestions of AW and IaWA very seriously, but I don't think they'll work for me. I've never had the chance to play/run either of them, and I'd really rather run them straight before I did any hacking to them. I'm hoping to steer the group towards AW for next summer's game. I don't have PTA, so that makes judging it difficult.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite><br/>Does it mean "these are the things we really do not like or want", or does it mean, "these are our sixth and seventh top priorities in play"?<br/><br/>There's a world of difference there.<br/><br/>Is "detailed combat" a "least desirable", or is it just the least important of the most important?</blockquote>\nPaul, you're absolutely right, that's something I should have made more clear in the initial post. Those seven options are the options I gave them, which they then ordered. So tactical combat is seven-out-of-seven rather than seven out of infinity. I presented them with the choice of "detailed, tactical combat" specifically with systems like BW, Reign and even PDQ# in mind.<br/><br/>That said, most of the player's expectations are really being formed by some 20 year old experience with AD&amp;D, current experience with the D&amp;D board games and our current (fairly successful) Cold City game. I'm willing to allow them to be surprised by systems that actually work, and they've put a more than fair amount of trust in me to provide something fun. So I have leeway. If BW is the right thing (and I'm largely torn between that and Smallville at the moment), I'm willing to run it for them, even if it doesn't give them exactly what they *think* they want.<br/><br/>As a corollary, can some people familiar with both BW and Smallville (I have little direct experience) give me some idea of what sort of differences in play experience the two systems might drive? What would come to the fore in a BW game that wouldn't be as prevalent in Smallville, and vice versa?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_343418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343418/#Comment_343418" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-20T15:40:31+00:00" title="September 20, 2011  3:40PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Shadow of Yesterday / Solar System!

I get confused or bored and can't get through it. So I don't know how it plays, because I couldn't get through enough of the text to actually try playing it.<br/><br/>My experience with Smallville: I read through it and found it exciting and compelling. And I read through Leverage as well and found that compelling also. So I worked up a hack that drew on both of them and tried playing it. But I didn't do the relationship map and lifepath stuff from Smallville. And I think that hurt the game and left it wanting. So we ended up system swapping over to a Savage Worlds hack that has been working nicely.<br/><br/>However, I get the sense that if you play it much more closely to how it was written, that it'll work much much better. Because the lifepaths and relationship map stuff is really core to the play. Of course, you'll have to create some custom lifepaths for ASOIAF, but there has been some work done at Somethingville that should help a lot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_343427">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343427/#Comment_343427" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-20T18:04:33+00:00" title="September 20, 2011  6:04PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            BW will give you belief driven gameplay. Fights both physical and social that take up a lot of space, though you can do unimportant ones rather quickly.  I've played it PvP and it works well. However, there is very little braking mechanism for character death. If two PCs decide to duel to the death, one will very likely leave on their shield (I speak from experience here!). Pragmatically, setting up new lifepaths that fit Game of Thrones might be a huge undertaking. I'm not sure how much of the Man lifepaths are useable, but there are certainly holes to fill to fit the setting of Westeros.<br/><br/>Smallville will give you relationship driven gameplay. Conflicts will focus more on roleplaying and what the characters want, but they rarely get what they want. It's very good at keeping characters (players too) at odds with a constant flux of unresolved issues. Characters will change and grow quite often, trending upwards, but with a lot of detours. PC death will never happen without buy-in from the PC. You could make some simple tweaks to change this to better fit the feel of GoT, but I'd still favor player buy-in for writing their characters out of the story. As a reader, constantly feeling that a character is in peril can drive you to find out what happens next. As a player, it can drive you to only making the safest choices to gain the most mechanical power and become a burden and hindrance to telling an interesting story. Pragmatically, it would be pretty easy to adjust the lifepaths to better fit the setting. You probably want to remove access to abilities and maybe gear. Though you could get away with keeping both, just tone down the setting effects to be less flashy than the superpowers they model, and go more for the mechanical feel they add (e.g. Invulnerable becomes Tough as a Khal, Super Speed could become Always Nearby or Quick Foot).  You could consider hacking in a system for mass combat, perhaps taken from Reign, to allow for more unpredictable and decisive outcomes from army battles, and make them less about the values and relationships of the characters calling the shots.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_343430">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343430/#Comment_343430" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-20T18:21:35+00:00" title="September 20, 2011  6:21PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            BW also demands a group of players who are interested in mastering a white-dwarf-dense system.<br/><br/>That said there are plenty of ways to get folks on track and get started in play.  You could burn up some vague Ice and Fire inspired archetypes and allow the players to flesh them out with spending of resource points and beliefs, Instincts and Traits. <br/><br/>Good luck.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_343447">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil" title="Neil"><img alt="Neil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil">Neil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343447/#Comment_343447" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-21T01:36:34+00:00" title="September 21, 2011  1:36AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 21, 2011 1:38AM by Neil.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If they liked Cold City, how about Hot War? Mechanically, it's much like Cold City except that it uses Relationships mechanically instead of Trust, and tweaks the Hidden Agenda bits. <br/><br/>Smallville works well for soap-opera type games (I'm planning a version of HBO's Rome series using it), but it doesn't have a high death rate. You can't die in Smallville (unless you want your PC to die) and you can't even suffer permanent mechanical damage. That might change the tone of the game a bit from the Game of Thrones feeling.<br/><br/>Personally, I'd avoid Burning Wheel unless people are committed to playing it for six months plus, probably with spending a few sessions first on an extended one-off to see how the system works, and in particular how all the spot rules in the Traits affect things in the system. It requires a large investment from the players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
