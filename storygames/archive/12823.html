I'm comfortable with either 1) no combat scenes at all, 2) D&amp;D4 or similar super-structured boardgame combat, 3) I roll some dice, players roll some dice, wing it according to some house rules.<br/><br/>But I don't want to default to any of these modes.

Who drew the gun and why?<br/><br/>If Keeler the PC gunlugger drew the gun to make Barnum back the hell off, and is prepared to shoot him, then he's going aggro.<br/><br/>If Tum Tum (an NPC) drew, then maybe he's just going to shoot someone and the MC could make a move like "Inflict harm as established" ('Tum Tum shoots you, take 2 harm.') or "Separate them" ('Tum Tum starts spraying bullets and you all have to take cover, so Keeler you're behind the car and Impala is snugged down in the footwell').<br/><br/>Concisely, if a PC does a move (Go Aggro, Seize By Force, maybe Act Under Fire), then they do it and roll.<br/><br/>If it's the MC making a move, you need to go back to the MC and Threat move lists, and pick one from there. It's usually best to pick something that gives the PCs a chance to react. I wouldn't often just Inflict Harm - more likely, I'd announce future badness 'Tum Tum's gonna shoot you if you don't stop him somehow' and let the PC pick their move to react.<br/><br/>It's all moves, and who gets a turn is based on what is happening in the game. As MC, note that it's very specific about when you are allowed to make a move. Most importantly, when someone misses a roll or when the players look at you expecting you to say something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288632/#Comment_288632" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-25T01:50:11+00:00" title="August 25, 2010  1:50AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Sands</cite>As MC, note that it's very specific about when you are allowed to make a move.

Establish that what they're doing is a move and roll. If they miss or look at you, make your move. If you want some "round structure", Vincent suggest you use a countdown clock. Each tick is someone does a thing. Player does a thing, MC does a thing, Player does a thing, MC does a thing...when you hit midnight resolve the whole battle or launch a new conflict.<br/><br/>The most important thing to do is establish and pay attention to the moment-to-moment fiction. Someone draws a gun. Cool. Who is it, where is he, why is he drawing the gun, what is he doing with it.<br/><br/>When it's "your turn" as a MC, you can just <i>inflict harm as established</i> ("TumTum fires his shotgun at your face.") but that's kinda boring. You can also use the other moves (frex "<i>separate them</i>" as Mike suggests) or whatever. A cool way to do it is to simply split-second <i>announce future badness</i>, with future badness being "you get filled with lead". "Rolfball rises the aim of his assault riffle at your chest and presses the trigger, what do you do?" Whatever they do, it's probably "acting under fire", let them roll and if they miss, bring down harm as established, otherwise let moves snowball.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288668">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288668/#Comment_288668" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-25T07:18:49+00:00" title="August 25, 2010  7:18AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 25, 2010 7:19AM by jenskot.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Edit: oops... wrong thread!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288696">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson" title="Matt Wilson"><img alt="Matt Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dog-eared-designs.com/img/goaticon2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson">Matt Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288696/#Comment_288696" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-25T08:39:24+00:00" title="August 25, 2010  8:39AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Since you're looking at your NPCs through crosshairs, you want to dish them up for the characters to kill.

I don't know that I'd describe that axe wielding motherfucker as some kind of stock description. Fine tune it to make things the most not-boring.<br/><br/>If say it's the skinner, and he's unarmored and already at 9:00, the imminent axe death probably isn't the best way to make the character's life not boring. So I'd probably phrase the future badness as something like "you see a big fucker with an axe come around the corner, and he spots you. What do you do?" Now I have more wiggle room to do something like "you get captured" if the roll goes badly. <br/><br/>But if it's the gunlugger, with 2-armor, that axe is going to do 1-harm at the most if it's really huge and scary. So yeah, bring it on! "The axe slams into your chestplate. You have 2-armor? Okay, so it doesn't cut you open, but damn the impact is going to leave one hell of a bruise later.

What do you do? (announcing future badness)<br/><br/>Boo: Oh I get off the track and see who comes in.<br/><br/>MC: So the train rolls in and the windows are all reinforced with bolted on sheet metal. Staring out from the subway doors you see one guy in a ski mask and another guy with a bandana wrapped around his mouth. They're shirtless and covered in tattoos and the one guy has a chain and the other has a hatchet. (put them in a spot)<br/><br/>Boo: Oh fuck! I scramble up the stairs and get the hell out of there.<br/><br/>MC: Okay, you're acting under fire where the fire is them coming screaming and howling out of the subway train after your ass.<br/><br/>(Boo rolls a soft hit. I offer him a hard choice.)<br/><br/>MC: Okay, shit, there is a bunch of them and they are after you and the only thing you could do to get them off your tail is to run them to a nearby settlement and get them tied up with security there or maybe they'll get distracted by other targets. The nearest place is Hightower, you could head there.<br/><br/>Boo: Ugh, no. Okay, I fall onto my back on the stairs and I hide a knife behind my arm. I am stabbing the first asshole on top of me and I am trying to scare them off.<br/><br/>MC: Okay, that's going aggro. Roll.<br/><br/>(Boo rolls and gets a hard hit. I can either have them get scared off or suck it up. I'm not done with Boo yet so they suck it up.)<br/><br/>MC: Okay so the first guy on top of you is the one in the ski mask. You slash up at him and get him right in the throat and he falls backwards, but the guys behind him just grab him and hurl him down the stairs behind them, and he's spraying blood and gurgling. The guy in the bandana slams his body on top of yours and he's swinging this hatchet at your head. The first swing misses and clangs the stairs. What are you doing, by the way?<br/><br/>Boo: Fuck.

I just scream bloody murder and hope someone shows up to save me.<br/><br/>MC: Okay, act under fire again where the fire is a hatchet aimed at your head.<br/><br/>(Boo rolls a soft hit. I offer a hard bargain.)<br/><br/>MC: Okay, so you can scream but it's going to make your grip on this guy's arm go slack and you're going to get a solid hit landed on you from that hatchet, is that cool?<br/><br/>Boo: Yeah.<br/><br/>MC: Okay, so the hatchet slams into your upper arm and you're like a doctor, you can tell it's caught on the bone. Take 2-harm.<br/><br/>Boo: Okay, so I take 1 because I'm wearing armor.<br/><br/>MC: Yeah. And Burroughs, you're out in the town looking for Toker, right?<br/><br/>Burroughs: Sure am.<br/><br/>MC: Okay, you hear this bloodcurdling scream coming from Elm Street Station.

If he had gone for the settlement that would have been the scene. He would have scurried away and the raiders would have gotten tied up in Hightower.<br/><br/>Also, Apocalypse World is not very nice to individuals taking on groups which is why his Go Aggro did damage to them, but not a lot.<br/><br/>And, he was awesome when he saved the little girl's life earlier in the evening. He was also awesome when she went into convulsions due to the medicine he gave her and his mother attacked him because she thought he was killing her, and he just hugged her and she started crying and calmed down.<br/><br/>Failure in this case probably would have had him getting dragged away by the subway raiders into the darkness for more bad things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288758/#Comment_288758" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-25T10:57:55+00:00" title="August 25, 2010 10:57AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason, I don't quite see the not-awesome there.

Maybe I just have a different take on the fiction, but I imagine that any NPCs that had been standing beside the PC would just be dead. Not even crawling away and maybe getting help: dead.<br/><br/>I have a question that's relevant to AW, but I'm particularly interested in for how it transfers over to Dungeon World:<br/><br/>Let's say the subway train rolls in and the guys rush out, but the player is at a loss for what to do, so they read the sitch (hoping to figure out an exit). The PC is looking around desperately and the guys swarm around. They may the roll, let's say 10+, and get to ask their questions. Does the PC take the harm implied from the fact that they're looking for a way out while an armed mob rushes them?<br/><br/>On the one hand, it seems like reading a sitch while there's armed people around you should open you up to harm.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the PC succeeded.

I can either have them get scared off or suck it up. I'm not done with Boo yet so they suck it up.)</blockquote>\nI'm assuming this means that Bret is being a good MC and interpreting the shock on Boo's player's face as being a mixture of excitement and horror, which both sound like excellent ingredients in an AW game. This is a situation that holds interest, so let's run with it for a while. At any time, Bret can offer a bargain resulting in the fight being over (in fact, he did that once before the fight, and the player opted not to - flagging that he was up for a challenge).<br/><br/>"Demoralizing" also sounds like a good ingredient for AW, actually, as long as it's on a character level. If this fight resulted in serious consequences for the Boo+Burroughs team, I wouldn't want to be Mr. Hatchet-wielder when they carry out their revenge.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288762">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288762/#Comment_288762" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-25T11:02:08+00:00" title="August 25, 2010 11:02AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 25, 2010 11:02AM by Bret_Gillan.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sage, I wouldn't inflict harm on a guy reading the situation unless imminent harm was already established (guy pinned down on staircase with hatchet-wielding psycho swinging at him) and he blew the roll.

As a player, how can I use Acting Under Fire actively (rather than reactively) to accomplish my goals?<br/><br/> In the example you used, it's obvious that someone good at Hard (a Gunlugger, for example) could stand up to those guys and have a cinematically awesome, guns-blazing scene.  We get that easily because we're gamers and there are strong models for that sort of play.  But how does a Driver- standing here on the tracks without his car, for example- get to be awesome?  How might a player use Reading the Sitch or Acting Under Fire to create a really fun victory out of this situation?<br/><br/>If the answer is that not everyone gets to be awesome in this situation, or that the Driver probably should stick to his car, that seems too limited.  Fights scenes are the go-to choice for any action-oriented game, and I can see why a player might look at their sheet and wonder how they can make their tools work for them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288787">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288787/#Comment_288787" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-25T11:39:07+00:00" title="August 25, 2010 11:39AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 25, 2010 11:39AM by Bret_Gillan.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Steve, acting under fire might have let him slip past the gang and hijack their train car and escape from them, as one example.

I guess I want success to be meaningful, and it seems like it isn't on a 7-9, which is by far the most likely outcome.</blockquote>\nThe missing ingredients here are: <i>the basic situation constrains the possibilities</i> and <i>successful at what</i>.<br/><br/>The choices the player made are what gave those results -- everyone is focusing way too much on the die rolls, even ignoring the fact that 7-9 is only a partial success. If Boo had decided to act just spend all his actions fucking up the opponents, it probably would have been over in his favour by the end of those rolls. Or if Boo had decided to manipulate them, or whatever. Act Under Fire, as a move, tends to have the most mixed 7-9 results, because it allows a lot of leeway beyond the very basic success. The only 10+ Boo rolled resulted in his straight-up killing a guy.<br/><br/>And then there's the situation the MC has set up -- not one that lends itself to immediate, easy resolution. One PC vs. a gang of armed crazies is not something you can usually deal with in a single roll, unless you are a Gunlugger or a Hocus or have your own gang. Rolls in AW do not overrule the fiction -- this is not some kind of conflict-resolution-leads-to-complete-narrative-authority sort of game. Rolls add very specific details, and the fiction continues with its own momentum (slightly modified.) You can't make a roll and introduce new characters -- for example, if Boo yells for help and nobody is around, it doesn't matter what Boo rolls (though the MC should probably warn the player that there's nobody around before they decide to take that action, in that case.) The dice don't let you slam a round peg into a square hole, just because you're a PC. To do it, you have to do it; and for it to help, it has to help.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288794">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288794/#Comment_288794" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-25T11:49:15+00:00" title="August 25, 2010 11:49AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 25, 2010 11:49AM by Per_Fischer.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Cross-posted with many)<br/><br/>I'll be playing this very soon as well, and am listening with great interest.<br/><br/>I seems to me that Matt didn't say Bret was neither "out of bounds" or breaking a rule, merely being harsh as the MC, yes?<br/><br/>Per                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288795">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson" title="Matt Wilson"><img alt="Matt Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dog-eared-designs.com/img/goaticon2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson">Matt Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288795/#Comment_288795" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-25T11:53:21+00:00" title="August 25, 2010 11:53AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Per Fischer</cite>(Cross-posted with many)<br/><br/>I'll be playing this very soon as well, and am listening with great interest.<br/><br/>I seems to me that Matt didn't say Bret was neither "out of bounds" or breaking a rule, merely being harsh as the MC, yes?<br/><br/>Per</blockquote>\nOffline I talked to Bret about it a little, too, and here's the bottom line:<br/><br/>I don't care what your tone is, don't wander off by yourself in the ruins if you're the medic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch" title="Will_Hindmarch"><img alt="Will_Hindmarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.wordstudio.net/coffee_ring-32px.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch">Will_Hindmarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288819/#Comment_288819" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-25T12:32:30+00:00" title="August 25, 2010 12:32PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a fascinating and well-timed discussion, as it relieves some of the issues I have with the game, from my read-through of the book... and exacerbates others.

A sketch map can make things a whole lot more focused and interesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288821">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288821/#Comment_288821" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-25T12:37:17+00:00" title="August 25, 2010 12:37PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Will Hindmarch</cite>This is a fascinating and well-timed discussion, as it relieves some of the issues I have with the game, from my read-through of the book... and exacerbates others.

I bet you're not the only person with those issues, and it'll probably lead to more GM shop talk and good stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289073">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marc_Majcher" title="Marc_Majcher"><img alt="Marc_Majcher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marc_Majcher">Marc_Majcher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289073/#Comment_289073" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-26T22:55:19+00:00" title="August 26, 2010 10:55PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 26, 2010 10:55PM by Marc_Majcher.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Boo wasn't awesome, even though he never missed a roll. Is this just a thing or am I missing something?<br/><br/>How would this have gone differently if Boo had missed every roll?</blockquote>\nI played a game of AW recently in which I started off as a bad-ass Battlebabe - one of the very first things I did was coolly walk up to a gang of fairly well-armed mooks and unloaded my auto-pistol into them. I rolled very poorly on the move, and the follow-up harm move, and wound up getting my gun arm shattered by bullets, falling off a roof, and getting completely sucked under and stuck in the foetid swamp mud that surrounded us. I opened my brain up, failed some more rolls, and continued to take harm while the rest of the players also continued to roll poorly and get variously fucked up while trying to pull my sorry ass out, before getting attacked and routed by the monstrous alligator that eventually carried my broken body back down, deep into the swamp.<br/><br/>So many awesome things happened, both to my character and others, not despite of the blown rolls, but because of them. To me, it feels like that when you get a hard hit, you affect the world; when you miss hard, the world affects you; and if you luck out and get a partial success, it goes both ways. It might just be my dramatic style, but if my super-cool gun lady gets totally Aeon Fluxxed right out of the gate - partially because of the blowback from the latest in a long line of atrocities that she's committed in the past - and totally changes her worldview and objectives as a result, that counts as awesome to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
