We basically decided to skip to the "endgame" that we'd have needed another several hundred XP and who knows how many sessions to even approach using Storyteller's methods.<br/><br/><i>-How did you choose the new system?</i><br/>We made a couple stabs at house-ruling fixes or outright replacements for various bits of CtL, considered restatting everyone as Nobilis characters (CtL and Nobilis have surprisingly compatible cosmologies) and at one point even toyed with the idea of converting it on the fly to Reign/ORE (mainly because it was another d10 die pool system, which suggested we might not even need to rewrite the character sheets, just change the die mechanic, but the Company rules seemed very appealing for the large-scale actions some of us were interested in), but none of those solutions appealed to the group as a whole.  After a lot of discussion we decided our more pressing problem was the screen time and overall power level-- we had too many characters with too divergent goals to play well together, many of which were moving on different time scales (while one character wanted to go buy a house to enchant and fortify as a bulwark against the fae, another wanted to stay focused on a party that was going on at a local freehold and schmooze and network with every NPC, so either the homebody gets sidelined, the party animal gets fast-forwarded, or the timeline gets hideously fractured), and in almost every case PCs had motivations involving direct conflict with or manipulation of True Fae, Freehold royalty, and mundane government officials and it would have taken a very long time to amass enough personal power and influence to act on that scale.  <br/><br/>Microscope seemed the obvious choice to get a lot of story done in a short amount of time. 2/3rds of the group were familiar with and loved it, and the remainder were willing to give it a shot.  <br/><br/><i>-Did you keep the same characters, or did you just use the same setting/world?</i><br/>Same characters, but given the sort of character-agnostic bent of Microscope that question doesn't mean terribly much.  We agreed not to have someone's PC show up in a scene without that player playing them, but in many scenes we had 1-2 of the PCs while the others played supporting cast or antagonists as need be.<br/><br/><i>-How did you handle the conversion of specific mechanics, gear, powers, abilities, traits, etc. to the new system?</i><br/>Again, that sort of stuff is all basically background color to Microscope, which was very freeing because we got to play around with the very enticing theme and ideas of the various Contracts, Pledges, and Kiths/Seemings without the unsatisfying mechanics associated with them.<br/><br/><i>-How did it affect the narrative development of your game?</i><br/>Tremendously, which was the desired goal.  With the freedom to establish facts by fiat or ask provocative questions, we reached the narrative endgame immediately, and had the ability to zoom in on and revisit specific moments of character development or just striking setpieces.  It felt a lot like skipping right to the "reminisce about the good parts of the campaign" phase.<br/><br/><i>-Did characters change substantively "in the fiction"?</i><br/>Not so much in the immediate transition, but given the freedom to immediately skip to our projected personal endgames (and we went all Gotterdammerung, every PC had a confirmed death, and I think we played out death scenes for all but one character) there were occasional jars between the characters we'd seen in the campaign to date and the eventual people they became.  One character was a flighty, somewhat pretentious artist who killed his Fetch and absorbed its mind as a sort of shadow self, and his player pretty much immediately established that he went on stealing souls and amassing power until he finally sold all his souls to become a True Fae himself.<br/><br/><i>-How smooth or rocky was the transition?</i><br/>Very smooth.  The new players acclimated quickly, and we were all very hungry to start playing with the really cosmic parts of the setting like the True Fae and Hedge that were basically very high-level content.<br/><br/><i>-Was it a collaborative process with your players, or did the work fall mostly on the shoulders of the GM/host?</i><br/>Microscope is GMless, so it was a full group collaboration.  The former GM didn't have a pet character of his own, but got to work in and/or play most of the NPCs he'd already prepped.<br/><br/><i>-Did you find it rewarding, or too much trouble?</i><br/>Super rewarding, to the point where I kind of feel "done" with CtL; I got to play around with all the stuff I found most interesting about the premise and setting.  We actually documented our timeline in a video with commentary from the group, we should put that up on Youtube or something.<br/><br/><i>-How far along was the original game when you made the switch?</i><br/>In that AP link our GM says we were 20 sessions in, which seems unbelievably high, but I guess Last Year Us would remember better.  In hindsight I think it says volumes about how grouchy we'd gotten about the whole experience that we were willing to just try and put it to bed in 2-3 final sessions and then speak of it no more.<br/><br/><i>All three examples so far involve going from a complex game to a more streamlined system. Has anyone done the opposite?</i> <br/>Not yet, and another member of my group is considering using The Quiet Year as an epilogue for an Ars Magica game that's ending due to the primary GM moving away (a game that actually began as the replacement for that Changeling game!).  I'm a lot more likely to play rules-light than -heavy these days, so I don't see myself saying "this game could really use more detailed rules to make the campaign sing", but you never know.  I have long had a dream of using Microscope to cook up a campaign setting and then use some other game to play in it, so I guess that'd qualify...<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403010/#Comment_403010" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-08T08:18:49+00:00" title="January  8, 2013  8:18AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            -What systems were they?<br/>palladium's robotech to d20, Anima to 7 different hacks of my own sampled from 20 different indy games.

One other player was excited to try something less "mainstream" (although 'Storming the Wizard's Tower' is pretty traditional), one player was a little bit against the idea, and 2-3 more didn't give a flip.<br/><br/><b>Did you keep the same characters, or did you just use the same setting/world?</b><br/>Same characters, for the most part. Converting was fun for those of us who cared.<br/><br/><b>How did you handle the conversion of specific mechanics, gear, powers, abilities, traits, etc. to the new system?</b><br/>I wrote up the archetypes (or whatever they're called in 'Storming the Wizard's Tower') based on the existing characters, rather than their D&amp;D classes, which was fun for me, and went over well with everyone.<br/><br/><b>How did it affect the narrative development of your game?</b><br/>I think it left more time per session open for exploring the colaboratively-created setting, which a couple of the players were pretty into. (The game had a wiki, where 2-3 people composed big chunks of setting and backstory on a regular basis).<br/><br/><b>Did characters change substantively "in the fiction"?</b><br/>I don't think so? Can't recall.<br/><br/><b>How smooth or rocky was the transition?</b><br/>Pretty smooth. Learning the new rules for fighting and doing stuff was the bulk of the learning process.<br/><br/><b>Was it a collaborative process with your players, or did the work fall mostly on the shoulders of the GM/host?</b><br/>Almost entirely on the GM. But I was instigating the change and excited about the new rules, so I didn't mind.<br/><br/><b>Did you find it rewarding, or too much trouble?</b><br/>Rewarding, I guess, but the game ended shortly after the change (1 or 2 sessions), so perhaps not worth the trouble.<br/><br/><b>How far along was the original game when you made the switch?</b><br/>Just a couple sessions, but it was the second game to take place in that setting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403047/#Comment_403047" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-08T13:19:39+00:00" title="January  8, 2013  1:19PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know Storming the Wizard's Tower, but I love the idea of writing up character-specific playbooks (or whatever), rather than converting based on class.

We wrote up custom playbooks for two of the simplest characters (a fighter/thief and a monk) and advanced them enough to flesh them out accurately. Then I started asking them questions to frame the scene, telling them not to worry about continuity with our previous sessions (years ago now). Together we painted a Middle Eastern setting not unlike something from Assassin's Creed, to which I added some dreamlike elements. I had very little idea where things might go, and did a lot of following the fiction, which worked great. My friends struggled a little to let go of old ways, but really got the flow of DW by the end, which was a climactic fight with a powerful rakshasa that tied into our last session's story. They had a great time, and I don't think we'll be waiting so long for our next session.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403665">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403665/#Comment_403665" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-14T11:22:56+00:00" title="January 14, 2013 11:22AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 14, 2013 11:24AM by Steve_Segedy.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, thanks. I'll make it official: <br/><br/><b>What systems were they?</b><br/><br/>the old system was very custom, house-ruled version of D&amp;D, starting with 1st edition and adding elements of 2nd and 3rd as they suited us. By the end I was adding in story game-like elements as well. <br/><br/><b>Why did you decide to switch?</b><br/><br/>We found ourselves playing less and less frequently as we've gotten older, in part because it was hard to find time for the preparation D&amp;D requires and the long hours we needed to play a session. I was doing all the heavy lifting and just didn't have time for it anymore. We all wanted to play, but it just never happened.<br/><br/><b>How did you choose the new system?</b><br/><br/>With Dungeon World, the DM barely lifts a die by comparison. Prep is easier, running the game means leaning heavily on the players' ideas and the fiction, making it very simple to be flexible. In many ways, it's much like the house rules I'd been adding to D&amp;D for years, without all the rules infrastructure standing in my way. <br/><br/><b>Did you keep the same characters, or did you just use the same setting/world?</b><br/><br/>We wrote custom DW playbooks for the individual characters. I told the players not to rely on the assumptions of the old, but to use the best ideas to establish the new game. <br/><br/><b>How did you handle the conversion of specific mechanics, gear, powers, abilities, traits, etc. to the new system?</b><br/><br/>In some cases we dropped abilities or items that were no longer necessary- a +1 dagger isn't very interesting by itself, and is effectively the same as a normal dagger in DW. For those things that were cool and fun, we wrote appropriate moves or descriptions to fit them. (there are some balance issues still to work out).<br/><br/><b>How did it affect the narrative development of your game?</b><br/><br/>We'll see! It's letting us move forward, which is a great start.<br/><br/><b>Did characters change substantively "in the fiction"?</b><br/><br/>One player took the opportunity to state that his character is (and always has been) a woman, partly because he felt like the party needed some diversity. I think other characters will change just because we're writing our own custom moves for them.<br/><br/><b>How smooth or rocky was the transition?</b><br/><br/>We hadn't played in a while, so it took some warming up. By the end of the session they were clearly ready for more.<br/><br/><b>Was it a collaborative process with your players, or did the work fall mostly on the shoulders of the GM/host?</b><br/><br/>Collaborative, though I crafted the move descriptions after asking them "what are the ten most interesting aspects of your character?"<br/><br/><b>Did you find it rewarding, or too much trouble?</b><br/><br/>I'm pretty excited about it so far. <br/><br/><b>How far along was the original game when you made the switch?</b><br/><br/>It's been going on for a long time. We used to play every week for years, and then it slowly dwindled down to once every few years. I think the characters were 10th level or so, following a really slow advancement path.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403667/#Comment_403667" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-14T11:44:13+00:00" title="January 14, 2013 11:44AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 14, 2013 11:44AM by Felan.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>...

Less tables, and less fiddly dice that a lot of my players wouldn't have. Also, many of them were more familiar with Labyrinth Lord, so it was easier to teach.<br/><br/><b>-How did you choose the new system?</b><br/><br/>I review a lot of OSR rulesets and picked what I thought had a good balance of simplicity and the kind of flavor I wanted out of my game.<br/><br/><b>-Did you keep the same characters, or did you just use the same setting/world?</b><br/><br/>Same characters, different setting, but it is implied that it is at least in the same world.<br/><br/><b>-How did you handle the conversion of specific mechanics, gear, powers, abilities, traits, etc. to the new system?</b><br/><br/>The vast majority of my players do not have a lot of RPG experience under their belts, so we just rebuilt each character with the same stats and took the abilities from the LotFP book based on class. Thankfully, both games share the same 7 classes. The only real grumbling was that the players of demihumans lost their infravision, but they got over it.<br/><br/><b>-How did it affect the narrative development of your game?</b><br/><br/>Not much at all, the only change was that I moved to more of a hexcrawl/sandbox structure, which DCC could handle as well, despite having less specific rules about movement, encumberance, etc. <br/><br/><b>-Did characters change substantively "in the fiction"?</b><br/><br/>Not at all.<br/><br/><b>-How smooth or rocky was the transition?</b><br/><br/>Fairly smooth. Players took to LotFP a lot more easily (the layout of the character sheet being VERY helpful), but they whined a bit about not having critical hit or spell tables any more. I have been thinking about adding a few of those things.<br/><br/><b>-Was it a collaborative process with your players, or did the work fall mostly on the shoulders of the GM/host?<br/></b><br/><br/>All work fell on me.<br/><br/><b><br/>-Did you find it rewarding, or too much trouble?</b><br/><br/>It has been much more rewarding, mainly because the PC death count is pretty high. I think 15 people have died in 7 sessions. This means that people need to make new characters quite often, as well as backups. For newbie DnD players, the LotFP rules are a lot easier to grok, and I ended up putting a character creation packet together for them that only needed to be two pages long.<br/><br/><b>-How far along was the original game when you made the switch?</b><br/><br/>We had played 5 or 6 sessions with the DCC rules, and we just finished our 7th session of LotFP last night. There are only 3 PCs left from when we were using the old rules. The other 8 or so were made exclusively in LotFP.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404627/#Comment_404627" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-25T21:05:33+00:00" title="January 25, 2013  9:05PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool, thanks!

Let me do one of the more interesting ones<br/><br/>-What systems were they?<br/><br/>Fantasy Hero -&gt; Cold Iron -&gt; AD&amp;D<br/><br/>-Why did you decide to switch?<br/><br/>Fantasy Hero was showing issues with character concepts easily overshadowed by other PCs (like one PC was a "bard", the other PCs decided to learn some bardic skills to have a party "disguise", a few of the other PCs were instantly better musicians because they had high Presence scores, they had a choice of a skill rating of 8 or 15 or something like that where the bard had a 12). Also combat took a long time. And I wanted some Cold Iron gaming. And then Cold Iron combats still took a long time, so we decided to switch to AD&amp;D which more folks knew and had reasonably quick combat. There may have even been another game system in there...<br/><br/>-How did you choose the new system?<br/><br/>Cold Iron because I liked it (Cold Iron is another college friend's game system). AD&amp;D because it was quicker, simpler, and more well known.<br/><br/>-Did you keep the same characters, or did you just use the same setting/world?<br/><br/>Same characters.<br/><br/>-How did you handle the conversion of specific mechanics, gear, powers, abilities, traits, etc. to the new system?<br/><br/>Just picked levels and classes and skills to best represent the character concepts and developments from play.<br/><br/>-How did it affect the narrative development of your game?<br/><br/>It definitely shifted the emphasis towards more combat.<br/><br/>-Did characters change substantively "in the fiction"?<br/><br/>There were definite impacts to the fiction because of the mechanical changes.<br/><br/>-How smooth or rocky was the transition?<br/><br/>The transition to Cold Iron was definitely rocky, as a system it definitely created dissonance for the players. AD&amp;D was more comfortable to them and mostly represented their character concepts well.<br/><br/>-Was it a collaborative process with your players, or did the work fall mostly on the shoulders of the GM/host?<br/><br/>Mostly on my shoulders but certainly with input from the players.<br/><br/>-Did you find it rewarding, or too much trouble?<br/>-How far along was the original game when you made the switch?<br/><br/>We had been playing for 3 or 4 months, the Cold Iron for a month or two, then AD&amp;D for maybe a year.<br/><br/>Any system goes - trad to indie, indie to trad, trad to trad, indie to indie, whatever.<br/><br/>Well, depends on what you mean by indie. Cold Iron is absolutely an Indie game by Ron Edwards definition, but it's certainly a trad system from a mechanical standpoint, more of a OD&amp;D/AD&amp;D trad than Hero System trad.<br/><br/>Frank<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonT" title="JasonT"><img alt="JasonT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonT">JasonT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404716/#Comment_404716" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-26T22:15:27+00:00" title="January 26, 2013 10:15PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>What systems were they?</b><br/>Deadlands to Castle Falkenstein. (We played the game start to finish with the Castle Falkenstein rules, including character creation, so I'll skip questions relating to how the transition went. To this day, my players have no idea what the actual Deadlands rules are like.)<br/><br/><b>Why did you decide to switch?</b><br/>I just wanted to run something in the Deadlands setting, but the mechanics seemed more fiddly than I wanted to deal with at the time.<br/><br/><b>How did you choose the new system?</b><br/>Castle Falkenstein was already my favorite system at the time. Plus, the playing-card-based system was already thematically appropriate for a "Weird West" game.<br/><br/><b>How did you handle the conversion of specific mechanics, gear, powers, abilities, traits, etc. to the new system?</b><br/>For the most part, I just took Castle Falkenstein's stuff and rephrased it to sound appropriate for the Deadlands Setting (like renaming the appropriately Victorian-sounding "Fisticuffs" attribute to more Wild-West-sounding "Brawlin'"). The one thing I kept from Deadlands was the mechanic that has you making poker hands when you want to cast magic spells. I think I arbitrarily came up for a new, super-quick rule for determining whether Harrowed characters lost control to their manitou (which came down to just drawing a card from the deck and secretly signaling to the player whether they just went bad).<br/><br/><b>How did it affect the narrative development of your game?</b><br/>The main reasons I picked that system were that it never gets bogged down in number-crunching and it puts more narrative control into players' hands than a dice-based system. Things stayed focused on story and always kept moving.<br/><br/><b>Was it a collaborative process with your players, or did the work fall mostly on the shoulders of the GM/host?</b><br/>I did all the work ahead of time.<br/><br/><b>Did you find it rewarding, or too much trouble?</b> <br/>I loved it, and my players were already sold on Falkenstein from an earlier campaign, so it was easy to get them on board. And thanks for reminding me, as I now have a hankering to run something new with the Falkenstein rules...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
