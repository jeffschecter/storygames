I was cleaning out my basement and I found this great old D&amp;D module from '78. Me and a few of my grade school friends used to play it at lunch. One time we were even playing it in the back of home room and Ms. Fleischer confiscated it. She gave it back\xa0at the end of the day. She said she'd thumbed through it and it looked like it was good for our vocabulary, but to leave it at home. Anyway, remember this one?<br/><br/>A. Suhaugin Gaol<br/><br/><i>Your party is trapped in a subterranean prison and your personal belongings are all gone! As you peer through the coral bars of your stockade you see a suhaugin jailer leaning sleepily against his guisarme.

Torture Chamber<br/><br/><i>This area appears to have been carved out of a porous rock or some sort of coral. There are three live prisoners, and at least a dozen corpses in various stages of decay, their mouths open, their visages contorted in masks of unbelievable pain. Green-black, slimy vines or tentacles and the occasional eel slither in and out of holes in the floor, walls, and ceiling, moving over the bodies. The eels appear to be carrying some kind of species of off-white leech, parasites on their black, slimy skin. When the eels stop to feed on the prisoners, the leeches often detach themselves and attempt to enter their bodies through the nearest available orifice (mouth, eyes, ears, nose, genitals, anus, or any open wounds).<br/><br/>At the far end of the chamber, there is an opening in the floor of the room: a hole in the ground that opens on an inky-black pool of water. Set into one of the walls is a massive door of rusted iron.</i><br/><br/>Monsters: Torture eels and vine-tentacles (uncountable) Treasure: The leeches, if carried out of the dungeon alive, are valued at 10 g.p. a piece by Conclave alchemists.<br/><br/><br/>[Or is this not a make-your-own-dungeon thread?
