I was playing a Chopper to middling effect and figured this break was the perfect chance to come up with something that would give me more face time and a bigger role in shaping the ongoing plot.<br/><br/>The roles of Hardholder and Operator are taken, and that's fine because I don't want to do that.  What I'd <i>like</i> to do is create a character almost straight out of <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>: a hellfire-and-brimstone preacher with a gun and a mission from the Lord to make right those things that aren't so.  Into the sinful nest of the hardhold he comes, ready to spread death and the Gospel in equal measure.<br/><br/>But how to bring this character to life?<br/><br/>If you're familiar with <i>Apocalypse World</i> you know that characters are drawn from a set of predetermined archetypes.  There's some wiggle room in them to account for player taste, but each is meant to occupy a specific role and have abilities distinct from one another.  So which best fits the Preacher?<br/><br/>The first and most obvious choice would be a Hocus.  Spreading a faith is part and parcel of their role, after all.  But they also come saddled with a congregation of followers and that doesn't fit my wandering-figure-of-retribution concept.  There's Battlebabe, but despite the name the Battlebabe actually isn't all that tough, so that's out, too.<br/><br/>I figure some combination of archetype and improvement might do the trick.  Because Benhimself, the MC, is generous, he's allowing me to port over the improvement slots I earned with my last character so I have two I can take right away.  I also have four circles filled so I'm <i>this</i> close to getting a third.<br/><br/>So you can see what I'm after here: a hardened drifter with a head full of the Good Book and a handful of shootin' iron.  A wasteland prophet with little time for the sinful save to fill them full of lead.  I don't believe it's impossible to realize this idea using the system, but I'm just not fluent enough with <i>Apocalypse World</i>, despite playing in a game of it for weeks, to do it without help.<br/><br/><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000N60GV4/thehawfam-20" rel="nofollow"><img alt="Call of Ju\xe1rez" height="350" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/callofjuarez.jpg" title="Call of Ju\xe1rez" width="560"/></a></div> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_250297">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250297/#Comment_250297" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-11T07:41:43+00:00" title="January 11, 2010  7:41AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some initial thoughts and people can feel free to correct me if I'm totally off the mark:<br/><br/>After some chat with Benhimself, we figure that the followers option for a Hocus can be tweaked a bit to mean not a group of people that follow him around, but pockets of the faithful that exist here and there in hardholds around the wasteland.  Kind of like how a <i>DitV</i> character encounters those folks in each town who believe.  This takes one of my concerns out of the equation.<br/><br/>Anyway, following on the Hocus path, I figure I can start the character process with the following stat block: Cool-1 Hard+1 Hot=0 Sharp+1 Weird+2.  Taking <i>Fortunes</i>, as set aside by the playbook, I can follow up with <i>Frenzy</i> and <i>Charismatic</i>.  These allow the Preacher \u2014 who I've taken to calling Brother Zedekiah \u2014 the opportunity to seize upon groups of followers and turn them to his (sometimes destructive) will.  And <i>Charismatic</i> allows him to bypass his totally average Hot to use Weird instead.<br/><br/>Because of Benhimself's generosity, I have two improvements to work with.  One will offset the Cool-1 I'm saddled with: <i>Spooky Intense</i>, taken from the Savvyhead's playbook.  This turns his "acting under fire" disadvantage to a net advantage by linking it to Weird.<br/><br/>So would the second improvement be <i>Fucking Wacknut</i>?  That boosts his Weird to +3, therefore making his Cool and Hot replacements that much more effective.  I like the idea of taking more Hard, though, and boosting the utility of his big gun.  I do have that other improvement right around the corner, though.  Should I wait, or just go with improving Hard now?  I mean, Weird+2 is nothing to sneeze at.<br/><br/>And did I just solve my own problem?  I don't know.  I'm still not as confident with <i>Apocalypse World</i> as I could be, and that means I could be totally screwing myself with this build.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_250321">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250321/#Comment_250321" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-11T10:31:11+00:00" title="January 11, 2010 10:31AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When you want your guy to be a hellrazer, Not to Be Fucked With is always a good thing to take.<br/><br/>Your crazy high weird and preacher typeness could also benefit from Visions of Death, 'specially now that Sammy's out of the picture.<br/><br/>You could also take Insano Like Drano for a possible total of +3 Hard.<br/><br/>And if you're planning on going aggro a lot...

Do you want to actually convince people to come round to your faith, or do you just want to say bad-ass shit that nobody listens to until after you fill the holding full of holes? The Hocus comes with a cult, always. That's the character. The Battlebabe is mostly just weak at seizing by force, the only move you can't switch the stat for -- but really good at moving through a battle while the other characters do the killing, and really good at manipulating people. That picture looks like a Gunlugger, who is weak in the Hot stat, but you can switch the Hot moves to Cool or Weird. You can also take the Hocus Speak Truth to a Crowd move from Hocus as one of your other playbook moves to get the firey orator thing down.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_250479">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250479/#Comment_250479" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-12T09:31:02+00:00" title="January 12, 2010  9:31AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's no car in that picture, but you said nomadic, so Driver could be another option, though probably not what you're thinking (Preacher Zeb and the Faithmobile!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_250480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250480/#Comment_250480" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-12T09:41:44+00:00" title="January 12, 2010  9:41AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you're going the all-weird route, you could also take Bonefeel to always, always be there on the scene.<br/><br/>I'd also consider taking "Things Speak" from the Savvyhead - at least if Ben can be convinced to treat towns and small societies as "things."

Some characters like the Hardholder start off more important in the fiction by way of being leader-type figures...but they're leaders on a very small scale.<br/><br/>AW is not about playing larger than life characters.  Its about playing through a slice in the life of people.  Its more "documentary" than "heroic fantasy".  You might wind up with a story where your guy winds up being the hero.  You might wind up being a bit player in the story of someone elses heroics.  Or there might be no hero in the story at all.  Its not that type of game.  <br/><br/>Its "the world is a hard place, here's how you've been suriving in it, here's a bunch of nasty preasure that's building up against you and the way you've been surviving, here's a bunch of other people who are trying to survive in their own way whom you may or may not trust and who may or may not trust you....go"<br/><br/>Going into it evisioning yourself as playing the lead in a post apoc movie...IMO...not likely to be fun for you at all.

In AW you're just as likely to find that while you wanted to pronounce judgement, the folks you were judging didn't give a crap, and ignored and laughed at you.  And that while you wanted to be a badass you actually got put down like a punk by a little girl with a stick the first time you tried to pull you gun and get all "Roland" on someone's ass.<br/>\n<br/>\nCuz AW's system doesn't care what sort of character you wanted to play.  It only cares about what choice you are making right now this moment and how badly that choice hoses you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_250651">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour" title="FigureFour"><img alt="FigureFour" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour">FigureFour</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250651/#Comment_250651" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-13T12:45:36+00:00" title="January 13, 2010 12:45PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At the risk of dragging things further off topic, I still don't really get what you're saying.<br><br>So his badass rolls into town and pronounces judgement, but no one cares.

When was the last time you went into a game saying "I really want to play a character whose concept is that he is A, B &amp; C" but once play started you didn't really care whether you got to actually be A, B &amp; C?  Most people who start off with a really powerful notion of wanting A, B, &amp; C are going to expect to get A, B &amp; C out of play and be disappointed if they don't, no?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn AW you can TRY to get A, B, &amp; C...and maybe you'll get to be that and maybe you won't.  So the point I was making is that going into AW with a really powerful notion of what you want for your character has a high probability of leading to disappointment.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetter is to go into AW with an open mind.  Instead of starting play with a powerful notion of your character, start play with a powerful notion of the situation your character finds themself in after that first introductory session.  And then get joy in discovering your character through how they interact with that situation.  Sure have an idea in the back of your mind that informs how you play, but be flexible enough to realize that your choices might lead you to a very different place.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of Vincent's games are about discovering your character through play...not about starting play with the character already fully realized.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_250662">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour" title="FigureFour"><img alt="FigureFour" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour">FigureFour</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250662/#Comment_250662" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-13T13:30:15+00:00" title="January 13, 2010  1:30PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK.

I don't see how Apocalypse World will prevent him from having an attitude or passing judgement on people.<br><br>Sadly, I haven't played as many of Vincent's games as I'd like, so maybe I don't have a lot of experience with what you're talking about, but both my AW characters have started with a concept about as firm as Sam's and I haven't had a problem with either of them (and I certainly have discovered more about them through play).<br><br>Like I said, Sam's concept seems to be about his belief in the Bible, Guns and Judgement. Even if "the game doesn't let him" be that guy, the worst thing I can see happening is that the character questions his faith.
