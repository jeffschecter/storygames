Yes stuff happens, no stuff doesn't happen. Resolve that stuff, because there's a 50:50 chance you get a die out of it. It's up to you whether it happens. When you're not the storyteller, either a) come up with stuff that's really easy for the storyteller to resolve, or b) (Vincent told me this one) come up with stuff that's so awesome that it distracts the other participants from their own interests.<br/><br/>Especially with that GM thing, I think a lot of story gamers are all about not throwing down the GM fiat gauntlet, but in this game it's cool because everyone gets a turn.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152551">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Meguey" title="Meguey"><img alt="Meguey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lumpley.com/megweb/dollz/1001.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Meguey">Meguey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152551/#Comment_152551" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-23T17:23:54+00:00" title="June 23, 2008  5:23PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool! Yeah, there's a mass of power waiting to be used there. The second key is, in order to earn those dice, you have to follow and resolve the stuff the other players bring to the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
