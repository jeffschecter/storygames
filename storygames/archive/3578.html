It means being fully engaged, getting everything out of every moment.

I will always hold to the fact players feel they need long campaigns for character depth to occur because they are playing soft and slow.<br/><br/>Hard and fast, the only way - living up to it for each and every session is the difficult bit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_80600">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80600/#Comment_80600" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-11T08:52:33+00:00" title="July 11, 2007  8:52AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 11, 2007 8:53AM by Remi.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me an important aspect of playing hard is that while I give all I can in the game, when it's over, I've can leave it 'on the field'.

You need to grease the wheels of interaction with the balm of civilization, so to speak.  You hold back.  There's a lot of fuzzy boundaries around who speaks when and for how long and if you can interrupt and how strongly you should emote and what level of hyperbole is appropriate and yadda yadda yadda.<br/><br/>In a game that's robust enough to 'play hard' you don't have to worry about any of that, because the game handles those issues.  I don't have to, for instance, worry about whether or not I'm letting you get your say because your say is guaranteed by the procedure of the game (or the game disburses everyone's say in inequal but agreed-upon ways).  The game replaces all those fuzzy boundaries with sharply defied boundaries that everyone agrees to follow and can be looked up in the game book.  Without worrying on all the differing interpretations of where those boundaries are, without worrying about making sure everything is kosher, without worrying about whether everyone is having fun, you can let go and experience the moment.  You can play as hard as you want, knowing that you aren't going to hurt or trample anybody in the process.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_80650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow" title="Neil Gow"><img alt="Neil Gow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/084/nS7S5AMIXMIH0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow">Neil Gow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80650/#Comment_80650" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-11T11:15:13+00:00" title="July 11, 2007 11:15AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I view playing hard as being THERE, at the table, fully engaged in everything that happens whether it is happening to you or not.

Maybe that's all written down or maybe we talk it out before play, but it's important that everybody be in alignment on how things work procedurally.  The game should make this happen.<br/><br/>Agency - the game should allow me to make strong choices that have real consequences.  If winning and losing are not equally interesting outcomes, that is problematic.  The game should mechanically push toward and reward challenging, eventful, satisfying conflicts.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_80724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80724/#Comment_80724" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-11T16:18:35+00:00" title="July 11, 2007  4:18PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And put transparency and agency together, so you always know when you have a say -- and, importantly, you know when you don't.

It's the underlying goals that are the difference.<br/><br/>When you are providing opposition or providing adversity (they're nearly synonymous), first of all, you are <em>providing</em> -- you're doing something <em>for the other player</em>, you are hitting the buttons that they want hit, you are giving them something that gives them an opportunity to shine.  Your goal in providing opposition is to throw in just enough friction so that the protagonists 'feel the burn' and they enjoy their struggles.  Importantly, when they seize that opportunity and they do shine despite your opposition, their victory is not your loss.<br/><br/>When you are competiting, you are doing it for yourself.  You are trying to chalk up a victory for you.  The other players exist to be defeated, and you do not especially care if they enjoy themselves.  In fact, you want to make them suffer just a little bit, because your victory <em>is</em> their loss, and their victory <em>is</em> your loss.<br/><br/>Now, you can compete and end up generating appropriate opposition, but this isn't quite the same thing.  For instance, in a friendly game of basketball where you're all relatively evenly matched, the strong competition between the players might <em>just happen</em> to provide just enough opposition that playing is fun.  But you're still competing; you're not really there to provide opposition.  It's not your purpose in playing.  Also, if you throw in one really good player or one really bad player, and all the sudden the competition isn't calibrated opposition, is a blowout, and is not a lot of fun.<br/><br/>Does that unmurkify any?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_81143">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81143/#Comment_81143" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-13T14:42:27+00:00" title="July 13, 2007  2:42PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great post, Joshua                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kintara" title="Kintara"><img alt="Kintara" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kintara">Kintara</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81152/#Comment_81152" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-13T15:59:01+00:00" title="July 13, 2007  3:59PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 13, 2007 4:00PM by Kintara.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My definition of playing hard is rather masochistic.

I want to laugh gleefully when my character wins a glorious victory, and laugh gleefully (if only in my own mind) when he's ripped to shreds as his world collapses around him.<br/><br/>That's one of two preferred modes of playing (the other being more about having an opportunity to see some aspect of my character spotlighted, sort of like having a chance to really use or play with a newly bought toy or gadget, essentially similar to the above but less about conflict).<br/><br/>You know, I should try to push that first one more with my character generation. Too often I design characters based on that second model (designing a pretty toy instead of fragile piece of modern art for me and the other players to knock over).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_81155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brandon%20A" title="Brandon A"><img alt="Brandon A" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fusionofthought.com/pics/handy.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brandon%20A">Brandon A</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81155/#Comment_81155" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-13T16:50:33+00:00" title="July 13, 2007  4:50PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am really enjoying this conversation.  I have two questions to throw into the mix.<br/><br/>My group plays a lot of different systems (we more to a different system/game after no more than about 6 sessions.)  One of things that I worry about happening is that a lack of familiarity with the rules is hampering our ability to play hard and it is breaking the mood/flow.  So the question is this:  Is there any advice on how to handle this other than, "learn the rules better!"?  <br/><br/>My biggest problem, personally, with playing hard is my own innate character protection.  I want my dude to be awesome and losing conflicts just doesn't <i>feel</i> awesome.  So I always try to win, and I usually do (due to strong character builds.)  So this is my question.  Is there any advice on how to convert my mindset from "I gotta protect my dude" to "Bring it on!"?  A corollary of to this is that I have trouble really challenging another player's core beliefs for his guy because it seems, well ... mean.<br/><br/>Playing hard sounds fun and we say we are going to do it and then it is the same style as usual (which is fun, but I think it could be more fun.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81158">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/blankshield" title="blankshield"><img alt="blankshield" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.blankshieldpress.com/jamesgoplay.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/blankshield">blankshield</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81158/#Comment_81158" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-13T17:00:34+00:00" title="July 13, 2007  5:00PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 13, 2007 5:01PM by blankshield.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brandon: Build a bunch of mook NPC's, with enough flavour to be evocative.

There's <i>providing adversity</i> and there's also <i>being vulnerable</i>. There's a science and an art to making characters who are vulnerable in some way. Characters who care about something that they are likely to lose. Who want things they may not be able to get. Who don't just overcome challenges, but <i>take risks</i>.<br/><br/>If a character is made to beat challenges, there's only one kind of adversity that suits it: escalating the difficulty of challanges, but never so far as to make them impossible (because then the 'awesome build' is useless). This, to me, gets boring real fast.<br/><br/>A key to good story gaming (and playing hard), IMO, is one of the keys to great fiction: flawed, vulnerable characters who can fail, and fail, and fail some more.

Try making a character that you sympathize with, but don't particularly wish to be. Or play a character you admire for what they stand for, but don't give him the power to make taking those positions easy. It's pretty simple, really: just don't make the character awesome. Make the character as if he were the star in a tragedy. Picture his inevitable and bloody end first and think backwards so you can set yourself up.<br/><br/>This is easier if you're playing in a system that has a reward system that allows you to be rewarded for doing that stuff. It also helps if everyone else is trying to do something similar. You're not going to feel comfortable playing like this if you feel like a drunken, one-legged hobo following around a team of black ops agents.<br/><br/>Edit: John is wise.<br/><br/>Edit2: Here's a simple thing.

And Tony definitely gets points on the assist.<br/><br/>But at some point, it comes down to this: Brandon, what's fun? For you. <br/><br/>I'm not being dismissive here. I've been thinking a lot about this. <br/><br/>I was talking to a woman who works as a writer on video games last week, and so of course we ended up talking about stories and games.<br/><br/>And at one point I said, "But here the thing: Stories are about how it's hard to be a human being. Video games are about how it's great to be fucking cool!"<br/><br/>Video games -- and sporting events, and so on.<br/><br/>As others have pointed out before me, the pleasures found in making story and competing are different. They fire up different parts of us. <br/><br/>I like both, but some people might be more predisposed to like one or the other.<br/><br/>While Joshua and Tony are right that using the right system that won't punish a player for making his characters life more difficult (and might even reward the player for such behavior) is vital, it doesn't change the fact that some people might not actually want it. And John's post about Brandon's play supports this premise.<br/><br/>My guess is Brandon is either wanting to do this because his posse is doing this and he wants to play along but sort of going against his own nature, or he's really curious about it but can't find a way in for his brain.<br/><br/>If the latter, system will only carry so far. (If the former, I don't know what to say.)<br/><br/>I suppose this is the point in the thread where where I get accused of promoting mysticism (which, by the way, is an insult to both mysticism and myself), but the right rules set won't be enough to make this happen. At some level the squishiness of human heart as an arbiter of what works, what is good, enters the equation.<br/><br/>Brandon, you say you want to play hard in this mode because it sounds fun. And it is. But the question is, are you curious about putting ideas and issues and moral behavior and all the ickiness of what it means to be alive as a human being on the table and looking at it. <br/><br/>How one "wins" in this game <i>is</i> by pushing hard against the other players thematically, getting your own PC in trouble. That's the win. When those moments come up, that's the equivalent of a fantastic pass during a football game. And, like winning in a game of chess or playing a great game of baseball, it requires a building of skill sets to get there. <br/><br/>It's not as obvious in some ways as doing a strong character point-build because there are aesthetic issues involved -- what works to get that response of everyone at the table going, "Oooh," because of a choice you make for your character might not hop out at first. <br/><br/>And yet... It's also kind of obvious. A writing question a writer can ask himself when stuck is, "What's the worst thing that could happen?" So, when playing your character, ask that and then take action on that. My guess is you'll soon start playing "well" in this crazy story mode. The trick is for you to follow what YOU think would be the worst thing that could happen. That's when you're addressing Premise -- when you put what matters to you right there on the table for all to see.<br/><br/>By the way...<br/><br/> "worst" doesn't mean "over". If a player flags an NPC as a character they are interested in, the worst thing that could happen is NOT that the NPC dies. That ENDS the relationship. It's like crushing a bug a child has shown interest in. When going for "worst," try to deepen the relationship or problem. If someone's PC take an interest in a child, don't kill the child and say, "There's a Bang for ya!" Have the child come to the PC in desperation, needing something from the PC that will cost the PC a lot, make the PC's life more complicated and so on. <br/><br/>When Banging, prolong the Banging, go deeper with the Banging. The goal is not to end the Banging. The point of Banging is to keep the Banging going...  <br/><br/>And the same is true of Players and their PCs -- make decisions that only get PC into deeper water, more troubles. Don't say, "Well, he does this because that's a horrible thing to have happen," if it closes off possibilities. Instead ask, "What would make all situations from this point on more complicated." <br/><br/>And if something does get closed off through death or whatever, how can that moment haunt the PC. Macbeth kills Banquo to serve his own ends. Of course, Shakespeare is smart enough to keep Banquo in the play -- and only cause more trouble for our main character..)<br/><br/>Christopher                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_81312">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

The way <em>I've</em> dealt with it is to give someone <em>else</em> the job of complicating things (Antags and Audience in Shock:, Opposition in Under the Bed) and making certain of your resources inherently complicate things (Links in Shock:) What that means is, when you first create the Protag, you write down some things that are in your interest: your Features show stuff about your character that are usually pretty surface things ("I've got a gun" or "I'm the President") that help you out no matter what. Then you've got Links that are the things you fight <em>about</em>. The game puts you in a position where you have to fight over those. And the other players at the table are putting you in a position to fight over them all the time. Then, once you're throwing dice, you've got to decide which outcome you care about the most. So if you want, you can have the best intentions for the guy; the rules and your fellow players are there to complicate things. The only place I've seen where it might fall down \xe2\u20ac\u201d and this stems from deeply dysfunctional play \xe2\u20ac\u201d is when you can't play an Antagonist well, where you pull punches and make wussy choices for the Protag. I doubt that'll be an issue for you, since you're asking about how to push hard.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81584">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brandon%20A" title="Brandon A"><img alt="Brandon A" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fusionofthought.com/pics/handy.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brandon%20A">Brandon A</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81584/#Comment_81584" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-17T01:09:16+00:00" title="July 17, 2007  1:09AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So tonight is our first session since this discussion.

Stakes that are interesting win or lose don't mean that you shouldn't care about the outcome.  The more invested you (yes you, the person at the table) are in the stakes, the more fun the conflict will be.  Just make sure that the side you're not fighting for is also a punch you can roll with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_81711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81711/#Comment_81711" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-17T10:26:53+00:00" title="July 17, 2007 10:26AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Hey Brandon, I want to point out that most of the stuff you crossed out can be hella fun.

You are setting up something bad and don't want any consequences."  So we talked about it, and decided that I protecting my family was the right thing to do, but the way I did it revealed that my character knew about the bad voodoo that is going on and didn't tell anyone (because psst he is secretly in league with them.)  So yeah, in the past I wouldn't have wanted to reveal that because that would be bad.  Here I get to both get what I want and set a great scene for later when I am confronted about not doing anything.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_81945">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brandon%20A" title="Brandon A"><img alt="Brandon A" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fusionofthought.com/pics/handy.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brandon%20A">Brandon A</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81945/#Comment_81945" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-18T02:47:26+00:00" title="July 18, 2007  2:47AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 18, 2007 2:48AM by Brandon A.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and Tony, is that a challenge?
