                    Hello Storygamers. <br/>
Welcome to my first post. I'm going to kick off my arrival with a bang: an Actual Play report from my first game in another world.<br/>
<br/>
So I finally got around to gathering a new group for a HeroQuest game. I moved from Norway to England six months ago, so I've left my old gaming buddies behind. Fortunately I now work with a fairly geeky lot, so the challenge was more in working up motivation than actually finding possible candidates. <br/>
<br/>
About a month ago I put things in motion and invited three of my workmates to a character generation session for a HeroQuest set in Shadow World, the high fantasy setting originally designed for RoleMaster. The first session took place about two weeks later, but by the group had swollen to five, thanks to a Vampire: Dark Ages game one of the players in my game arranged. What happened was that two of the players of that game, hearing that another one was afoot basically invited themselves into mine, asking when we would play next. Five players really is more than my preferred group size, but I wasn't going to kick them _out_ once they evidently saw themselves as being _in_ so I rolled with it.<br/>
<br/>
The game takes place in Haalkitaine, capitol of the Rhakhaan Empire. After hundreds of years of lethargy, the Empire is again in an expansive mood, eager to exert its dominance over the neighbouring realms. Presently the Imperial court is abuzz with intrigue as the Empress Italana VI is dying and her heir, who has been effectively ruling for the preceding years, is preparing to formally assume the crown as Emperor Jerrin III.<br/>
<br/>
The Players:<br/>
Serevii Enataxa (played by Henrik) is an Iylar elf, captured from the Pirate Republic Plasidar two hundred years ago. Since then she's been a hostage at the court, spending her days playing harpsicord for the courtiers. Secretly she is an initate of Orgiana, a rather nasty and violently feminist goddess of darkness and pain. She has cultivated this relationship through her seniority in a secret cult for predominantly bored, young ladies of the court. While outwardly resigned, she yearns for freedom and to establish a community where women rule and men are put in their place.<br/>
<br/>
Edvar Deyloth (Per Erik) is the dispossessed son of Baron Novington. The baron was accused of conspiring against the empress, but murdered by brigands before his trial and posthumously condemned and stripped of rank. Edvar was accused on unknown charges and imprisoned without trial, but later rescued by his father's armsmaster. He has arrived in Haalkitaine wearing his father's sword, sworn to revenge against his enemies and to join the Phoenix Guard (the imperial body guard) as his father before his ennoblement.<br/>
<br/>
Bas Vog (Magnus) is an Erlin elf and famed minstrel from Quendara in southern Rhakhaan. He has come to Haalkitaine to agitate against the depredations of his forest homelands, where many new lumbercamps produce building materials for the Imperial ship building projects. He also seeks to unlock the powers of the lost language Iruaric.<br/>
<br/>
Karfans the Grey (Patrik) is young cavalry scout, experienced from the tribal wars of his Saralian homelands. Lured by rumours of wars of conquest he has arrived in Haalkitaine with three fellow horsemen in search of wealth and adventure.<br/>
<br/>
Kasters Bor (Andreas) joined the 3d Rhakhaan Army ten years ago to fight in the Wuliris campaign. Now a hardened veteran of many desperate battles, he's back in Haalkitaine, content to drink and gamble away his pension while trying to forget his fallen comrades.<br/>
<br/>
(Some more context: Two of these five are new to roleplaying. Andreas had done a little bit of D&amp;D many years ago, while Patrik's first rpg experience ever was the mentioned Vampire: Dark Ages game.)                </div>

                            The First Session:<br/>
Quite a lot of time was spent going over the rules and finishing the characters. I'd filled out keywords based on the previously discussed concepts; what remained was defining free abilities and allocating bonus points. My attempts at explaining conflict resolution went largely over their heads, so eventually we cut that short and went on with the actual gaming. While discussing characters I'd encouraged the players to make thematically coherent, but not necessarily group oriented characters. My idea for this game was to start play with independent scenes and tie the characters together as we went along. At the time of the first session I had some ideas on how to do this, including a half sketched relationship map, but if this is actually going to work out remains to be seen.<br/>
<br/>
Serevii had the first scene. I described how she was attending a ball, playing her harpsicord and basically zoning out when she noticed a young man hovering close to her and displaying an uncommon enthusiasm, obviously somewhat embarassing to his friends/entourage. Serevii recognised him the son of the Duke Changor, and she seized the opportunity to seduce him, with the goal of gaining him as a patron (after some light prodding from me). Bring on the first test of the game, a conflict Henrik lost, the minor defeat interpreted as Lord Morvan being offended by the Iylar hostage's crass grab for his purse. (I'd considered making it an extended conflict, but the scene was dragging out and I needed to move on to the next player)<br/>
<br/>
Bas Vog had his moment as he passed through the city gates. He was brusquely hailed by the gate seargent (on suspicion of being an elf) and called in for questioning. Upon examining his travel papers the seargent accused him of being a vagabond and conspiring with known criminals. Bas Vog insisted on demonstrating his credentials and honesty by performing the ballad of the Lonely Squirrel (The topic was a bit .. silly, but I decided to accept it), and acchieved a Complete Success on his conflict. The guards were deeply moved by his peformance and let him move on without further questions.<br/>
<br/>
Karfans the Grey and two of his men were seated in a tavern as Bas Vog moved in. At the other end of the room a group of soldiers were drinking up a storm and eyeing the Saralians malvolently. One of them got up and moved over to Karfans, insulting him and trying to goad him into a fight. Karfans stood up and calmly in the eye, telling him exactly what would happen to him if he didn't get out of his face. The soldier quailed and turned back to his table, throwing out a few more hollow insults as he went. (Conflict: get the soldier to back down. I was surprised by this; I had expected this to end with a fight, but it didn't. I'm guessing most 'experienced roleplayers' would have gone for the violent solution here. Patrik almost tried to get it both ways though; afer the conflict he wanted Karfans to throw his mug at the retreating soldier. I probably was a bit too stern when I asked if Patrik _really_ intended to pick a fight, but in any case that action was retracted) The scene ended with Bas Vog throwing a salute to Karfans, and Karfans raising his mug in a friendly response.<br/>
<br/>
Edvar meanwhile had found his way to a dingy brothel in a slummy area. A bit short on cash, he decided to take advantage of a drunk slumped in the corner by challenging him to a game of cards. The drunk of course happened to be Kasters, and so the fourth confilct of the game became PvP. Andreas (Kasters) lost the conflict, and Edvar went off to slake his lost with what was left of Kasters' pension.<br/>
<br/>
Kasters/Andreas didn't take this kindly and made his next intent to waylay Edvar outside the brothel as he left. Another simple contest which ended with Victory to Andreas, and Kasters making off with Edvar's ancestral sword (since the money was gone), Per Erik wasn't too happy when I refused him a repeat attempt, I'll tell you that. He opted out of giving chase though, so he gave in for now. However, to add insult to injury, Andreas chose to escalate the conflict by spending a Hero Point to cement his relationship to the very fine sword.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And here endeth the session.<br/>
I've glossed over the exact abilities and augments used in the conflicts, partly of expediency, partly to avoid going too deep into system mechanics and partly because I don't remember.<br/>
Any and all comments are appreciated, particularily ideas on how to tie all this together. I started this with an intent to do something different, both for myself and to break veteran gamers out of ingrained party thinking. I need to forge some links between them though, or I could as well run five separate solo games. As I said before, I have some ideas for linkage, but I have to solidify them.                        </div>

                            One of my ideas for the next session involve Serevii, the Imperial hostage. She's an interesting character, but it can seem difficult to find a purpose for here within the confines of what is basically a guilded prison. To make things interesting I'm thinking of having the Empress summon her to her deathbed to confide in her. Something innocous related to her youthful membership in the Orgiana cult, but such a private confession will instantly make Serevii interesting to _everyone_ in the court.<br/>
My idea for Kasters involves having a crime boss call in gambling debts, which he can't possibly pay. The suggestion is that he settle the score by offing a troublesome guy, which turns out to be a drinking/gambling buddy of Kasters'.<br/>
As for the others.. well, I'm sure I can come up with something, but as of yet I don't have anything particularily interesting.  They have one urgent need in common, which is to find employment. And of course, Edvar is livid with the desire to track down and kill the thief who stole his sword.                        </div>

                            Nice example of a game with many individual character threads - i'm gming a Burning Wheel game that is unfolding much like this, although i've tried to make sure all the characters have vip npcs in common. Care to give me some insight on how your players acted when it wasn't their scene? How'd they interface with the action, when away from their protagonist?<br/><br/>Also, i gather you are fishing for some advice on how best to tie your character's stories together, yes? &gt;_&gt; <br/><br/>What is the situation that is going to get up in these characters' faces? Is it the hostage's cult, the empress's impending death, or isn't there one?  (That might help, or it might not - i like having a clear idea of the big picture, but i'm not the best gm around! <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>

                            major VIP characters in common; yes, that is something I'm trying to arrange, though none of the character's have any VIP-contacts yet - still work in progress. The question kicked one more  idea into place however. Thanks. As for the interaction between the players, I'd love to answer you, but unfortunately I don't remember much more of that. I can tell you that we were seated around a table without much in the way of distractions. Also, I kept the scenes short, to keep things moving. One of my concerns is precisely that with so many players it may be too much dead air between 'turns'. I have been toying with the idea of allowing players to control NPCs, but I think it's too early to introduce that option.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and as for background situation, here's the deal: The starting time of my game is several years before the official Present Time of the setting. What is scripted to happen next is that the next Emperor will assume the throne, but refuse the Phoenix Crown, the magical crown/helmet that helps the ruler maintain order and stability in the realm. The flipside is that the crown also restricts his freedom of action. Consequently his cousin, desiring to be Emperor instead of the Emperor will steal the throne and flee to declare himself the true Emperor.<br/>
I'm going to rewind to before power change, and assume that the cousin had been plotting for a long time already.  Oh, and these events are of course no longer predetermined to take place. <br/>
At the same time, you have a number of border conflicts as the empire struggles to consolidate the conquests initiated during the reign of the old empress. That theme of imperialism was the one I presented to the first three players when we gathered to discuss character concepts.<br/>
<br/>
The cult. I confess to being slightly lost on how to make use of that. We have established that there are many ex-members among the noble ladies of the realm, and that they can become a possible resource. Beyond that I'm fuzzy.                        </div>

                            I haven't used extras yet either. Another option i like is encouraging players to frame their characters, or their characters' influence, into the other player's scenes. It seems like being able to exerpt influence over the other PCs from "off-screen" would be particularly handy for a character like that hostage (or the fanatic cult leader i have in my game). <br/><br/>I like the scenario - has a very Julius Caesar (the play) feel to it, in a way. So you have a brewing civil war (over the secession) and a disintegrating frontier matched up with 3 military-type PCs, an elven minstral, and an elven hostage/cult-leader. And both of the elves have serious grievances against the empire? Sounds pretty good!<br/><br/>My understanding is that HeroQuest is all about religion - so maybe you want to figure out how the cult clashes or cooperates with the other PCs' and major NPCs' religions. Oh, and if the cult is violent and feminist, and the PC is a hostage, i'm imagining that they have it in for both of the would-be-Emperors! (Or at least want to find a woman to hold the winner's leash... sounds like a nice opportunity for romance and betrayal. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/>)                        </div>

                            Hmm.. I'm not entirely sure if I follow you. You're talking about ways for players to contribute to scenes they're not part of, that's clear and cool. As for details, do you mean allowing for use of abilities to author events? Or inserting NPCs from their spheres of influence?<br/>
<br/>
You're right about religion. That's an important part of HeroQuest, and it should be tangible factor in my game. That's a challenge though, because the cultures of Shadow World aren't very deeply developed. So it's not just converting Religions to HeroQuest keyword terms, to a large extent it's creating the religion wholesale from the name of a God and a very few characteristics.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for commenting. Hopefully I will be able to keep the game moving.                        </div>
