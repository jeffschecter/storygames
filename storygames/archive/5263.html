The "reboot" isn't about making Starbuck a hot blonde, or having some dude hallucinate about other hot blondes.  You could keep all the little details of the original series completely intact, but if you changed the <i>mood</i> and manner of execution, you'd still have something worth watching.  (Cf. <i>Star Trek: Next Generation</i>, which wasn't really a reboot at all.  Though the proper nouns all changed, and the budget was a lot bigger, the general outlook is entirely consistent from show to show.  It pretty much explores the same emotional space, with better or worse results depending on your taste.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I think the idea would be: identify what's irrelevant and/or stupid-ass in <i>Lord of the Rings</i>, and deconstruct it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think prime candidates are the role of women, elitism, and militarism.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_118659">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118659/#Comment_118659" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-08T19:31:58+00:00" title="January  8, 2008  7:31PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 8, 2008 7:33PM by James_Nostack.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Season 1, Episode 5: The Spanking</b><br/>\n<i>Prospective Air Date: 1 December 2008</i><br/>\nThe adorably mischievous Witch-King of Angmar is caught throwing water bombs off the balcony of the deluxe apartment in the sky, and Sauron feels that a fitting punishment is a spanking.

But I'm curious, Darcy: what "new artistic purpose" did you have in mind?  Because it sounds like what you're looking for is a High Fantasy, Epic, set more or less in the recognizable parts of Middle-Earth, featuring the canon characters.  Without some specific articulation of what you're looking for, this begins to sounds a lot like just doing Tolkein straight.  <br/><br/>(The fairly obvious contender for doing Tolkein is Burning Wheel, though I could see Shadow of Yesterday working too, or maybe In A Wicked Age for some of the smaller stories out of the Silmarillion.  Midnight d20 is also an option.  There may be a bunch of relatively newer games I know little about, too.)<br/><br/>I think if you want to reimagine Tolkein, it makes sense to step back and look at typical Situations in his work.  Which probably means revisiting a lot of northern European folk tales - the Icelandic sagas, the Niebulungenleid, Wagner's Ring Cycle, Beowulf, that sort of thing.  <br/><br/>One of the troubles with Tolkein-as-relevant-to-Western-Culture is that the stuff Tolkein is talking about resonates very deeply with how our civilization approaches things--and as a result, the sort of archetypes Tolkein conjures up get appropriated by our culture all the time.  Do you remember how the movie version of <i>The Two Towers</i> was used as rhetoric in favor of invading Iraq?  <br/><br/>So, to some extent you've got exactly the opposite problem with the <i>Battlestar Galactica</i> guys: they had a dopey science-fiction story with ideas taken from fringe lunatics like Erich Von Danniken, and they tried to make it resonant by deconstructing it.  Tolkein is already resonsant.  Deconstructing Tolkein necessarily involves deconstructing parts of Western civilization.<br/><br/>Actually one of the better attempts at this is Judd's <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=348339" rel="nofollow">Hateful Orcs</a> game, which, aside from being fun to read, is maybe trying to work within Tolkein's racist framework to show a complex and (at times) admirable culture.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_118737">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118737/#Comment_118737" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-09T07:15:58+00:00" title="January  9, 2008  7:15AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Darcy,<br/><br/>Reboot ideas:<br/><br/>Make Gollum more of a shadow. Much like with Baltar and his imaginary Cylon on BSG, only Frodo should see Gollum. Is Gollum even real? We don't know.<br/><br/>The Witch-King of Angmar has to have more depth. He is the will of Sauron and should enact that will with brutal coldness. He is, of course, one of the ancient kings of men, though, and is an echo of what Aragorn could become. Aragorn and he should be mirrors of one another. <br/><br/>Gondor's stewards should be in the most precarious of positions. Saruman should help stir up sectarian violence and the people should live in fear.<br/><br/>Every character should have a mirror character: Frodo : Gollum, Gandalf : Saruman, Aragorn : Witch-King, Legolas : Galadriel (who should be horrible) - the rest aren't as easy, but could be figured out. Who is right and who is wrong should not be nearly as clear-cut, and should reverse sometimes.<br/><br/>Boromir should be a woman. All the stewards of Gondor should be women.

It also could setup Gandalf as more of a "power-gamer, l33t l00t" guy who's only interest in The Fellowship is to use it to get Frodo as far as Mordor... so that Gandalf can gank him and swipe it while keeping all the "blame" on Sauron (see below for why "blame" is quoted... recall that history is written by the victors!).<br/><br/><b>Every race other than Elves was created by Sauron (or other Maiar) in the previous age, not just orcs.</b><br/> - Cuts right to the racial divide: it's not Good versus Evil, it's the newest creations trying to do what older creations did: expand and be fruitful. The Dwarves retreated and were eventually ruined; Hobbits (an earlier race) made their peace by accepting serious reproduction controls; Man... well, hell, they've gone bonkers and are spooging babies all over Middle Earth, they're a frigging *cancer* in the other races' eyes (especially the orcs, being a race that is routinely and summarily executed whenever Men find one of their colonies).<br/><br/><b>The Race of Men are predominately ignorant, racist, homocidal morons; the handful of "wise, noble" Men we see in the Trilogy have had extensive PR "massaging" of their records by Elves.</b><br/> - It's probably true in the backstory anyway, and it fits with the one above well. And I like the idea of Elves sort of "revising" the History of the War of the Rings to make their hick allies more appealing (presumably so the Valar won't laugh them out of The West for hitching their horse to Men in the War). And what's that make the Elves?<br/>...Utterly distant, uncaring participants in a "game" played in Middle Earth (as mentioned earlier). In fact... you could treat this as a LOTR meets Matrix Reboot! That would cover the "magic is tech" thing, too--the Elves and Maiar are actually cognizant that it's a game, but would be booted from the system indefinitely, if they ever said as much to any "NPCs". Their "magic" is just Neo-like Matrix code manipulation.<br/><br/>Woah... *fritz sizzle* Head hurting.....<br/><br/>As for system... hell, I dunno. What system do you like to play which has some capability of being setting-hacked? I could do all of the above with anything from <i>Hero System</i> to <i>Universalis</i>.

Kinda like New BSG sucked the fun out of loose women, gambling, violent space battles, clear lines of good and evil, patriarchal society, and big hair-dos. Oh, wait... that's what Darcy asked for here:<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Darcy Burgess</cite>In other words, this is all about doing exactly what was done with BSG (canon characters in a wholly new situation to serve a new artisitic purpose).</blockquote>...and here:<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Darcy Burgess</cite>Faramir wants the throne for himself<br/>Aragorn is some maimed (one-eyed?) crazy freedom fighter.<br/>Arwen is all bitter that she didn't take the boat.</blockquote>See?

I think prime candidates are the role of women, elitism, and militarism.</blockquote>I'd guess so, as you said:<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Darcy Burgess</cite>That thing that James' first (edited) and second post talked about is what I meant.  James articulated it hella-better than me, though.  So, James has his artistic agenda.  I'm not saying I disagree with him, I just don't know if it's mine.</blockquote>Thus, I humbly suggest that my reboot--full of racial tension, skinned with a Matrix-like metaphysics, and exploring how LOTR's "history" could just be pro-human PR--pings all sorts of modern dilemmas, from war to class conflict to MMORPG addiction.<br/><br/>Or is "SquidLord" right, in saying that I've gone off-track by not adhering to THE "reason to use LotR's concepts in the <em>first</em> place?"

Like fanaticism for the cylons. Or the hypocrisy that cyclons made more cyclons to be their slaves but are stil mad about beign enslaved in the distant past. Or the idea that the big bad guys (cyclons) from the old series are the new victims.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So, in that vein, you could have Sauron as the victim. Have his ring effect him the same way Gollom's ring effected him. Add a dash of Last of the Mahicans (Sauron does seem to be the last of his kind) and maybe give him something that huumanizes his character like a love interest or a drinking problem...<br/>\n<br/>\n  And Gandalf as a Pope-like figure calling for a crusade. He is so blinded by his faith in The Order, that he can't consider the fact that their agenda might be misguided or even wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sam is an enabler, and Frodo the abuser (not necessarily abusing Sam, but some sort of self-destructive tendencies). Maybe Frodo is a thrill seeker and before the fellowship is formed he used to do extreme sports and other dangerous activities. There has to be a reason why he has a death wish, maybe he was the sole survivor of an Orc raid or house fire and feels that he shouldn't have been the one that lived...<br/>\n<br/>\n  I can prolly come up with more, is that the kind of thing you had in mind?<br/>\nDave M<br/>\nAuthor of Legends of Lanasia (Still in Beta)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_119137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119137/#Comment_119137" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-11T10:31:22+00:00" title="January 11, 2008 10:31AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool ideas, Dave--I like the theme of addiction explored by tweaking the focus on The Ring(s). Better than my own notion of Elves being Matrix-MMORPG addicts.<br/><br/>Got me thinking some more: what if the whole thing was "thugged up," like <i>The Wire</i> meets LOTR? The whole Gondor v Rohan thing smacked of a gang dispute even in the original--two groups with much in common, living in shadow, but determined to fuck with each other until the Capo (Aragorn, or maybe Gandalf) comes along to smack them into shape. I see Elves, then, as sort of the "uptown gang": the corporate hypocrites who put on a show of being noble and fair, but are just as big (or bigger) junkies for magic and The Ring(s) as any poor Hobbit.<br/><br/>Hehe... speaking of Hobbits: they could totally stand in as, like, junkie schoolkids on the block, being pushed around by the bigger kids' gangs and made to "take a taste" of the junk, so they HAVE to come along when the posse rolls out on them damned East Side Orcz!

To combine it with some of the ideas mentioned earlier, you could get a story where Sauron was originally a likeable character. However, he was the runt of the pack. When someone screwed up with the One Ring (maybe it WAS him, maybe someone else), making an extremely powerful but flawed and dangerous object, the powers that be foisted it off on him. You know, like an experimental subject. Oh, and then they kicked him out of Eden.<br/><br/>Since then, the powers that be have been spreading propaganda about how bad he is and motivating all the races against him.

Gandalf cursed Sauron and all his followers, turning what was once the most beautiful race in Middle Earth into a vast horde of orcs and hobgoblins and blamed everything on them. But Sauron escaped and has been calling out to the ring in order to break the spell and free Middle Earth from the clutches of evil.<br/><br/>The Fellowship, its all part of Gandalf's plan. He knows if he takes the ring, Sauron will be able to control him and remove the spell. That's why he wants the little, stealthy hobbits to do it for him.

And they find it has been totally fucked up because nobody was paying attention to what was going on back home.  Everything they loved about the Shire is almost completely wrecked.  There are spies, secret police, jails, harsh taxes, the works.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd there's a guardsman who is like, "Hey, stop: you guys can't do all this stuff, by order of The Boss."  And you know what Merry and Pippin say?  "STFU n00b!" is what they say.  And then the little dinky Hobbits tear the joint <i>up</i>.  Within half a day, four Hobbits have out-smarted, out-fought, and out-moralized one of Gandalf's peers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey didn't go through all that suffering just to watch as everything they loved got taken over by The System.

Sort of LOTR meets Game of Thrones.<br/><br/>This kind of fits my original thought to Darcy's post, which is that you could run this with Sorcerer, with the One Ring being a big-ass Immanent Demon that wants everybody to fight and kill each other.

He guarded the lands from harm until the traitor Gandalf and Elrond invaded his lands and stole his source of power. Gandalf cursed Sauron and all his followers, turning what was once the most beautiful race in Middle Earth into a vast horde of orcs and hobgoblins and blamed everything on them. But Sauron escaped and has been calling out to the ring in order to break the spell and free Middle Earth from the clutches of evil.<br/></blockquote>\nAaah!  Sorry, but this is my hugest source of irritation with LotR and all its imitators.  I hate, hate, hate the way that the attractive, charming elves are the angelic good guys of Middle Earth, while the swarthy Men of the East (and even more the bestial Orcs) are obviously evil.   This outraged me even as a kid, to the point where I've never played an Elf character in 25 years of gaming.  <br/><br/>I figure that Orcs look pretty good to other Orcs, and that humans look ridiculously frail and baby-faced to them.  The Orcs we meet in LotR have lousy attitudes in part because they've been fighting a war for survival for generations, and in part because they've been pretty much enslaved by the Wizards, who exploit their warlike tendencies and suppress their good characteristics.  You could underscore this, as the Orc general character Darcy refers to,by having all sides scramble for Orcish mercenary muscle in the aftermath of the War of the Ring.  <br/><br/>Another interesting perspective is brought by this Scandinavian nut -- I can't recall his name -- who suggests that Sauron, with his one eye and black throne and mystic knowledge and association with wolves, is a distorted and debased version of Odin.  By this reading, the LotR is a heavily biased source, as it needs to blacken the names of Sauron, the Witch-King, and the Orcs in order to make its chosen heroes look better.  <br/><br/>The same guy also thinks the Elves are disguised Jews, which is maybe going too far -- although it would explain the scene in Rivendell where Legolas annoys Gimli by boasting of being able to get Mithril at wholesale.  And also why the hobbits eat bitter herbs with their lembas.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_119418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sydney%20Freedberg" title="Sydney Freedberg"><img alt="Sydney Freedberg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sydney%20Freedberg">Sydney Freedberg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119418/#Comment_119418" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-14T10:06:55+00:00" title="January 14, 2008 10:06AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A little late to the party, but I've always wanted to try this from an entirely different angle: Take everything Tolkein wrote straight and then <i>play the bad guys</i>. You're ugly, quarrelsome, and doomed, and on some level you know it, because, hey, every time the bad guys seem to win, the gods (Valar) hit the game-reset button and rearrange the continents under your feet. But, dammit, you're powerful and bitter, so at least you're going to do some damage before you go, and maybe even have some fun along the way.<br/><br/>Two approaches:<br/><br/>Play it as tragedy. The player-characters are among the "nine mortal men doomed to die," the "men and kings of men" granted Rings of Power by Sauron centuries before the time of Frodo. You can wield awesome power, but every time you use it, you fade away a little more until you become a wraith-slave to the Dark Lord. Play with Ron Edward's <i>Sorcerer</i>.<br/><br/>Play it as dark comedy. The War of the Ring is on, the Dark Lord's armies are mustering to crush Gondor and Rohan once and for all, the Nazgul are walking abroad -- and, dammit, why the hell can't all this firepower catch four freakin' midgets who might as well be carrying a damn homing beacon, considering how the One Ring operates? The player-characters are Ring-Wraiths, orc generals, Saruman, and other lieutenants of the Dark Lord: mighty beyond human ken, and yet ultimately just Minions, scrambling and squabling as they try to keep out of trouble with their Master.

It just seemed more like they "retired" after the last battle.<br/><br/>I also sort of disliked missing the Barrow Downs scene and Tom Bombadil's rescue: The former was supposed to be their "first taste" of the dangers of the world--a pale shadow of the threat of the Riders--and the latter was (in my 20-odd readings) a powerful motivational scene, giving the Hobbits an even stronger sense of what they were trying to save ("innocence?" "purity?" "the natural order?") than the placid Shire had given them. Tom and Goldberry are paragons of "Goodness" whereas, even in The Shire, there's some "sin" of pride and gluttony and so forth. (Yes, I am aware that the Tom scene was added to reference a friend's child's teddy bear--doesn't mean Tolkien didn't think about HOW that could be woven into the epic; it's not automatically a "tacked on" scene!)<br/><br/>But both hit the cutting room floor, even though (I feel) they could have been handled in about ten to fifteen minutes of screen time. Another ten or so for the Hobbits' Return, and we've got a mere, oh, thirty minutes added onto the 12 hours. Big whoop. But it would have meant at least two more locations (and probably two sound stage locations: in the Barrows and in Tom's house).<br/><br/>But even lacking those (to me) key scenes, the Trilogy is still 9.5 out of 10! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_119461">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119461/#Comment_119461" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-14T12:22:34+00:00" title="January 14, 2008 12:22PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James_Nostack</cite>Rather than doing a reboot, it might be fun to do the "impossible" sequel, decades or centuries later as everything these people fought for gets taken away and destroyed by pettiness, greed, sloth, ignorance, and good intentions.</blockquote>\nBlink.<br/><br/>Yeah, as a matter of fact, that could be the quite good.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_119469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119469/#Comment_119469" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-14T12:39:04+00:00" title="January 14, 2008 12:39PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ugh, Tom Bombadil.<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, okay, for a reboot - Tom Bombadil conquers the Earth and everyone has to fight the bastard... <i>with SONGS</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_119475">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119475/#Comment_119475" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-14T12:49:02+00:00" title="January 14, 2008 12:49PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For all the "Sauron is good, Gandalf is bad" claptrap that would be pretty one-dimensional and not fun (in my book, your book is different, whatever) one element of it resonates with me, mainly because it's something that comes up in BSG a lot:<br><br>No one is evil in their own mind.

It's actually pretty much an expansion of what Tolkien started in the first place.<br/><br/>Tony's "Everyone knows it's a doomed quest, <i>but</i>" scenario. Seems like Poison'd would indeed work well for it. A couple of questions: first, it seemed like this would be a particularly short-lived game. The situation, with everyone traveling together and wanting <i>the same Thing</i> can't possibly stand for long. I suppose the situation could change into an entirely new situation* (that's what the Breaking of the Fellowship is, after all), but I'm not sure what that would look like. How do you see this playing out?<br/><br/>And second, how is Aragorn's perspective/plan in this scenario different from Boromir's? They both look like "It'll work for me, I won't be corrupted, I must wield it For Great Justice!" to me.<br/><br/><b>My idea:</b> riffing off the Scouring of the Shire (whose omission is, YES, the greatest of Jackson's many crimes), the Heroes of the Ring aren't adjusting well to quiet old charming Shire-living. They spent a year becoming the baddest motherfuckers West of the Brandywine and with the Big Men all booted and the unrest quelled they don't know what to do with themselves. And the complacent Shirefolk don't know what to do with their queerminded and wizard-touched prodigals.<br/><br/>Or IS all well with the Shire? Merry's pretty sure the Big Men brought in by Sharky are regrouping and looking to move in on the hobbits again, and he's leaving no stone unturned across the Four Farthings looking to root out Sharky operations and their Hobbit colluders. Sam as Hobbiton mayor is pressured by his constituents to do something about the rabblerouser, which means his good friend in the Lockholes. He's undecided and miserable, wanting most to go stomping about with Merry himself but bound by his family obligations and community status. He may snap someday--he already doubles as town Shirriff just to take out his aggression. Meanwhile Pippin is also come into authority as Thain of Tookland, but he wants none of it--instead he's become a debauched roustabout, given to drink, sowing oats with abandon, and picking fights in a desperate attempt to regain that Battle of the Last Alliance thrill ("I Shlew a troll! A Great black troll, I tell y'! My blade right in hish guts like hyah!"). Sooner or later either Sam or Merry'll have to have it out with him. And as for Frodo. . .he wants noting to do with any of it. . .or anything. He sacrificed all for this peaceful haven, and can't even enjoy it in his heartsickness. . .or enjoy his bosom friends in their adventure-lust. He just wants the fighting to end. . .and his best pals are doing all the fighting. He may try to end it all, one way or another. His friends worry about him, and everyone else murmurs about the mad Elf-friend of Bag End. . .<br/><br/>Play with PTA, of course. [EDIT: Or <i>Best Friends</i>, duh!]<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel<br/><br/>*side note: I wonder if that's not at the root of many folks' problems with the new BSG? It's built on a situation that's unstable, that <i>cannot</i> stand, that simply must change into a new situation. So it does, but then <i>that</i> situation is unstable, and morphs into yet another situation. I think this is awesome, both in theory and in BSG's practice-but it absolutely requires audience buy-in for each and every situation to remain cool. I certainly remember plenty of shows who switched up situation on me and I hated them for it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121662">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121662/#Comment_121662" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-24T07:47:12+00:00" title="January 24, 2008  7:47AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Melinglor</cite>My idea</blockquote>...ROCKS!

It's actually got me wanting to play this or write it or <i>some</i>thing. My wife said this about it: "It's cool because everyone wants incompatible things and is a source of each other's pain, even though they're best friends." (Which is, of course, exactly when I realized it could be run with Best Friends!) My brother, though, liked it but also pointed out that it's not a reboot, <i>really.</i> Oops. I did come by it by thinking "BSG-style" about the situation though, so nyah!.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
