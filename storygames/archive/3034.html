It goes like this: (1) frame a scene, (2) roleplay to conflict, (3) engage mechanics to resolve conflict, (4) narrate resolution of conflict.  There is never more than one conflict per scene.<br/><br/>These games usually have a <strong>fixed budget of adversity</strong> available to the GM/Producer/Antagonist/Whatever, so there are really only X number of conflicts that can have meaningful adversity, and since there is one scene per conflict*, this budget becomes something of a game timer.  When budget is expended, the session is over.<br/><br/>*Yes, sometimes there are non-conflict scenes.  In my experience this does not make budget not a game timer.<br/><br/>This also tends to make (but hardly guarantees) that <strong>each scene is "about" one thing</strong>, typified by the one conflict.  I would say this effect works about 70% of the time, and is <em>highly</em> dependent on player skill to frame and find a meaningful conflict that expresses the main thrust of the scene.<br/><br/>Because the mechanics are engaged so sparingly, the dice or card mechanics become <strong>highly erratic</strong>.  It is quite possible, even likely, to get an 'improbable' result, and since there are no more conflicts, there are no additional rolls or whatever to mitigate the occasional outlier.  This results in play that can have some pretty profound and violent swings.  The situation in the fiction can change in a heartbeat.<br/><br/>There are also <strong>no 'follow-up' actions</strong>, and players cannot respond (mechanically) to conflict results in that scene; they must wait until another scene where they can enact a response.  Which can mean that they have to sit on the results, stew a bit, fully experience the consequences, and formulate a really good response for when it's time.  It can also mean that they end up feeling rather deprotagonized.<br/><br/>In most of these games, there is <strong>no other mechanics to ensure that this series of scenes ever stitches together</strong> to create a meaningful narrative.  There is no rising action, there is no climax, there is no denouement.  Each scene, no matter where it lies in the series, is treated in exactly the same fashion.  This again falls to player skill to turn the sequence of scenes into a story, looking at the dwindling budget and saying aloud, "Okay, big finish, everybody!" or something similar.<br/><br/>This is what I see in these one-conflict scene structures.  I'm sure there are more implications that I'm not seeing.  Despite some <em>fantastic</em> play under this structure, I'm not sure if I'm really sold on it.  What do you see, what makes this structure work for you, or what makes this structure not work for you?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

My experience has been that one-conflict scenes (particularly in Shock:) tends to hinder story-level pacing structures.<br/><br/>And maybe I'm expecting something different than you are from a scene: I think that a single conflict shouldn't stand on it's own - it should necessarily depend on what came before and build for what's coming after.  Talking about a denouement every scene seems pretty contrary from my point of view.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C.

So instead:<br/><br/><strong>Narrative Structure:</strong> I think you're missing what I'm talking about, here.  I want rising action, climax, and denouement for the story told in the session, not per scene.  I want, as a rough example, three scenes of rising action, then two scenes of setbacks, then a big epic scene of climax, and one or two scenes of denouement.  Sure, those individual scenes will have little epicycles of rising action and climax (which these games already do well, yes), but I want them to work together to make a much larger structure with a definite (although not necessarily predetermined) shape.<br/><br/><strong>Budget as Timer or Pacing:</strong> See, I wouldn't call budget a pacing mechanic; it's a game timer.  To me, a pacing mechanic would inform the pacing of the game in a mechanical fashion.  It would be something like "When you have five budget left, you do this-and-such."  As they stand, neither <em>PTA</em> nor <em>Shock:</em> do this.  There are 'things that you can do to make your game rock' and exercise player skills to that end, but those are not mechanics, and they are not mentioned in the game texts to my knowledge.  Instead, when budget runs out, you're done -- whether or not the story is done.  If the story is not done by the time budget runs out, <em>you as a player</em> have failed to exercise your player skills effectively.  To me, this feels a lot like the game rules failing the players, especially when the book does not even mention the possibility of this happening.<br/><br/>For instance, <em>PTA</em> has this whole section about Act structure, but it's not linked in to the Budget pool.  If there was an explicit link between the macro structure and the budget pool, budget would be upgraded to a pacing mechanic in my mind.<br/><br/><strong>Follow Up Actions:</strong> I think here we're talking past each other.  There are opportunities to reroll, certainly, but a reroll within the same conflict is different from one conflict happening and then <em>another</em> conflict happening right afterwards. I'm not even talking about dice probabilities, here, I'm talking about <em>how many options I have as a player</em> after dice have been rolled in the scene.  It's a matter of how rigid the scene structure is, and what is allowable within one scene.  If there's a big social throw-down and I come out on the bad end of it, I might want to have my character pull a gun and shoot somebody (maybe not even the guy who beat me down in the social conflict) -- but resolving that conflict is not an option in some of these games -- notably <em>PTA</em>.<br/><br/>I think I should point out, I'm not saying that this structure is necessarily a bad thing; I'm just saying that it exists.  I find it leads to some strict screen-time economy in <em>PTA</em>, for instance, and results in something very much like a television show.  (Where 'pull the gun' is the next scene, after a commercial break or something.)  I found it out of place in <em>Shock:</em>, because in my experience speculative fiction has tons of one-upsmanship, immediate responses to actions, and back-and-forths.  To me, speculative fiction has a lot of immediate escalation, which <em>Shock:</em> does not have a lot of support for.  This bit is, for me, a question of selecting appropriate mechanics for the kind of game you want to participate in.<br/><br/><strong>Granularity:</strong> Again, this is one of those "this is an effect I see, not a criticism I'm making" -- games that make a lot dependent on one die roll (or one die roll and one possible reroll) result in big, sudden, shifts in the fiction.  I find this entirely appropriate for both <em>PTA</em> and <em>Shock:</em>.  It would be out of place if you were trying to reproduce, say, <em>Lord of the Rings</em> which has, like, three big monumental shifts in the entire book series.<br/><br/>(As an aside, I tend to think this should be accompanied with a warning sticker, lest players expect unsurprising results from the mechanics; it can be really disconcerting to realize how fluid the game you're already playing really is.  But that's a very minor issue.)<br/><br/><strong>FitM vs FatE:</strong> (That's Fortune in the Middle, ie rolling dice in the middle of the conflict process, and Fortune at the End, ie rolling dice at the end of the conflict process.)  Joshua, I think this is a red herring, but it's quite possible I'm wrong.  I'm looking at this more in terms of, "What can I do as a player in one scene" and not so much "How do I roll dice."  What do you see that I'm not?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_69302">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69302/#Comment_69302" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-15T12:29:16+00:00" title="May 15, 2007 12:29PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 15, 2007 12:30PM by Remi.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps I'm just missing something, but I can't think of a game that effectively, mechanically, manipulates pacing.

That's why the Producer MUST put down on one side of a stake or another (or come in with a completely different stake) in every conflict. This moderates, to some extent, how things are narrated, and how stakes turn out, because there's always someone with no personal concern as to outcome involved.<br/><br/>All that being said, I'm not sure what we're talking about any more.

It has a Story Arc mechanic that gradually shifts game effectiveness from the GM to the players through the course of the game. Players have to lose conflicts in order to advance the Story Arc.

The thing I want (and I'm only formulating this <em>as I type</em>) is to know where I am in the story <em>as I'm playing it</em>.

Sure, I can do that on my own initiative, but I would prefer to have mechanical support to help me coordinate with the other players; otherwise we are liable to go veering off into incoherence land.

I look at your argument that this doesn't happen, and it does, for me, with startling regularity. Is it useful for me to be in the conversation?</br></br></blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>Dude, hands down it works for you, and I'm not saying otherwise at all.  As I've pointed out: we're in season two of <em>PTA</em> and it's rockin'.  But it doesn't rock solely because of <em>PTA's</em> rules and procedures; it relies heavily on the players' understanding of television and techniques brought from outside <em>PTA</em>.  As examples, we once tried to play <em>PTA</em> with MarkV, who doesn't watch television.  The game fell flat on its face; it was awkward and broken.  The game<em>requires</em>familiarity with television to work, and that familiarity provides a good portion of the narrative structure ("It's about time for a commercial break here.").  Or, as you just typed, "the Producer has his R-map" -- except R-maps are not out of <em>PTA</em>, that's imported from other games.<br><br>And, really, I'm not saying that <em>PTA</em> is, like, BORKEN or anything.  I'm saying that there are other tools that could supplement what's already in <em>PTA</em>, and make it even more awesome than it is.  So like when you say that <em>Dogs</em> is "helped along with more rigidly-defined town creation rules," that's what I'm looking for: more help, more support, a more optimal set of tools to create the gaming experience.</br></br></blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Remi</cite>I would say that R-Maps are strongly implied in PTA, but you are correct, they're brought in from outside. Then again, every game with more than 3 characters needs some sort of R-Mappy thing, so it's just in my technique bag, now. Almost every game works better with an R-Map, and PTA is enhanced especially because of the explicit Nemeses and Connections.<br/><br/>Also, I would say that PTA is VERY explicit about its connection to TV. If someone said, seriously, that they hated TV and everything on it, I would pull out Dogs or something. I don't see that as a failing.<br/><br/>Also, I'd be totally down with putting together a PTA supplement. I've sort of developed a way to speed-create a series, and I definitely have thoughts on how a Producer can best use their influence in the game. Add in R-Maps, and other techniques, and you have a handy little guide to make PTA even better (instead of having a good-but-not-great game).<br/><br/>I'd rather do that than try to sell you on on a game you're already playing :-)</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>Dude, I so want <em>PTA: Revised</em>.  Or <em>the Second Season</em> or whatever.  There are so many awesome techniques and procedures that could be used to supplement that game and make it king-kong super-awesome.</blockquote>\nAnd, to clarify: I don't see <em>PTA's</em> reliance on televion-familiarity a failing; in fact I think it's pretty bloody genius, since that market is pretty freaking HUGE.  As an exemplar of one-conflict scene games, <em>PTA</em> uses television-familiarity to provide larger structure to the fiction because the one-conflict scene game structure does not provide adequate fiction structure.

Some confusion has occurred because I describe 4 "Acts" in the book, but they were meant only as guidelines. <i>*I*</i> never intended them to be used like, "Now we're in Act 3, you have to do X, Y, &amp; Z." I certainly don't play that way. In the book, I specifically call them "informal phases."<br/><br/>I use the "Acts" as GM advice, not player advice, if you get my drift. Actually, I even tailor conflicts for individual players, so like one PC might get Act 2 type conflicts while simultaneously another who is further along in their story might be given Act 3 type conflicts.<br/><br/>A few people misunderstood my intent and DID use them in a "you have to do this sort of thing now" -sense. Luckily, this approach doesn't seem to break the game. I have debated removing the label "Acts" and rewording that section of text to be more obviously GM advice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69641">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69641/#Comment_69641" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-16T09:41:12+00:00" title="May 16, 2007  9:41AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tim, can you elaborate on why you made the Acts thing a guideline rather than a procedure or rule?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70187">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/oliof" title="oliof"><img alt="oliof" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.mausdompteur.de/gravn32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/oliof">oliof</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70187/#Comment_70187" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-18T09:50:16+00:00" title="May 18, 2007  9:50AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Side note on pacing effects in Dogs: When the Dogs first run into the town people in conflicts, the GM thinks up their traits on the spot.

The breakdown is mostly meant to be "you've seen this a zillion times, but here's some labels for it to help discussion."<br/><br/>If the game weren't about TV, I'd definitely want structuring and pacing mechanics in there, and in fact for Galactic I've had to do more of that to make the game work better. A more complex system to replace budget, a checklist series of goals, a feedback loop for what it means to fail, etc, all leading up to the system saying, "okay, now you're done."<br/><br/>So, uh, I dunno, I guess we're kind of in agreement. Right? Except I will never admit to flaws in Primetime Adventures.

I confess, I'm using something akin to this for my Game Duel game MacGuffin; so far I'm pleased with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70448">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson" title="Matt Wilson"><img alt="Matt Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dog-eared-designs.com/img/goaticon2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson">Matt Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70448/#Comment_70448" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-19T08:35:25+00:00" title="May 19, 2007  8:35AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>Does Galactic have one conflict per scene, or a different structure?</blockquote>\nSorta. Except it's more like one conflict per turn. There's three main characters running around the game, and you switch attention after a conflict. Where you pick up on your next turn varies, but it could be a continuation of the same conflict.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
