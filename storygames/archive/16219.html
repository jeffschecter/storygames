So flawless and powerful, a mere capital 'G' doesn't cut it.  But those very qualities that might make a mortal regard you as "perfect" are the same qualities that make you rather be a mortal, with all the melodrama and existential quandries and <i>life</i> that can come with mortality.<br/><br/>At the start of this game, you use your unlimited powers to completely recreate yourself, put limits here and drives there.  This is character creation.  But every instance of change affects your ability to -design- your own recreation.  The more mortal you become, the less able you are to conceive of that essence of mortality that you originally aimed for.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Would designing towards this set up produce a game where a character's goals match up with the goals of fiction authorship?  Or would it inevitably shift back to a forward-advancement system as the character's mortal drives overwhelm the initial set-up?  Or would it instead devolve into a metagame of who can traumatize/kill their character first and worst?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_369813">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369813/#Comment_369813" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-28T16:33:39+00:00" title="March 28, 2012  4:33PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 28, 2012 4:35PM by mease19.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What about you start as all powerful and, as you play, you define the world and your place in it.
