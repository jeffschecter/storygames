To take Itras By as an example, it's kind of prep heavy in this sense, asking the players to come up with plot hooks, secondary characters and motivations/goals for their characters. The GM is encouraged to feed of this pool of inspiration when the game starts for realz. The game asks the players to do "work" before play. Hopefully fun, stimulating and rewarding work, but nevertheless. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409938">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409938/#Comment_409938" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-21T10:47:46+00:00" title="March 21, 2013 10:47AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Every game with character creation?</blockquote>\nI debated explicitly excluding this in the OP, but didn't in case someone had an interesting perspective on it.  It's not every game with character creation, because in a lot of games you do it cooperatively, or at least together.  And a lot of times when it really is player prep, there's not as much of an avenue to present it to the players, unless you just go around the circle and present back story.<br/><br/>But I'm mostly interested in player prep after the first session.\n<blockquote>There are certainly games that make the GM more "responsive."

Universalis is the only thing I've played that doesn't really that this.  It may be a limitation of the role of the GM vs player in such games.  Players just don't have the opportunity to contribute a big chunk of stuff they've created by themselves.\n<blockquote>I really want a game where the players write a deck of cards as prep: places, things, people, challenges, surprises, etc.  Then they show up with their deck, shuffle them together, and hand them to the GM.

Before "play" everyone would do some madlibs, put their answers on cards, which were later used as (suggestion) oracles for round-robin scene framing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409939">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409939/#Comment_409939" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-21T11:07:58+00:00" title="March 21, 2013 11:07AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There was a culture of downtime player activities in the 90s.  Bluebooking and diary writing and stuff.  Much of this came out of the world of larping, where games would reward players with XP for doing stuff out of the game.  "Stuff out of the game" would include making costumes or playing NPCs but also developing your character's plotlines and things.  So in a Vampire game, you would go and conspire during the actual face-to-face larp and then send a GM a note or actual blue book describing what you do between face to face meetings.  The GMs would take those bluebooks and use them as fodder for new plots and things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409941">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409941/#Comment_409941" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-21T11:18:55+00:00" title="March 21, 2013 11:18AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Houses of the Blooded" and "Blood and Honor" might be more up your alley.
