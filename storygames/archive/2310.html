                    Hi all,<br/><br/>I'm working on support material for Crime and Punishment and will shortly be coming up writing some play advice for  playing games set in countries other than Canada and the US. I'm looking for help identifying the titles of law enforcement officials and bureaus within the legal system of your home country.<br/><br/>For example, in Britain I think that a Crime Scene Technician is called a "Scene of the Crimes Officer", an District Attorney is a "Public Prosecutor", and that beat cops are nicknamed "Bobbies". I know that detectives there work in the  "Criminal Investigation Department (CID)" rather than in "Detective Division" or on a "Homocide Squad". I think that "Special Branch" is the general way to refer to what would be the British equivalent of the FBI or the RCMP.I don't know if Coroners are Coroners, there for example, or if there is a distinction between a Coroner and a Medical Examiner as can exist here.<br/><br/>If I'm wrong on any of the above, please do correct me. I'm looking for help on the UK, for sure, and pretty much on as many other places I can get a good grip on. I'm looking for info on the process in general, beat cops, detectives, EMT, crime scene investigation, forensics, district attorneys, justice departments, internal affairs, medical examiners... pretty much the whole kit and kaboodle.                </div>

                            Mo,<br/><br/>I'll check this with my girlfriend, who's training to be a barrister, but...<br/><br/>- Scenes of Crime Officer, not Scene of the Crimes Officer.<br/>- The direct equivalent of the District Attorney would be Director of Public Prosecutions, but what you really want is the Crown Prosecution Service.<br/>- Bobbies is very old fashioned slang. Cops, perhaps.<br/>- Yes, CID.<br/>- Special Branch deals with national security, but isn't really the FBI. There's no direct equivalent of the FBI, I believe.<br/>- Coroners are Coroners.<br/>- The government department of interest is the Home Office, which oversees prisons, the police, courts, etc, etc.<br/><br/>I'm sure someone who knows more about this will correct me shortly, but there's a start.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            Isn't this complicated by the fact that, in the US, there are varying terms for all of these by municipality, and state? Heck, in some places SWAT teams are called other things than that (that title having been popularized by a TV show, just like CSI has been). Aren't people going to have to simply look up the correct names for the municipality in which they're supposedly playing? Or, if it's fictional, just pick ones?<br/>
<br/>
What's the scope on naming these things?<br/>

                            Mike, <br><br>Good question, and one I wrestled with, but in the end it came down to basing the common parlance of Crime and Punishment  on the procedural crime drama genre rather than on what's necessarily true. Considering that one of the kinds of procedural dramas you can play in C&amp;P are Forensics Investigation Units, not, for example Crime Scene Division which don't do such things as interview suspects, some liberty to abandon the truth is pretty necessary. While it's true that people are free to lookup specifics about a particular locality, Crime and Punishment is meant to be entirely no-prep, and so I wanted some support material in the book to provide enough colour for people to be able to play *now*.<br/><br/>Plus, as a Canadian, I'm sensitive to the idea of providing, even in small ways, play alternatives that can help make any media less American-centric. That's particularly tough to do in a genre like this. So I'm providing some information in differences of law and lingo in different places, and including some insta-play settings in different locales, along with the New York, Chicago, Los Angeles triad of American procedural drama on television and in fiction.                        </br></br></div>

                            Mo, you whispered to me asking about TV series to give you a feel for British policing.<br/><br/>I'd suggest...<br/><br/>1. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bill-Complete-2-Nula-Conwell/dp/B000AYQJOW/sr=8-1/qid=1170354335/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-9437843-2728839?ie=UTF8&amp;s=dvd" rel="nofollow">The Bill.</a>. These days, it's a bit of a soap opera, although it used to be much more gritty. But it does have the cops in uniform, doing their thing, and you'd get an idea of the procedural stuff.<br/><br/>2. Prime Suspect's worth a look and widely available. Not police in uniform, though.<br/><br/>3. Cracker's worth a look too. And widely available. And not police in uniform.<br/><br/>4. If you can possibly get hold of BBC's series The Cops, that's gritty stuff. A fantastic series. Hard to get hold of, though.<br/><br/>5. Doctor Who is worth a look. It's nothing to do with the police, it's just great.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>
