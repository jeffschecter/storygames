Could you tell us more about your booth-renting programme?<br/><br/>So far, Keith has said:\n<blockquote>A full membership for a year is $75. This past Gen Con, a half booth was $375 and a display in the GPA Showcase was $150. The Showcase doesn't even require you to be on site. Most of the participants often just ship the product in and the GPA sells it for them. The participating company gets all the proceeds, minus 10% for each Credit Card transaction. So, even if you can't be at GenCon, you product can be.<br/><br/>The GPA does this not just with GenCon, but also with Origins and Gama Trade Show. The advantage is that the GPA is able to negotiate as a group to get advantagous postioning on the dealer floor, and usually a bit of a discount to the booth fees. The Showcase isn't conducted at GTS, since it is an industry show, the point is to make contact with sellers, and not actually sell product.</blockquote>\nThis sounds like a phenomenally good offer. Did people take advantage of it this year? Who were they? Where was the GPA Showcase (I don't remember seeing it)? Why isn't everyone doing this, since it gives a huge saving on the booth? <br/><br/>And what does a half-booth give me? Can I choose who I share with? Does my game appear under the GPA banner or under mine? Does my company name appear in the show programme?<br/><br/>This is fascinating. Do tell us more.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286363">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears" title="Keith Sears"><img alt="Keith Sears" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/898/nD5UFQZP7YUY6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears">Keith Sears</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286363/#Comment_286363" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-14T21:32:42+00:00" title="August 14, 2010  9:32PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here is the lineup of the GPA members and the booths they were in for GenCon 2010:<br/><br/>531 - Gut Bustin' Games <br/>530 - Tabletop Adventures (TTA) sharing with Expeditious Retreat Press (XRP) <br/>535 - Hero Games <br/>533 - Game Publishers Association (GPA) sharing with Interaction Point Games <br/>532 - Heliograph Inc. <br/>526/528 - Gorilla Games <br/><br/>A half-booth gives you a dealer badge.

I actually had to go to the GPA guidelines for this one.You can find the FAQ at <a href="http://www.thegpa.org/index.php?name=FAQ&amp;id_cat=1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.thegpa.org/index.php?name=FAQ&amp;id_cat=1</a>. A collective would actually fall outside of the guidelines for General Membership, since they are not an actual publisher or manufacturer. The collective would qualify for Associate membership. However, since each Indy designer is actually a publisher/manufacturer, each individual member of the collective would qualify for General Membership.<br/><br/>It is something that the Board of Directors would need to mull over. The collectives are pretty much like how the GPA first started out and are like mini trade associations.

Either (a.) we're all members of the GPA, or (b.) Cascadian Freeform is an Associate Member. We have a single cash register, a single booth branding, but are actually 4 designers banding together. At any given time, two of us are manning the GPA-associated booth.<br/><br/>If we could do that, under either the (a.) or (b.) clause, then that's really cool and I will be very seriously considering it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_286555">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears" title="Keith Sears"><img alt="Keith Sears" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/898/nD5UFQZP7YUY6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears">Keith Sears</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286555/#Comment_286555" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-15T18:54:00+00:00" title="August 15, 2010  6:54PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

Larger booths at GenCon don't provide the discount they did before. The only reason we've been able to provide something of a discount is by paying the money up front during the Early Bird price period. There were some of the members this year that didn't see the advantage of being in the GPA area and simply got their own booths.<br/><br/>The GPA has never aggressively gone after new companies. We provide information when asked, like now. Personally, knowing the nature of gamers and entrepeneurs, it would actually run counter to our goals by going on aggressive membership drives. Both tend to be very independent and somewhat suspicious of someone trying to sell them something. So we let them come to us.<br/><br/>Indy publishers tend to have a wide variety of motives for publishing. Some are doing it for Art's sake. Others just like sharing ideas and getting together with their fellow publishers/designers. Some are in it because they want to run their own business and they like the gaming industry. If you want to run a business, then the GPA would be an advantage. Not just for the booth benefits.. but mostly because you are able to get advice from industry professionals that can save you a heck of a lot of money.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears" title="Keith Sears"><img alt="Keith Sears" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/898/nD5UFQZP7YUY6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears">Keith Sears</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286559/#Comment_286559" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-15T19:03:19+00:00" title="August 15, 2010  7:03PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mcdaldno</cite>Let's say: me and three other indie designers want to create a label called Cascadian Freeform, and buy a single booth space with the GPA to sell our stuff in.

All three of you would need to be General Members. Associate members aren't able to get involved in the booth sharing.

It's all in our best interests to work together.<br/><br/>In fact, let me tell you about a little program we have. Associate members can join for only $35 for the year. This gives you access to most of the website along with the GPA-L mailing list. Talk with the members.. ask questions.. get to know us. When you decide its time to become a General Member, then you can use the Upgrade option in our system. For only $40, an Upgrade will give you General Membership for a full year. It would be possible to wait until almost the last day of your Associate Membership, use the Upgrade, and become a General Member for another year at a discounted price.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
