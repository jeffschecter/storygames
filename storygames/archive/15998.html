If it's the former, then I have to say that I don't care for it. I've appreciated heteropractical literary style in the past (<i>kill puppies for satan</i> comes to mind), but the typos and whatnot here make the text more difficult to read than it needs to be. If it's intentional, it should be toned down and made more uniform, so it's a stylistic flavour on the text and not a dominant thing. Clear chaptering and a logical order of text flow are paramount to clarity.<br/><br/>As for the underlying style, it's not a problem - that sort of thing can be good if done well. I'd say that the strength of conversational style is that it's more entertaining to read, and it encourages the reader to discard excess legalism and try to understand the procedures described. It works well for readers who are already experienced roleplayers, and for games that are not intended as reference sources, but as something you read and learn in advance of play.<br/><br/>Vincent Baker is a strikingly compelling game text author who writes in this mode most of the time. Dogs in the Vineyard, for example, owes much of its popularity to the clarity of the text, which is mostly gained by informal, effortless style and frank discussion of the procedures of play. His game <i>In a Wicked Age</i> is a good example of the pitfalls of the style: it's notoriously confusing in the way it jumps between rules text and play description that actually conceals a part of the procedures within.<br/><br/>Hmm, I managed to cite three of Vincent's games there. Another work that comes to mind concerning informal game text writing is <i>Vornheim</i>, it has that same "I am a specific human being writing to you, not a paid scribe with a word quota to fill" going on. Works really well for me as a reader, I enjoy reading that sort of thing.<br/><br/>All in all, I guess that I'm pretty much in favour of this. My own style is usually rather informal as well. If I had to pinpoint a danger to it aside from the hazard of confusing organization, I'd have to say that you can't be a poseur with this style. It's a death to the feel of the work if the reader starts thinking that you're being forced about your style. You see this sometimes with game texts that have a real hard-on about say punk culture or other such colorful things. The author lavishes his text with the subculture, so that it's not informal, but merely stilted in a weird direction. The sample text we have here suffers from this slightly, a good editor would tone it down so it doesn't seem that the author is adding excess adjectives just for the sake of emphasizing how informal he's being.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364384">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364384/#Comment_364384" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-01T17:42:28+00:00" title="March  1, 2012  5:42PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 1, 2012 5:51PM by Zak S.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>she</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364403/#Comment_364403" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-01T18:42:04+00:00" title="March  1, 2012  6:42PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My computer says it's 21 pages if printed out, which is enough space for a lot of indie game rules.  <br/><br/>I think there's always been a tradition of informally-written game rules, going as far back as Over the Edge that I can think of, probably further.

Poor grammar and editing is only really a problem in this context if it makes it hard to understand what's written, and I didn't have any trouble with that. I do like the "introduction": it's evocative and very quick to get to the point. I could see using that first paragraph or two as a very dense sourcebook of various play material. Kind of like an "oracle" (in the sense used in In a Wicked Age...). <br/><br/>For example, I can pick a random snippet: "the school mates not returning to class and noone notices". There's a great idea for a "scenario", or at least how it begins, and there's lots of really great ones in that paragraph (or whatever you want to call it: the first block of text). So I like the introduction. Lots of good stuff there!<br/><br/>What I really *don't* like is the editing/formatting. It's really, really hard to look through the text and see where the information is. Some headings, or at least consistency in spacing and where ALL CAPS is used, would really help me read this without getting a headache. <br/><br/>The actual presentation of the game is good in principle: it reminds me very much of Apocalypse World. You've got a brief evocative introduction (with very little actual information, so you fill it in yourself), and then the rest is basically character creation material. Some of the "moves" and powers and what-not are very cool, some not so interesting to me, but overall it seems like it would be easy to find something you can get excited about (like the "freezy beams!").<br/><br/>The rules are very hard to understand (for example, I have absolutely no idea how damage works after having read this text, but I *do* get the impression that damage is really, really important in this game, because it's mentioned all the time). However, since this seems to be a "hack" of Feng Shui, rather than its own game, I have to assume that maybe all that would make sense if I was familiar with the game.<br/><br/>My main reaction to the text other than that is that a lot of the cool-sounding stuff I read in the introduction (like the mermaid returning your call and the black castle hanging above Tokyo, and stealing boyfriends and all that good stuff) doesn't seem represented in the rules. Most of the text seems to be talking about guns and fire blasts and super armor and how much damage they do (with a very few exceptions). So, I would know how to play this game with lots of fighting and killing and power blasts and detachable heads, but what I really found interesting about the game was the "and everyone goes to your concert and the teacher doesn't flunk you" bits, because those seem like they would create a really neat kind of contrast to all the blood and bullets and weird plasma magic and freezy beams.<br/><br/>So I'd be worried about it just being a fighting game without much focus. But if the game is more about the contrast between the weird fighty stuff and the slightly creepy real-world stuff, then I'm quite interested! <br/><br/>Overall, I see this text as very similar to Apocalypse World in style (as with AW, I find myself wanting to write in that same style after reading through it), except that it:<br/><br/>a) Clearly lacks polish (I could be convinced that the bad grammar and spelling is an intentional effect--nothing wrong with that, necessarily--but other things about the text make me suspect that this is just a first draft and not a carefully put-together piece of work, such as the organization of the contents), and<br/>b) doesn't actually tell you how to play the game. (The most unfortunate part, for me.)<br/><br/>There's some great imagery in there, though, maybe enough to convince me to give playing in a genre-that's-more-or-less-the-opposite-of-what-I-usually-like a shot!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364760">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364760/#Comment_364760" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-02T21:54:27+00:00" title="March  2, 2012  9:54PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: scrapprincess</cite>fuck it lets just let the <b>stimulation mechanics</b> run the show for a bit</blockquote>\nHey, now we're talking!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364761/#Comment_364761" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-02T22:00:11+00:00" title="March  2, 2012 10:00PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This game is straight up my alley.

I don't know what my character wants to do , she's just getting by (cool, says I, do you reckon maybe she's lonely and misunderstood, and thus prone to hanging out with fellow weirdos/p.c?)<br/>\nso that's one p.c and already I have a lot to go on.<br/>\n<br/>\nb)So hopefully after character creation, the p.c s like their characters and can see them doing stuff in the world and shit. Give a location (The opening of the new subway train), ask what the hell everyone is doing there. (catching the train, pick pockets, talking to rats, taking lab samples..blah blah), have something go wrong that's ridiculous, ie pink bouncy puffball mushroom people come bouncing up the tunnel, making everyone but the p.cs hallucinate wildly in a comedic fashion.<br/>\nHave a bunch of absurd encounters, something preventing the p.cs from leaving (unless they have a good idea on how to leave) , peoples characters respond in different ways, hopefully they start working together because they are the only ones not tripping balls. <br/>\nAll the civilians are doing silly stuff, like pretending to be pigs, humping the non moving train, p.c have nearly got things under control/ are almost approaching bored, when ghouls come pouring up from the tunnel, because that's what the sporeballs were running from. Ghouls start massacring hallucinating people. Describe blood, babies getting eaten etc. Big fight, make the p.c aware of the constant threat of civilian casualty's (they may or may not care. What ever. I'll roll with it). Fight ends, p.cs win, flee, die,  get lost in tunnels , or what have you. If players are returning to surface, ask them what are they doing now,<br/>\nask lots of questions to ground them in the real life blah blah, So "are you guys gonna split up and go home separately?"  "whos catching the subway home?" "carpooling?" etc. Then when it gets mundane have some kind of crazy ghoul cult attack them. maybe at a house , where a couple of p.cs are hanging out, maybe on the bus, whatever, should somehow be where all the p.cs can respond to it and get their quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter that fight settles down,  I would sit back and see what the characters wanna do and react to that. if they wanna explore the the tunnels (hmm..), track down the ghoul cult, whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nC) so I'm loosing my change of thought here, but yeah asking questions of the p.cs , making them grounded in the setting, take anything ridiculous seriously, and take anything serious ridiculously, and whenever it slows down , have something explode, summon dinosaurs, turn off the gravity. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat's how I would do it as d.m, because I don't know how else to do it. I'm really interest how people would suggest using mechanics to backup the non-fighting aspects to the world. Because for me , I would rely on how I describe things, helping the p.c s imagine how their character fits in the world, and keep a finger firmly on the pulse of the flow of the game. And setup situations that could be hella fun just roleplaying the characters.Like a high school ball, having to play tour guide for demons, scavenger hunts etc. And having a sudden change of pace when ever people got vague. <br/>\nHow would people go about reinforcing this with mechanics?

How much do you think it's necessary?</blockquote>\nI don't think it's necessary.<br/><br/>One neat possibility, though. Give players something like fate points, and let them spend them to escalate / de-escalate situations.<br/><br/>Example 1. they're at work and brain eating lizards start invading earth. However, they were just flirting with their cute coworker, and a lizard invasion can really put crimp in that! So the player spends a fate point to de-escalate and declares that the question isn't if they can prevent the invasion or not, but if they can do it without freaking the coworker out.<br/><br/>Example 2. they're in their favorite cafe, and oops, out of cash when it comes time to settle the bill. They also know ghosts of unborn babies have been restless recently, and are wondering if they should be doing something about it. The player spends a fate point to escalate and says that with all those babyghosts around they're liable to possess someone in the cafe -- rendering the stupid bill moot.<br/><br/>If I was doing this, I'd make those points precious as hell, though. Maybe give each player two to start with, and be pretty pinchy about giving more of them.<br/><br/>(I'm sure others here will have suggestions involving more fast-flowing point economies, and I've nothing against them, but whenever I've done something like this I've found that scarce points are easier to give real oomph to, and interfere less with the simmy engine.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/scrapprincess" title="scrapprincess"><img alt="scrapprincess" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/scrapprincess">scrapprincess</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364798/#Comment_364798" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-03T02:36:44+00:00" title="March  3, 2012  2:36AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nikodemus, I like that escalation/de-escalation  thing a lot. hmmm, thinking about how a meta skill like this, if it would encourage players to be looking down on the game as a whole and viewing it like hey lets make a crazy cartoon happen, when maybe I'm wanting them to feel immersed in the character and to identify with how the character sees the world.

Narrative control tends to conflict with immersion for many people -- especially if the points keep flowing back and forth. However, if the points are a super-scarce resource, the it doesn't tend to disrupt things so much. (Eg. if everyone has two fate points, and as far as they know they're never going to get any more.)<br/><br/>Another twist on the theme: if you foresee that not everyone is going to be present in every scene, you could allow only those whose characters are not present to escalate/de-escalate. :P<br/><br/>Or you could just play it by the ear: lizards invade! If the character focuses on keeping the coworker oblivious, then you as the GM can just de-escalate to that level. ...or maybe just the opposite: if the character's first response to a crises is to try to keep a facade of normality, they can -- but the situation is more likely to spiral out of control otherwise. If the first response is to try to deal with the crises and bystanders be damned, then the crises will be controlled but mundane repercussions will be greater.<br/><br/>(Just thinking out loud.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364838">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364838/#Comment_364838" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-03T09:29:24+00:00" title="March  3, 2012  9:29AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 3, 2012 9:30AM by Zak S.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: nikodemus</cite>Narrative control tends to conflict with immersion for many people -- especially if the points keep flowing back and forth. )</blockquote>\nYeah, I tend to think in this game you'dbe trying so hard to get into Sailor Meth's mindset and say insane things about How Dare You Betray The Trust of The Sisterhood Of Twelve Moons With Your Revolving Rudeness Spheres? that stepping back and playing Author (or trying to find a group of players who wanted to do both) would be contra the necessary mayhem.<br/><br/>I mean, it could happen, but I'm not sure you'd want to provide a mechanical necessity so much as an option.<br/><br/>Plus too much storycontrol in a completely mayhem game and every game might start to fell the same.

Use some changes in the way the rules work to reinforce the difference between the everyday/serious and the mayhem and insanity. Maybe when you're fighting monsters, you get to use your highly competent skills, but when you want to ask that boy out for the school dance, suddenly your abilities are useless, your rolls are only one-half as effective, etc. <br/><br/>Maybe in "mayhem" moments, unusual results (like doubles on the dice) bring about bizarre complications, or cause people to trip out and hallucinate?<br/><br/>Or maybe all this varies character-by-character. You can choose to have a character who is competent in the "real world", tends to get their way, can hold down a good job, whatever, but is completely useless when it comes to dealing with the baby-eating ghouls, because it freaks her out... or you can have the monster-hunter character who has amazing magical abilities and is terrifying when she fights bizarre creatures, but everything in "real life" tends to fall apart, fall completely out of control.<br/><br/>There are many ways to approach this. <br/><br/>The basic idea you have about identifying each character's "normal life", whatever that may be, is a great start. I think it would be fun to, for example, invent threats that interact with every character's "home space". Maybe those ghouls who are invading the subway (where "A", a homeless bum character lives) were created at the Hogwarts-like school where "B" studies, and the headmaster of this school is actually character "C's" dad in disguise. The characters are then thrown into a big mess that inevitably leads them all to meet up again and again as they try to figure out what's actually going on.<br/><br/>You could do it in a much more thematic/psychedelic way, too. Maybe the Hogwarts school is a surreal mirror of character "C's" home family life, so when that character breaks her little brother's skateboard, a magical contraption at the School explodes, destroying a city block. Or maybe both characters occasionally smell lavender for no explicable reason (for a more psychedelic vibe).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364928">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364928/#Comment_364928" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-03T15:41:45+00:00" title="March  3, 2012  3:41PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Marshall Burns</cite>With regard to the content:<br/>I'm not into the magical girl thingy.

I think it would be fun to, for example, invent threats that interact with every character's "home space". Maybe those ghouls who are invading the subway (where "A", a homeless bum character lives) were created at the Hogwarts-like school where "B" studies, and the headmaster of this school is actually character "C's" dad in disguise. The characters are then thrown into a big mess that inevitably leads them all to meet up again and again as they try to figure out what's actually going on.<br/><br/>You could do it in a much more thematic/psychedelic way, too. Maybe the Hogwarts school is a surreal mirror of character "C's" home family life, so when that character breaks her little brother's skateboard, a magical contraption at the School explodes, destroying a city block. Or maybe both characters occasionally smell lavender for no explicable reason (for a more psychedelic vibe).<br/><br/>I'm loving this, will definitely use it in some form , say in addition to feng shuis "melodramatic hook", have the players choose some kind of "social sphere". Need a good name/defintion for it. Maybe I'll just use it as guiding concept for a couple of games, and see if I  can/need to get a better handle on it  , and then name and cement in on (if need be).<br/><br/>A good chunk of the archetypes (Rising Star, Scheming Deliquient , Intrepid Reporter , Teen Sleuth, and Daring Thief)  are the more be able to deal with real world shit types, but  because you get to choose a niche and chaser as well gives you the option of having back up abilitys if you want them. <br/><br/>Nikidemus; I think I'm going to try all of these suggests, and see what works. Because they are all good. Keep thinking aloud. This is gold.<br/><br/>Also, LADYS OF LACEY RAGE: The Monsterfightinging is not entirely based on Sailor Moon. I just keep referencing Sailor Moon because I loved it so much growing up. Also using Jem and The holograms (and secretly Jizz) and Josie and the Pussycats and She-ra and the like.<br/>Really wanna run a Jem and the hologram plot, ripped straight from an episode, because I think it would be a comedy meth lab, having the rival band try and burn down the characters orphanage or cut the brakes on their sweet Roadster, and watch the P.cs take the moral high ground, and win the battle of the bands contest, and show the misfits that cheaters never prosper. <br/>No, I kid,<br/> There would be ruin, bloody, bloody ruin...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364991">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364991/#Comment_364991" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-04T00:33:33+00:00" title="March  4, 2012 12:33AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I found it almost unreadable.

It wasn't *anything* like what you're outlining, really, but had some broad similarities in way of weird shit --&gt; gonzo action --&gt; mundane stuff --&gt; gonzo action --&gt; relationships --&gt; gonzo action...<br/><br/>So, notes based on that. Not sure how applicable they are:<br/><br/>- I ran a SoTC-style character creation, where everyone specified a previous adventure (in Arcadia!) they had been involved in, and then their role in two other characters prior adventures. This worked great to establish both the common ground for characters, and a common understanding of what sort of things their characters would consider normal.<br/><br/>- We had a ton of fun with characters relationship to pop culture. Our Arcadia got plenty of magazines and books from Earth, and the occasional live performer, but no technology could cross the barrier. So characters loved Buffy and Angel *books* but sort of thought thy were actual people. While much of the fun was in their confusion, I'm pretty sure just the character &lt;--&gt; pop culture connection was golden in itself. I'm very much going to try to do something similar in another game.<br/><br/>- Because I wanted to keep the weirdness and mundanity sort of connected, every single NPC in the game had a "weird" hook. It might not come up, but it allowed me to introduce weirdness through them, and it allowed me insert them at least peripherally into the gonzo action much more easily. Stuff like "Next door neighbor is a retired mecha pilot from parallel dimension."<br/><br/>- Characters had really wild fairy magics that I let them do almost anything with, but they were heavily constrained by the amount of glamour they had. Glamour was gained by acting like a fairy of their type should. Players could award glamour to each other, but they often forgot, so in the end I kept handing it out.<br/><br/>- I totally gimped the characters sometimes, except I didn't. "You're captured in a Burmese Fairy Trap! You can't get out!" The trap was a wooden mask, but as soon as playing just a mask that talks got boring (muffled noise coming from a briefcase...) I let him transform into a small wooden animal: the character was a shapeshifter.<br/><br/>- Lots and lots of coincidences and small mysteries they could engage with, or shrug at and ignore. Who broke into their apartment and stole their Angel DVDs, but left Buffy, the TV, and DVD player, etc? Then when they're engaged with X, let Y intrude by force.<br/><br/>- Having an idea of all the background stuff, but very much listening to characters speculate -- and changing stuff to match their interpretation at least some of the time. Otherwise the stuff that's wild enough is just too strange to figure out unless you're a mind reader...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_367067">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/scrapprincess" title="scrapprincess"><img alt="scrapprincess" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/scrapprincess">scrapprincess</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367067/#Comment_367067" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-13T03:04:24+00:00" title="March 13, 2012  3:04AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            THIS IS A PLAY REPORT FROM THE FIRST GAME OF THIS PLAYED ON G+ IF ANYONE IS GOING TO CHECK BACK ON THIS FORUM<br/><br/><br/>GLAMOUR RAGE: WHAT PRICE A BFF? play report, by the incomparable SCRAP "cheekbones that could cut a man in half" PRINCESS:<br/>Some slight tech issues at the start meant that +Mike Fernandez had trouble connecting and we just ploughed ahed leaving him behind.

Next time I wanna try with 3 or 4, but probs gonna have run a few different games in order for there to be JUSTICE . I'll write up my thoughts as DUNGEON MISTRESS about this all later, for now enjoy the show:<br/><br/>Our episode starts on sparse subway train, hurtling through the glistening titled tubes of City. Suddenly! Spooky flashing light and near the entire train is frozen in time! Except 5 special individuals! WHo are the player characters! Wow! What a twist! What drunken car of fate has chosen these people to be untouched by the powers of the TREPANNER,a steampunk visionary , determined to let the light into peoples lives?<br/>A FIGHT SCENE!<br/>The trepanner armed with straps , copper, goggles, a frictionator, zaps and weaves, evading the VIOLENCE under the seats of the train, Monofliment whips , grannys as improvised clubs and blood sucking cats SEEK HIM OUT but he is evasive! A BYSTANDER frozen is CUT IN HALF like SOFT MOTHERFUCKING CHEESE by a stray monofliment whip and becomes CRISMON INTERIOR DECORATING . TIna you cold cold cold SCIENCE BASTARD. But ! The tide turns againest the TREPPANER and the Bruteiful school girl grasps him with her dainty paw and casts him out the window!<br/>His time stopping back malfunctions! A grenade is thrown! Is there time to disable it with science? No! But the steam powered grenade is knocked away before CARNAGE HAPPENS. The subtrain, still IMMOTILE in time, now has a great and terrible gash. OUT SWOOPS THE BRUTE and BEATS THE TREPPANERS HEAD IN. BEATS IT IN LIKE A RIPE MELON FULL OF BRAIN AGAINST PRISTINE SUBWAY TILES! IS THIS SYMBOLIC OF THE MODERN CONDITION? SHIT WHY NOT! Time resumes! Distress and blood! Trampling and cats bandaging head injurys! Cute BUT wrong!<br/><br/>The party disperses! To meet up at the big video screen in the city square, according to the tickertape instructions via Zaks TOTALLY NOT A ROBOT STOP LOOKING AT ME FLESHY character. For DAMAGE has been done to the TIMEMEAT and this disparate group wishes to address this with A CAPER.<br/>Reynaldo (NOTE TO SELF WRITE DOWN CHARACTERS NAMES) swishy muscle stacked dame adorns herself for this dream date. People start getting their shit together. WHAT HAS TIME WOUNDED WROUGHT?<br/>Why its a frigging TREX! How do you like them BEANS? Firebreathing? COZ TREXS DO THAT WHO THE FRIG KNEW???<br/>Another fight is had. Destruction is spewed like so much waddery. The trex, ancient king of more grandiose age is de-ankled, force hammered and small blue taxi-clubbed back into oblivion! A wonder of NATURES DRUG ABUSE sleeps once more. Farewell sweet scaley prince, this age is too small for your beauty.<br/><br/>TINAs ROBOT takes a SAMPLE of BLOOD, the robot provides internal devices, she provides the knowledge to use said devices JOKES ABOUT PAST RELATIONSHIPS AND INSERTIONS ARE HAD . Both robots are metric! Science in a dark dirty alley is had!<br/>SOme words I fail to pronounce describe the finger print of scientific buggery that has let to this. A plan is made to trace this and stop further TIMEHOLES happening. THE local astronomy lab, radio tower and hard-on collider are suggest as tools to detect the CHRONOCRAZYNESS. THe astronomy lab is chosen! Public transport is taken, the lead scientist DR SCHEINDER is happy to help. An secret motive is not suspected , and the party is lead into a lab, only to discover the equipment only disperses FOOD PELLETS and OUCHYS OF ELECTRICITY . WHat the shit?<br/>WHAT THE SHIT? It is discover that they were shrunk and teleported into box, a skinnerian box! To be tested in the most dumbdumb of stimulus response school of BRAINQUACKERY. An escape is had, due to to monofliliment whips, a shrinky door modified . TO EMBIGGIN. Instructions are not followed cleary by A MAGIC GIRL and Zaks character is DISSAPPEAREDANATED. The rest of the party makes it through, the shrinky door makes them big, then catches fire, the sprinkler system is activated with VIOLENCE. Everyone leaves the building in an orderly fashion. THE ASTRONOMY LAB THEN IMPLODES. Holy balls!<br/>The party regards its work. The strongest school girl in the world declares "fuck it, science went wrong, we foiled some science, maybe not the science we made go wrong but whatever" (I paraphrase here) and FLYS OFF INTO THE SUNSET. The credits roll, and the camera pans to reveal Pteradons now gliding majestic above CITYs skyline. A certain not-a-robot telefrags one and falls into the sea, to wash up on the beach. Trilobites adorn him, a child pokes him with a toy shovel and we fade to black.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_367335">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367335/#Comment_367335" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-13T19:30:58+00:00" title="March 13, 2012  7:30PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whoa!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
