I don't have much interest in ever being a musician. Thankfully there are scores of people who create music I can enjoy. I'm happy to support these people for what they do and I have other outlets for my creativity,<br/>\n<br/>\nWho creates for the creators of music? People who make instruments and other tools used to produce sound, it's a good business but probably smaller then finished music? I don't have numbers that is just a gut thing. At least people who sell finished music are not mostly selling broken dreams and pawn shop barter tokens.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>rpg</b><br/>\n<br/>\nI feel the rpg industry is currently full of tools... tools to produce rpgs, and I have to ask why? Why create almost exclusively for creators? I have no doubt in my mind more people want to take part in this pastime but are simply not interested in or capable of producing it. Setting books that dont have rules, ghost/echo like fill in the blank game design. these are not finished songs to be experienced and then reflected by the audience, they are tools to build a theoretical finished experience. I'm not saying tools are bad (though I did pick that word because it made me snicker) i'm just saying there is likely a much larger base for "finished rpgs".<br/>\n<br/>\nQuestion is what do you feel would qualify as a finished rpg. what does the parallel of instrument/music mean for table top gaming? Dont feel the need to list something that already exists, I'm more interested in what you feel would be different about a "finished rpg".                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_282598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282598/#Comment_282598" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-23T07:59:58+00:00" title="July 23, 2010  7:59AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you think about it, Music has been around for millennia. I'm sure in the beginning when the concept of music was just acquired by various cultures, a lot of time was spent playing with various things that made sound until they found something that sounded pleasant. If you think about an instrument like a xylophone, they'd have to put a bunch of them together.<br><br>Now to draw that analogy to RPGs, with different mechanics we're each finding things that sound cool. Now for example a percentile system like BRP is the equivalent of a drum. It works pretty well, it's fairly simple, and all you do is play with the beat, and a little bit with the tone. That's cool for music, but getting something like a piano or a violin built is going to require some different mechanics, and each of these indie RPGs is like a single string or playing with striking the string like a dulcimer or plucking like a lute or stroking like a viola. <br><br>You're seeing RPGs going in various directions, with a ton of different ways of playing with probabilities for success, playing with task resolution and conflict resolution, playing with the player/GM dynamic or entirely removing it, a bunch of systems playing with automatic success, systems playing with player sovereignty over characters and playing with shared characters, systems that build relationship webs and systems that let them be roleplayed out.<br><br>Then like music, often what's popular isn't the specifc mastery of music skill, it's often the lyrics - people find lyrics and a story that resonates with them. Players will be drawn to settings and themes that resonate with them, and the trick is to match it with the right mechanics. Tori Amos works well with piano, and would also work well with acoustic guitar, but wouldn't work at all with RAP or an electric guitar. <br><br>There are some systems that do this - you've got Trail of Cthulhu which theme wise is appealing to a lot of people (as CoC shows), and the mechanics are directly suited to investigations, particularly built around adventures which are set out in advance by the GM. It's a system finely tuned for investigations specifically for people who like investigative stories. You've also got Diaspora, which theme wise resonates for everyone who likes Traveller and Star Trek, and mechanically is brilliant for having world and setting creation set up, so you're really discovering strange new worlds, and again the mechanics are perfect by squishing 4 dimensions onto 1 dimension for space combat, so you're not spending a ton of time with a map. What's worth looking at though is Diaspora's history - it drew obviously on Traveller, but also it started with FUDGE which then went through several iterations of FATE, and FATE turned up in quite a few systems I find interesting but don't resonate (with me anyway), and then finally settles with Diaspora where it's perfect. FUDGE and FATE were both designed for creators, and eventually creators came and took the instruments, scales and harmonies provided by them, and made songs that people want to hear.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_282606">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/daw65" title="daw65"><img alt="daw65" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/daw65">daw65</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282606/#Comment_282606" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-23T09:14:39+00:00" title="July 23, 2010  9:14AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my mind, we have "finished RPGs".

In that case, a finished RPG would have a script for everyone to follow, and would be similar to a stage play -- just with fewer props and costumes and no audience.  A table reading for a play or a television show, in other words.<br/><br/>I agree with daw65:  I'm not really understanding what you're looking for here.  Are you thinking about something like the old Lone Wolf series, books that basically let you go through a pre-written adventure rolling dice and following instructions until you reach the end?  A CRPG like one of the Final Fantasy games, where the characters and dialogue and plot are all pre-written and you just select combat actions in between cutscenes?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_282614">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB" title="PeterBB"><img alt="PeterBB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB">PeterBB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282614/#Comment_282614" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-23T09:55:04+00:00" title="July 23, 2010  9:55AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm tempted to say that Sorcerer was a revolutionary instrument, and Dogs in the Vineyard is a fantastic piece written for it.

It tells you what to do and when you need to do it but with no further instruction on how to maximally benefit from those procedures.  The rules are complete but it lacks a strategy guide.  Or to stick with the music analogy it's a complete fingering chart for a flute with no discussion of music theory.<br/><br/>In that regard I consider "FATE" to be FAR more toolbox-y than Ghost/Echo.  Ghost/Echo gives you clear direction to what end to put the rules, "Answer these questions."  Vanilla FATE does not.<br/><br/>While I'm all gonzo nuts about RPG rules being procedurally complete with a clear directed purpose as well as detailed analysis on to how to maximize their usage, I wouldn't go so far as to want an RPG that didn't require thoughtful and creative application of those rules.  Two groups applying a consistent ruleset differently to roughly the same fictional situation, is not the same as designing new rules or changing existent ones.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_282635">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Silverlion" title="Silverlion"><img alt="Silverlion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/943/nF5ZRHUHC8M5A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Silverlion">Silverlion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282635/#Comment_282635" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-23T11:40:16+00:00" title="July 23, 2010 11:40AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually I think the difference is: Games are about playing.

He's responding to me asking him to expand on his assertion that AW is one of the best games ever made, and I think it fits right in with this topic: why is AW a "finished" rpg, in the way that Tyler is talking about it? Here we go:<br/><br/><i><br/>   * the explicit way that AW tells players when to engage the mechanics (the "When X happens" part of how moves are structured, which derives from the players making assessments about the shared fiction),<br/>    * the explicit way that AW tells the MC when and how to assert narrative authority, though MC moves, and also attempts to explicitly transmit attitudes and approaches through describing basic principles ("barf forth apocalyptica," etc.),<br/>    * the "object oriented" nature of how moves are designed, which makes them super robust for hacking,<br/>    * the way the basic structure of most die-rolling moves (10+, 7-9, 6 or less) builds on Otherkind Dice,<br/>    * the awesomeness of the various moves that don't require rolls, bits of structured freeform for the players (along with the MC's principles and MC moves, which are totally structured freeform; indeed, you could make a freeform version of AW pretty easily), and<br/>    * overall, the way in which the explicitness of the various components of AW (player moves, MC moves, core principles, etc.) provide a language for talking about how to play and GM games, a pretty robust language that we can share.  For example, if I'm writing a AW hack and change some of the core principles, I can make it explicit how I want people to approach the game, instead of trying to imply it through paragraphs of GM advice.  I still need to explain my new principles in detail, of course, but the fact that I have to boil them down to pithy phrases means I have to be very explicit about them."</i><br/><br/>a couple of the points aren't totally salient for this discussion (hacking stuff, Otherkind stuff), but all the stuff about <i>explicitness</i> is super-relevant. A finished rpg, as opposed to a toolbox rpg, has to have procedures for how play goes down: When do we go to the mechanics? What are our roles as players, and how do we perform them? etc.                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_282781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

While I picked up a supplement or two I never ran anything outside of that box set. After that I played a bunch of board and card games and actually forgot I had played any rpg's for the longest time<br/>\n<br/>\nI will list my "story games" experiences<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst exposure was a game of PTA and game of cold city. I loved how PTA was playable without much prep and from the demonstration kind of helped us along with making a story (have yet to read the book). I really enjoyed the pre-made adventure in cold city, but the game broke early because people at the table wanted really different things from the game and the player tension was enough that people just simply ran away the table.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince then I have played a few of Jake and nick's games, mouse guard, ocean, specter of the beast, Cannibali Contagion and not much more. i really want to play more of the games discussed here.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy general thought is that most of the games help people who are already interesting, be interesting with their friends. worthy but it leaves me feeling like the games should offer a little more.<br/>\n<br/>\nA little background on where this question came from. In the last few years I really wanted to get my friends role playing again, I like star wars so I tried to put together a game and run it (saga edition if it matters to you).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy problem was it took the same energy to prepare that game as it did to create my own games from scratch, Given I was working on projects like big big battles and a portfolio of games I shop around to publishers, spending time to build this one off star wars rpg simply did not make sense. It was a feeling completely different then getting to play a new board game or card game. Reading the book and trying to build a game from it was completely draining.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaking a game from an RPG book is like someone with an office job learning guitar on the weekends, It's hard, but the results and personal growth are worth it even if the experience is not always enjoyable. Only instead of music, with an rpg they are dabbling in game design. There is nothing wrong with this, it's great! but i am sure there is something that can reach more people. and i'm also sure the games played by the people here have something to offer.<br/>\n<br/>\n". If I wanted to create a complete set of events, I'd write a novel."<br/>\n- Joshua A.C. Newman<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah but I don't that thats what a complete rpg is or has to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nI started this discussion to see what people were thinking about, from other things I have read it sounded like people were fairly in agreement that most rpgs were "incomplete". I wanted to know if anyone had any ideas as to what a complete rpg may be. Not surprised Vincent's games came up I agree with all his writing i have read (still need to actually play his games!)<br/>\n<br/>\nA traditional rpg gives players something to find interesting (books of character rules, monster descriptions and settings) and then present or apply in interesting ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe games I find here give interesting people an excuse or framework to be interesting (rules to start and finish a round of play, and maybe some form of narrative currency).<br/>\n<br/>\nI think a complete game that will work for most people should do both and yet still a little more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_283146">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.
