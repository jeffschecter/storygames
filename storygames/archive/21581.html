<b>Update</b>For a more current overview, see <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/22146/2097e-house-rule-overview-june-2019/p1" rel="nofollow">here instead</a>. 
<h1 id="house-rules">House rules</h1><h2 id="removed-skills">Removed skills</h2><ul><li>Deception</li><li>Performance</li><li>Persuasion</li><li>Insight</li><li>Intimidation</li><li>Investigation</li></ul><p>If you want your character to say something, say it. If you want your character to look in a drawer, say that you look in a drawer.</p><p>(I can get onboard for using these skills together with the new downtime rules in Xanathar, where you can, for example, use Persuasion to roll on the Carousing table.)</p><h2 id="using-arrows">Using arrows</h2><ul><li>You <a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/arrow_threat/" rel="nofollow">only have to pay arrows when it’s established</a> that an arrow must have been released.
<ul><li>When their HP is reduced to zero by your attack</li><li>When the arrow is caught
<ul><li>For example, when someone catches your arrow (monks can do this)</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>If you do use extra arrows beyond that, that’s how many you can recover after the fight.
<ul><li>Not necessarily the same arrows, but the same amount, maybe some are lying around.</li><li>As an example of “extra” arrow usage, you might shoot an arrow that gets stuck in the owlbear’s thick hide.</li></ul></li></ul><p>This rule means that you can (by making attack rolls against their AC) threaten someone with a drawn, loaded bowstring and their HP will be reduced by sheer terror. This rule means that you can (by making attack rolls against their AC) take successive turns aiming at someone and reducing their HP by reducing their position, their chance of surviving the fight. This rule also means that you can just spam arrows at someone, releasing an arrow every round. You describe your shooting in a way that’s cool to you or that makes sense in the situation.</p><h2 id="distances-speeds">Distances &amp; Speeds</h2><p>We don’t use any maps, playing boards or other minaturized spatial representation.</p><p><b>Edit:</b>Oh, wow, this part has changed a lot. We now use a system kinda similar to The One Ring with volley rounds and backrank/frontrank.</p><h2 id="initiative-systems">Initiative systems</h2><p>If one side has light — on their own person, i.e. holding torch or having a lit shield, not a lantern set down on the floor — that person, and all their allies in the same mêlée group, strike before opponents who don't have such light. If the light situation is equal, who ever is on their home turf strike first.</p><h2 id="we-go-to-the-statue-room">“We go to the statue room”</h2><p>Since we don’t use maps &amp; minis, I’m more generous when players speak in predicate terms of where they want to go and not super punishing about them getting lost.</p><h2 id="left-not-north">“Left”, not “North”</h2><p>I describe rooms as you would see them from your own POV, not from above. I use the room we’re playing in, I make gestures, I try to make it vivid.</p><h2 id="encounter-checks">Encounter checks</h2><p>“Wandering monster checks” are now “encounter checks” that the players make. They can use inspiration on these. I use whatever dice is in the particular module or region we’re in, but if needed I flip it so that high is safe, low is danger.</p><h2 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h2><p>I hand out tokens for “good roleplay”. I want to have the strict definition “when being true to your character gets them into trouble” (inspired by Fate) but I sometimes can’t help myself and give it out for other cool stuff as well.</p><p>You can have any amount of such tokens but if you want to give yourself, or someone else, advantage or disadvantage, the price is all of your tokens, no matter if you have 1 token or 30 tokens. This is to emulate the “you either have it or haven’t it, it doesn’t accumulate” nature of RAW inspiration.</p><p>Also we emphatically <em>don’t</em> use the common house rule that you can spend insp to get a second chance <em>after</em> a failed roll. You have to place your bet <em>before</em> you roll. This is RAW, but, since that house rule is so common this bears mentioning here.</p><p>Also we’ve had the insp tokens serve double duty to be drama tokens from Dramasystem. I.e. you get one from the other when you give in (or from the pool if they have none), you get two from the other if you give in when you <strong>really</strong> don’t want to give in (and if they don’t have two, this can’t happen), and they get three from you if you override them trying to give you two in that way (and they keep their two – again, you need to have three for that to happen).</p><p>So that’s a way for it for the amount of tokens you have to matter.</p><h2 id="the-searcher">The Searcher</h2><p>A simpler class, inspired by Searchers of the Unknown and Three Sixteen. <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20658/the-searcher-very-simple-5e-class/p1" rel="nofollow">Explained here</a>.

                            Wow, this is fantastic. I wish all games had such a clear formulation of what options are in play and why. <br/><br/>I love having a different class/rules for drop-in players - thoughtful design. How often do you end up using that, and does anyone ever play a Searcher in the long-term?<br/><br/>Two other questions:

Sounds excellent. What happens if someone is trying to prevent someone to get to a certain place or engagement? (Like, "Hey, let's defend the Wizard while he prepares his spell.")

I've had some use it for months and months. No one in my new group, yet.<br/>I'm pretty happy with people <i>not</i> using it. Many people kinda resent being given "training wheels" while others are super hesitant to do any nerd stuff so they're happy with the Searcher.

I don't know anyway to prevent him from being shot with bullets or arrows. To defend him from melee engagements you can engage the foes in separate melee groups some distance away from the wizard and when they try to leave you, you get opportunity attacks on them. That's a tactic every class can do. Conversely, if you have <a href="http://open5e.com/classes/fighter.html" rel="nofollow">the protection fighting style</a>, you can do the opposite -- stand next to the wizard and impose disadvantage on the foes with your shield.<br/><br/>Also you can engage with the environment, blocks, crates, walls etc (in predicate space rather than precise ranges and positions).

The player who adjudicates whether or not a character is persuaded is the player that plays that character. Having two tokens is a way to make an exception to that -- you can't force exactly what you want, but you can force a significant emotional concession.

That contradiction is a bit of a darling of mine. Maybe it's too clever for it's own good but I think it's interesting.

Maybe that tension is good? But I'm not sure how they feel. Usually having a big pile of them is meant to be a sign that "hey, you should've used insp more", but the contradiction dilutes that which is a sign that maybe this house rule is a bit flawed.                        </div>

                            Great answers, Sandra. Sounds like an excellent set of house rules.<br/><br/>I can't tell whether "that tension is good" without having played. I, like you, think that contradiction is very interesting and rather novel. Worth experimenting with!<br/><br/>Reminds me a touch of Eero's "princess game", where having a strong pile of dice or tokens translated to higher status in your interactions with others.<br/><br/>I'm still not following how the tokens work as emotional pressure or concessions, though. Can you help me out?

So:<br/><br/>* Ashira wants something from Max.<br/>* Max says, "No way would my character do that!"<br/>* Ashira hands him a token. "Oh, ok!" Says Max, and gives in. <br/><br/>Or is Max *forced* to give in when she offers him the token?<br/><br/>How do we know when you "really" don't want to give in? Is it just a question of the player saying, "No, that's going to take two tokens from you!"?<br/><br/>Now, if you offer me two tokens, can I refuse, but only by giving you three in return? And does that mean that I *can't* refuse an overture that's backed up by two tokens, unless I have at least 3 myself? That sounds like tokens would be an incredibly powerful influence, especially since I don't necessarily control when I can earn more. <br/><br/>And what does an "emotional concession" look like, if you're not actually giving in to the demand or plea?<br/><br/>I can't quite parse that first sentence I quoted from you, above, I guess! Sorry. It sounds interesting, though, so I'd like to understand it.<br/><br/>Also, do these tokens come into play when interacting with NPCs? If so, do NPCs get piles of tokens, too, or what?                        </div>

Thanks, I had a brain lapse while writing it.<br/><br/>WotC released rules to convert adventures from B/X, 1e, 2e, 3e etc. We use those rather than Stan Shinn's fan made conversion rules which have very different math.<br/>"They" = WotC

OK so this system is from Dramasystem, and we don't always use it. (Sometimes we just want a less drama-focused game.)<br/><br/>Here is how it works if&amp;when it's in play:<br/><br/>* Ashira wants something from Max.<br/>* Max knows that if he gives in, he'll get a token, and if he is steadfast, he'll give a token<br/>* Max chooses how to react.<br/><br/>But, you never say "No way would my character do that!"<br/>You say "No way, <i>I</i> won't do that." Because you act these scenes out in character.<br/>And the way they're acted out, how persuasive Ashira's character can be in her actual choice of words, arguments, leverage, pleading, etc etc that will affect how Max reacts.<br/>(That's true even if we don't use the tokens.)<br/><br/>And if the one who is supposed to pay one token don't have any tokens, they can pay from the "bank". That's another way more insp enters the economy.<br/><br/>Now, if Max is steadfast and Ashira wants to override his decision, she can pay two tokens. She can't force him to give him exactly what she wants, but something significant. And to counter that, Max has to pay three tokens.<br/><br/>And if the one who is supposed to pay two or three tokens don't have any tokens, they can't force or override in that way.

NPC:s have a shared pool that's separate from the "bank". So every human at the table have their own pool + there's a big bowl at the center of the table. The DM's pool is for all the NPC:s combined.                        </div>

And if the material component doesn’t cost money, there are two ways to get around the material component: you can assume that it’s something you already happened to have in your component bag, or, you can use your arcane focus instead of the material component.

It evidently works for some, but I am absolutely against using Player Conversation as opposed to Character Conversation. In other words, having the player convince the GM rather than the character convince the NPC.<br/><br/>Before you rip my head off, let me explain:<br/><br/>My character is a construct, a being that I put together to play out a story. Part of that might be making this character a witty conversationalist, intuitive interrogator or expert seducer. Now just as I, a real-life person, could not put together the knife-fighting moves to kill a grizzly bear, it is entirely likely that I could not negotiate, seduce or interrogate my way out of paper bag, <br/><br/>By removing the mechanics that allow my character to be far more persuasive, seductive or intuitive than I am as a player, you are removing my ability to create a communication-led character. No tabletop systems require a player to physically fight the GM in order to defeat an NPC in combat, yet that is essentially the road being taken in removing the mechanics for communication and replacing it with player input.<br/><br/>BY all means encourage role-playing. Ask the player to give some hint as to what their character wants to say and how they want to say it. Maybe allow a bonus to the dice roll if the player comes up with a really good concept. But then let the mechanics, like an editor or stylist polishing a basic concept, take that rough idea and frame it in the way that the character would express it.                         </div>

And who's fault is that? Everyone in my playgroup is at that level of physical, intellectual, spiritual and social prowess.<br/><br/>That's why we need the traits, ideals, bonds and flaws — to reward us for portraying characters with flaws and weaknesses that we don't have in order to make the game more interesting and challenging. This includes the NPCs. When we portray the PCs and NPCs we have to pull our punches. It is our job to try to mockingly, and with pity, portray the PCs and NPCs like the puny ants they are compared to our own gigantic stature radiating with wit and brilliance. Real life hold no challenges for us anymore, no conflict. It's become boring since everything is so easy. That's why we play D&amp;D.                        </div>

And how did we get that way in the first place? By playing D&amp;D with these rules. By actually practicing negotiation, sleuthing, investigation, problem solving, persuasion, reason in a world of make believe where if we fucked up, only our character's were at stake.<br/><br/>And also there are spells in the game? You can use detect magic, disguise self etc etc<br/>♥<br/><br/>Like, last session the party came upon a bunch of dradkins smashing up a sephus rock. And they yoinked the rock while casting an illusion spell that made it look like the rock was still there. It only fooled the dradkin for one round but that was enough for the party to hightail it out of there. Pretty awesome♥                        </div>

That's fine. I wasn't looking start a discussion, merely an observation on your choice of house-rules. The fact that you have introduced/altered those rules shows that you are happy with it. I'm not calling anyone out for preferring one style over another.                        </div>

ToA has a bigger scale with one day per hex instead of a few hours per hex, and simplified rules.</p><h3 id="navigation-near-coasts-lakes-and-rivers">Navigation near coasts, lakes and rivers</h3><p>You were reluctant to roll, you just said “we don’t go back into the forest helt enkelt” but the hexes are big patches of various terrain. The map just is representative of the most <em>common</em> terrain on the hex, which also sets the DC. 15 for rivers and jungles, 10 for lakes and coastal areas.</p><h3 id="hidden-rolls-for-where-you-go-when-youre-lost">Hidden rolls for where you go when you’re lost</h3><p>It’s a secret 1d6 roll. I could draw playing cards A,2,3,4,5,6 and reveal them once you find your way, or I could roll under cups and then lift the cups once you find your way. Let me know if this is what you want or if you are OK with me keep doing the hidden 1d6 roll. 1 is north, 2 is northeast, 4 is south etc. (You might accidentally end up where you want to go, too.)</p><h2 id="canoes">Canoes</h2><p>OK if you get canoes the rate you can travel faster on the river (even upstream). 2 hexes per day instead of one. River and Flask misremembered it when you were asking them but I just double checked the rules.</p> </div>

<h2 id="fifteen-twelvetwenty">Fifteen &amp; Twelve/Twenty</h2><p>I know a lot of DCs (usually there is a DC from a rule, from an opposing NPC, or from the module text) but when I don’t I have two standards. 15 when there’s a possible-and-reasonable yes/no. And when I have an idea on how to succeed at a serious cost, I like to offer a twelve/twenty.</p><p>The DMG p 242 suggests 15/20 for the same purpose but I’ve changed it to 12/20 to better match the probabilities in Dungeon World and Apocalypse World, since I harvest them for many ideas for these successes-with-costs. In those games there’s about a 40% chance to get a success-with-cost and I like that better than 25%. I mean if there’s only a 25% of the ternarity of the operation mattering then why bother, I could just use a DC 15 yes/no instead.</p><p>Also a 12 is nicer to you than a 15 is and the DC for a full-no-strings-attached success is the same, 20. So it’s a win/win for you too.</p><p>In the session yesterday, I offered a DC 12 for finding that particular Flaming Fist squad, and a DC 20 for also not losing yourself in the same process. (I.e 1-11: you lose them and yourself, 12-19 you find them but don’t know where you are, and 20+ you find them and you also know where you are.) A DC 12 might sound like an overly easy test to find a squadron in a five mile radius area (the hexes are 10 mile diameter), but, the cost was so big so I don’t regret giving you that offer. And you were smart to not take it.</p><h2 id="dc-10-and-dc-20">DC 10 and DC 20</h2><p>There is one situation where I think DCs 10 and DC 20 makes sense and that’s for passive knowledge – we changed them to “B-färdigheter” a la Drakar &amp; Demoner and then it’s up to me to think “is this piece of knowledge something you would definitely know (no check needed), easily know (DC 10), maybe know (DC 15), possibly know (DC 20) and definitely not know (no check needed) and then compare it to your passive knowledge score. Matthew was doing this a lot, he wanted his character to be knowledgable. I don’t like having to be subjective but hey that’s the DM’s job sometimes T_T to be a subjective referee and make unusual &amp; subjective calls. T_T</p> </div>

<h2 id="sleeping-without-a-tent">Sleeping without a tent</h2><p>Before Xanathar’s came out I came up with <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/454353/#Comment_454353" rel="nofollow">a house rule together with some friends</a>, which was this: normally when you sleep your exhaustion levels move one step to 0. But when you sleep without a tent, I thought it would move one step toward 2. (I.e. make it worse if you didn’t have exhaustion but make it better if you had severe exhaustion.)</p><p>But Xanathar’s now has clearer guidelines for <em>uncomfortable sleep</em>:</p><p>You neither gain nor lose exhaustion levels and you only regain ¼ of spent hit dice.</p><p>And it repeats the rule for <em>forgoing long rests completely</em>: * DC 10 con save or suffer one exhaustion level. * The next day it’s DC 15 con save. The next day it’s DC20 and so on. * Resets to DC 10 after one long rest.</p><p>I’m not sure if sleeping in the merciless rain with disease-carrying insects counts as uncomfortable sleep or forgoing sleep. I’ll think about it some more. Use tents.</p> </div>

                            Predicates rule. I wonder if Mêlée groups can be represented by patterns on paper, with a sidelist of exceptions (reach and aerial) ? That would make it easier for beginners : just place your miniature or token on the zone you want. Then you could simply connect different melee groups with a pen.<br/>There could be various IA for Monster targets.<br/>These pieces of advice cost me nothing.                        </div>

                            ♥<br/><br/>However, I found that just connecting mêlée groups didn't work because combatants sometimes leave one group and join another.<br/><br/>I use cards, which is good because I can tap them once the player has done their main action. The downside is that I wanted it to be pure totm and I kinda shy away from any sorta… "representation". The closer we get to miniatures, the sooner our first person dungeon crawl experience turns into some sorta Gauntlet or Zelda style top down game where the little ants are the ones in danger, not us.                        </div>

                            But while each player can remember who they are fighting it's hard for the DM to keep track of everything so some sorta spreadsheet, table, or diagram is something I'm always thinking of. Esp good if it keeps track of monster hp.<br/>The prob is that I'd need 3 dimensions. Monsters × Heroes × Rounds.<br/>(Not that I need to keep track of past rounds but that if I don't have a time axis to scribble along, I'd have to erase the previous rounds mêlée rounds to make room to record the new ones.)<br/> </div>

                            OK I came up with a solution so I can ditch the cards. They've worked fine for the last six months but as usual I post on here and think everything is final and then three seconds later I get a bunch of ideas.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="https://idiomdrottning.org/deadsheet_example.png"/><br/><br/>One line per hero.<br/><br/>Top left: four columns for "Special" (Armor of Agathys, Conjured beings), "Aggro" (if the monsters hate them, i.e. Sneak Attack and similar), "Conditions" (if the monsters can get in with adv/disadv) and "Front rank" if the hero is in the front rank.<br/><br/>Then the list of hero names.<br/><br/>Then a column where you draw one line each time the hero makes their main turn action. [Don't do it for Action Surge or similar]. This is the equiv of tapping the card in the old system.<br/><br/>Then the mêlée group cross-reference area, in which there is a column per monster.<br/><br/>Underneath, each monster column has their starting HP, maybe a name, and then how much damage they've taken (I suck at subtraction so with this I can count up instead of down). Monster conditions such as grappled or Vicious Mockery can go in mixed in among the HP calcs.<br/><br/>In the example, Ashinell and Ran are in the back rank,<br/>Fox, Ran and Troll have taken one action each,<br/>Troll has taken 14 damage (heroes need to keep track of their own HP on their sheets),<br/>and Fox and Troll are in a mêlée group together.<br/><br/>Plenty of space underneath the monster names to jot down monster HP.<br/>Am thinking that maybe three square wide monster columns are better, will try that.<br/>All of this is unplaytested. I've been thinking about this for years (I started even before I came up with the "card" system) and finally something shook loose in my head.                        </div>
