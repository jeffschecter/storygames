There is sort of a module, called Historiens vingslag (something like "Wings of History") that's about playing through the history of the world, though that module has never been published. Basically, it works like this:<br/><br/>You start off at some point in time. If you're gonna build a fantasy world, you might start at the beginning, when the gods create the world. If you do a scifi world, maybe you start with today. Or maybe you want to do alternate history or somesuch. Anyway, you all make a bunch of Power Factions and they have conflicts with each other. Every player has an agenda, like "Anarchy" or "Compassion" or something, and the conflicts are basically the players pushing the world closer to their agenda. So maybe there's a country, a disease, a prophet and another country. Anarchy might make the one country try to kill the king of the other country. Compassion might make the prophet try to put a stop to the fightings by uniting the countries with religion. That sort of thing. If you want to do something that's not an attack on anybody, you have to create a new Power Faction that it is an attack on. So if you wanna colonize a new land, you can make the natives a Power Faction, or maybe Isolationists, or whatever.<br/><br/>Then, after each conflict, someone won, someone gets to narrate and someone gets to add a little detail that must be included in the narration. After narration (or as part of it), the winner gets to decide a consequence of the conflict. So if the assassination succeeded, the consequence might be a deep cultural distrust between the two nations. If the religious unity succeeds, the consequence might be a religion that preaches peace. You can add all sorts of consequences, like my favorites, expressions that find their way into common speech. All these consequences are written down on a paper to act as interesting details when you later play in the setting. The conflicts are also written down, along with a year, like "542: The great Umbrian Civil War".<br/><br/>When people feel it's time, the Age is ended, given a name (like "The Age of Strife") and the most powerful Factions survive into the next age, whilst the weaker succumb and new ones are created in their stead. And that's pretty much the game. The cool thing about it is that when you game in the world, you have these nifty little details thatr you can use and you have a rich history. And when you say that this sword was forged in the time of the Great Umbrian Civil War, everyone knows exactly what that is, because <i>they were there</i>.<br/><br/>Something else that you can do that's totally cool is to do the history game for a while, until you reach an interesting conflict, then zoom in, make characters that are in the middle of it. Then you play a session at that time and see what happens. Then you zoom out, name a consequence and keep playing history. I had an idea of playing a game of this all the way from prehistory to scifi, stopping at certain moments to zoom in on the action. alas, I've never had a chance to.<br/><br/>And that's it. Dunno if you can get something from this thread. If anyone is interested, I could sketch out the actual mechanics. Or maybe you could just bring the concept of consequences (which was what Shreyas liked) into other games that feature world-changing conflicts.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214708">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214708/#Comment_214708" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-27T14:04:12+00:00" title="June 27, 2009  2:04PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and another really cool thing you can do is zoom in or out with the worldbuilding game.

Five? Eight? Ten?). Before play begins, people talk about the type of setting and sort of a general mood. Then everyone choose their own agenda based on that. A world defined by the conflicts between Chaos, Order, Death and Spirituality is going to look very different from a world defined by the conflicts between Isolation, Fear, Community and Love. As you can see, it helps if you pick Agendas that are somewhat in conflict with each other. Also, sometimes we change Agendas inbetween the Ages, so one Age is played between a certain set of Agendas, and the next looks different because there are a separate set of Agendas defining it.<br/><br/>When you have a type of setting and Agendas, you decide on what the starting point of play should be. Creation of the world is usually cool for fantasy, today for scifi, or you could do alternate history and diverge at a certain point (so start at the beginning of the first World War, for example). Or you could play "the secret history of the world" and play through real history, but with secret organizations as Factions (I haven't tried this).<br/><br/>Next, you make up Factions. To make up a Faction costs you one die. It will then have a Power of 2. Everyone takes turns. On your turn, instead of creating a Faction, you could increase the power of one. For one die, you can increase the Power from 2 to 4, or from 4 to 5. No Faction can begin with a Power higher than 5. When nobody wants to spend more dice, play begins. Factions can be mostly anything that has a profound influence on the world. A country, an idea, a disease, a weather phenomenon, even a person, or, in fantasy settings, a god (common in the first Age). I've wanted to try making an event into a Faction, but I never did that.<br/><br/>On you turn in play, you initiate an attack by one Faction on another. An attack doesn't have to be fighting. If there's a Faction that's a disease, an attack here can be that another Faction tries to cure it. If you want to do something that's not an attack on an existing Faction, you have to make up a Faction (costs one die) that it's an attack on (so if you want to industrialize the lands, Nature could be a Faction). At this point, you say what you want to happen (your stake). Taking turns, the other players can set different stakes, or agree with a stake already set.<br/><br/>So you might say "Germany occupies France" and another player can say "No, France beats the shit out of Germany", taking on the side of France. A third player can say "I also think Germany should win" and a fourth can say "Fuck you, The Pope ends the conflict before it takes hold", taking on the side of the Pope (who wasn't even involved until just now) and a fifth can say "I also think Germany should win, but they're not gonna occupy France; they're gonna plunder it". Then dice are rolled. The attacker gets two free dice, as does the first player to take up the side of the defender. To that they can add dice from their personal pools. Everyone else only gets as many dice as they choose to spend from their personal pool. The result is calculated thusly: Highest single die plus the Power of the Faction you represent is the result. Sixes are rerolled with a +5, then +10 for another six, and so on. Ties are broken by second highest, and so on.<br/><br/>The winner narrates, but before that happens, the one who came second gets to add in a little fact, like "One little Gaul village continues to resist the Roman invasion", or "A secret research lab keeps a sample of the virus". If there's a tie for the second place, it is not broken. Instead, both get to add a fact.<br/><br/>The winner then gets to name a consequence and also chooses wether to increase the Power of the winner by one, or to decrease the Power of one of the losers by one. A Power of 0 means the Faction is eradicated.<br/><br/>When the turn comes to a player who has no remaining Dice, the Age ends. So when someone runs out, one more round is played and then finito. The Age is named and the group decides wether or not to play for another Age. If tyhey want to play for another Age, their dice pools are refreshed and the two strongest Factions survive into the next Age. Another round of creating new Factions is done and then play begins again.<br/><br/>Phew! That was a lot to write.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215158">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Natai" title="Natai"><img alt="Natai" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Natai">Natai</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215158/#Comment_215158" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-29T16:22:45+00:00" title="June 29, 2009  4:22PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An intriguiing idea to say the least. Regardless of what mechanics are used to implement it, I'd love to hear more about this. If you've ever thought of publishing it, know that at least one person would buy it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have also gone through several iterations of an epic strategy/war game. I've had lots of ideas and versions, some interplanetary some planet-bound. Possibly similar to what watergoesred is looking into. As far as intergalactic is concerned the idea would be to have an interesting and enjoyable game that lends itself to great stories. Imagine playing an epic game with the feel of Babylon 5. At times the actions of fleets and empires are the focus, at other times the action could revolve around a single location, ship, or individual.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've been getting familiar with Burning Wheel and reading some interesting topics on its forums regarding an empire-building type of game. It occured to me that linking a strategy game like this with a roleplaying/story game could be amazing. The idea of guiding empires on a galactic scale, then being able to zoom in on a regional or planetary scale, and then being able to choose the conflicts you want to move over to the roleplaying side of the house with individual characters could be truly incredible. The games I was working were already geared with a play time measured in weeks or months, so this would actually be feasible for me. Assuming I ever get it finished and find room for it in my house.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter reading the thread this spawned from, using some of the techniques presented there for creating cultures could also be used to create or develop these factions, deepening the game that much more.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, all that aside. Keep this thread going.

We did that once; it was pretty awesome.</blockquote>This idea of zooming in and out is intriguing. Did you ever give the zooming a mechanical effect? <br><br/>For instance, say your playing a game that has been following the history of a planet with nation-states. If you zoomed into the internal state of a nation and then played out that a certain faction defeated the incumbent power. Would that change in internal structure of that nation give a player extra dice when the game zoomed back out to international level? Say, the the new faction in power was aligned with an international faction, would that international faction gain +1? <br/><br/>Or have you kept the different scales unrelated mechanically? So that the different scales are treated more as collaboratively created colour and setting. I can see costs and benefits to both. <br/><br/>For example, Burning Empires keeps the scenes and manoeuvres disconnected, allowing for there to be the success on the small scale and failure on the larger, or vice versa. This has the effect, with other parts of the system, to drive focus on the roleplaying in the lower scale of the scenes and make the larger scale of manoeuvres little more than a pacing mechanism.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_215247">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215247/#Comment_215247" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-30T02:09:14+00:00" title="June 30, 2009  2:09AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We never really zoomed in on <i>conflicts</i>. We had a world and then we wanted to play in a certain city. So we played through the most recent hundred years or so of that city's history, to get more detailed info, and used the world events as backdrops ("This is about the time the barbarians invaded, right? I'll add a barbarian chieftain as a Faction."). No mechanical influence, but plenty of influence on the fiction. But this was mostly from the larger scale to the smaller, not the other way around.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
