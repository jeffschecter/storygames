As Andy says, no doubt we'd view the death of a much-loved quilting hero with the same mix of confusion and ignorance.<br><br>I'm lucky tho, as I work in a place where most people around me know of Gary Gygax and his legacy, or at the very least can appreciate it as gamers.

I'd be much more sad when Pratchett dies or maybe Daniel Bayn, 'cause those works I enjoyed directly and not just through the lens of 20 years of RPG evolution. (And in the case of Bayn had contact with him on the internet and really enjoyed his online persona.)<br/><br/>Now, I do feel sad about the news, but this comes from two sources: One, I feel for the people Gygax was more central for then me. As we can see here, there were many people for whom he was extremely important, and I feel for their loss. Second, I'm always sad when I hear about anybody dying, simply because every death robs the world of something awesome.<br/><br/>But I don't grief directly for Gygax. I didn't know him and I had, basically, nothing to do with him.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
