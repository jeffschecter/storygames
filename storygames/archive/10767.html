So, you could track your lineage through your mother, and her father, and his mother... or you could track your lineage through your father, and his father, and his father, and his mother. You track lineage in whatever way yields the most advantageous line. So, if you want to be a politician, you track your lineage so that you have the most/best politicians in it.<br/><br/>Exercise one: declare a goal for yourself, and min/max your own lineage to yield the best results per your goal. Share or not, as you feel comfortable.<br/><br/>Exercise two: explore a way that this could be used in a roleplaying game.<br/><br/>Note: If you feel like I'm exotifying another culture/set of cultures and it's offensive... we can talk about that. I can halt this thread. I'm enchanted by this way of seeing the world, and particularly painting stories of identity and history... I see this as being directly relevant to our thinking about roleplaying and character creation, and I'm offering this not to gawk at but to celebrate and explore.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238780/#Comment_238780" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-22T13:52:01+00:00" title="October 22, 2009  1:52PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Exercise Two: Using Ambilineality as part of a roleplaying game.<br/><br/>You have a game about brothers. You give all of the players a family tree, with each entry functioning like a Burning Wheel Lifepath. They trace back their lineage five generations, yielding a certain build. That creates 32 different builds, I think.<br/><br/>Alternately, you have a game about members of a small community (probably a band). You have 4 different sets of parents, and for each set of parents you have a family tree (and you trace your lineage back 4 or 5 generations, as per above). The four sets of parents have some interweaving tree branches and some "exclusives".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
