If I were a woman living alone I'd carry a point thirty-eight revolver, minimum. Double action. Effective enough for most purposes." The startling newcomer had their surprised attention. He had stopped quite close to them and was surveying the door, and they instinctively stepped out of his way. He was tall, thin and pale, with thin brown Brylcreemed hair and dark red lips. The calculator on his hip was the finest personal computing machine, and on the other hip, from a loop of leather, hung a fencing foil, balanced so that its red plastic tip hung an inch above the floor. It was Fred Fine.<br/><br/>     "You're the guy who runs the Wargames Club, aren't you," asked the blond student.<br/><br/>     "I am Games Marshall, if that's the intent of your question.<br/>     Administrative and financial authority are distributed among the leadership cadre according to the Constitution."<br/><br/>     "The Wargames Club?" asked Gary, his voice suffused with hope. "What, is there one?"<br/><br/>     "The correct title is the Megaversity Association for Reen- actments and Simulations, or MARS," snapped Fred Fine. <br/><br/>     Still almost breathless, Gary said, "Say. Do you guys ever play 'Tactical Nuclear War in Greenland?'"<br/><br/>     Fred Fine stared just over Gary's head, screwing up his face tremendously and humming. "Is that the earlier version of 'Martians in Godthaab,' "he finally asked, though his tone indicated that he already knew the answer.<br/><br/>     Gary was hopelessly taken aback, and looked around a bit before allowing his gaze to rest on Fred Fine's calculator. "Oh, yeah, I guess. I guess 'Martians in Godthaab' must be new." <br/><br/>"No," said Fred Fine clearly, "it came out six months ago." To soften the humiliation he chucked Gary on the shoulder. "But to answer your question. Some of our plebes--our novice wargamers-- do enjoy that game. It's interesting in its own way, I suppose, though I've only played it a dozen times. Of course, it's a Simuconflict product, and their games have left a lot to be desired since they lost their Pentagon connections, but there's nothing really wrong with it."<br/><br/>     The trio stared at him. How could he know so much? "Uh, do you guys," ventured the blue one, "ever get into role- playing games? Like Dungeons and Dragons?"<br/><br/>     "Those of us high in the experiential hierarchy find conventional D and D stultifying and repetitive. We prefer to stage live-action role-playing scenarios. But that's not for just anyone." They looked timidly at Fred Fine's fencing foil and wondered if he were on his way to a live-action wargame at this very moment. For an instant, as he stood in the dim recess of the corridor, light flickering through a shattered panel above and playing on his head like distant lightning, his feet spread apart, hand on sword pommel, it seemed to them that they beheld some legendary hero of ancient times, returned from Valhalla to try his steel against modern foes. The mood was broken as another man suddenly came around the corner. <br/>....<br/> "Well, well, well," said Fred, starting in a high whine and dropping in pitch from there. I had Fred Fine in one of my classes and when in a good mood he really did talk like Colonel Klink"</blockquote>\nNeal Stephenson's first novel, published a quarter century ago, is a time capsule depicting undergrads, geeks, gamers, and professors; circa 1984.<br/><br/>The lambasting includes cliches such as a larper who loses track of the distinction between fantasy and reality; and commits suicide in the tunnels beneath campus.  But obvious geek stereotypes aren't the only recognisable caricatures.  Analogues of story games community members are also mocked in the book's campus-sized cast.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_85453">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85453/#Comment_85453" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-03T18:52:54+00:00" title="August  3, 2007  6:52PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh hey, I remember that book.  For a while it was unpublished or something (maybe out of print?), and being circulated as a text document on the internet.  I remember reading it back then and reflecting that yeah, I wouldn't publish or re-print it, either.  It wasn't very well done by any standards, and certainly not by the bar Stephenson set with his later work.<br/><br/>But I suppose that's the curse of commercial success -- no matter how poorly written your earlier work is, you can't bury it.  Once your name alone can sell a book, even your books which aren't really worth selling will end up on the shelf.  <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_85458">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Call%20Me%20Curly" title="Call Me Curly"><img alt="Call Me Curly" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Call%20Me%20Curly">Call Me Curly</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85458/#Comment_85458" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-03T19:14:26+00:00" title="August  3, 2007  7:14PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 3, 2007 7:15PM by Call Me Curly.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>It wasn't very well done by any standards</blockquote>\nAny standards, eh?<br/><br/>It was published in 1984, which puts it alongside that year's crop of Orwell-tributes such as Terry Gilliam's film "Brazil"<br/>and the rpg "Paranoia".  It's on a par with both; but that includes their flaws, too. All three are now somewhat dated in their<br/>late 70's-y punky liberal ideology and National Lampoon humor.<br/><br/>Another point of comparison would be the novels of William Gibson, which tend to escalate (or degenerate) into violent action chase sequences,<br/>much like The Big U.<br/><br/>The thing that surprised me, was how much The Big U had in common with Stephenson's later work.  Gamers appear again<br/>in Cryptonomicon, as do libertarian hackers with guns.  Bicameral Mind theory appears again in Zodiac and Snow Crash.<br/>(And in Bruce Sterling's 'Distraction').  Terrorism on a college campus appeared again in The Cobweb.<br/><br/>The Big U's dormitory setting felt awkwardly sophomoric compared to the Baroque Cycle's<br/>ambitious settings, which allowed me to pat myself on the back for being a smartypants, just for reading it.
