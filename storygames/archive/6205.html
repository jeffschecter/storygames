Robin is doing HeroQuest "revised" (the final name hasn't been determined).  But Mike and Mark are doing Other Worlds, which isn't bare-bones HeroQuest, but an entirely new system only related to HeroQuest by the fact that is has many of the ideas that they were working on for HQ implemented in a system that's only faintly familiar as HQ.<br/><br/>Mike answers some Other Worlds questions at the bottom of this thread: <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3247" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3247</a><br/><br/>Also, if you find any of my posts on RPG.net, I have in my sig links to that thread and a HeroQuest thread where Robin answers some questions on that.<br/><br/>*It might exist, if Issaries or Moon Design or whoever is doing HeroQuest now does an early idea they mentioned.  If so, QuestWorlds will be the line name for setting books to the revised generic HeroQuest rulebook.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_137806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag" title="viktor_haag"><img alt="viktor_haag" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/591/nDZQG5TW1V86P.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag">viktor_haag</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137806/#Comment_137806" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-03T06:10:12+00:00" title="April  3, 2008  6:10AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 3, 2008 6:10AM by viktor_haag.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alvin Frewer</cite>[Questworlds] might exist, if Issaries or Moon Design or whoever is doing HeroQuest now does an early idea they mentioned.</blockquote>\nMoon Design is the publisher for all Issaries properties, as far as I know (even the "unfinished works" thingummies that Stafford produces). Last I heard, HeroQuest Revised/QuestWorlds was still in PlayTest<sup>tm</sup>. Moon Design's publishing schedule has scoped a good distance out from originally announced plans, so I would not reasonably expect to see the revised rules any time soon.<br/><br/>As one of the original playtest group, I can make no further comment other than that I shouldn't be considered a source of canonical information on the subject; however, Rick Meints (proprieter of Moon Design) has taken to making frank and thorough announcements to the MD publishing schedule, when people ask him nicely, on the HeroQuest Rules mailing list, so if you want to keep abreast of developments, I suggest you join up!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
