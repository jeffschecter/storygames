                    Hello All!  (newbie here, but been in the games market for quite some time)<br/>
This is my first question that I felt had some merit here in the community.<br/>
<br/>
I am develpoing, after some years of intial development followed by several major and heartbreaking setbacks, a swords &amp; sorcery type RPG based upon character concepts and simple mechanics that mirror a realistic feel and logic as much as is possible (yes, I know ths has been done a thousand times over, but I actually believe that I can contribute something to the trite genre that would actually allow the players to have fun!).<br/>
<br/>
As an aside I am a musician, an author, and a computer programmer and have had varying levels of professional success at all of them...at least to the point where some people buy my stuff and my mommy still loves me.  I have also been involved in the RPG industry as a player, critic, and sometimes contributor since the late 1970's (Yes, I know how old that makes me).<br/>
<br/>
So here's the question: (with lots of fluffy text thrown in because I am a long-winded self-absorbed narcissist)<br/>
<br/>
After more than 2 years of develpoment (with MAJOR setbacks) and a detailed outline that has been revised and revised upon the revisions  (picture a game manual without the flowing prose that merely describes how things are done) I am now in the stage of writing the detailed and florid version of the game I am working on (the actual game text).  Lots and lots of play-testing (in the ALPHA stage) has led up to a group of rules and a singular system that seems to work the best for my goals.  It ihas a relistic feel, follows inhgerent logic, and is esy to both grasp and play.<br/>
<br/>
The three groups of Sub-Beta testers is chomping at the bit (this being two independent groups and one that I shall GM.  I strongly feel that people that are not around me should playtest so I can get totally objective opinions and suggestions) and are awaiting the actual first draft of the real game manual.<br/>
<br/>
I somehow settled on the idea that each section/ chapter should be forewarded by a small piece of fiction (about 1 or so pages of text, or less) that depicts the main points of the chapter.  As the mechanics are explained, the prose given at the beginning of the chapter is sighted to illustrate the key points and ideas.  Likewise the examples draw upon the previous prose so that the reader (whom already has a mental image of how things were going on and working out) can draw a logical line between the game mechanics, game play, and how things would be "in-game".  Since I am a fiction author of some, at least miniscule, success, this at least entertains the reader while they learn the game.  It also allows the reader to generate their own assumptions and/or visions of what is going on and how it realtes to the game in their own fashion and (hopefully) allows them to associate the game mechanics in terms of the story given earlier. <br/>
<br/>
So my question(s) (yes!!! finally he gets to the points!) is this:<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else attempted or done this before?  If so, have you had any success at it?  If you haven't; as a game developer, do you think this is a good idea?  Do you feel that by reading a simple story that does not involve game systems, rules, or mechanics first and then reading how the mechanics of the game apply to what you just read is good idea?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Please keep in mind that the prose is very short, just a few paragraphs.  Likewise it is done as if you were were reading a novel, not an example. Also, the explanations of the rules follow the events in the text so you can easily think about what you've just read and how the game mechanics might apply.<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate all comments and critiques, even if it's just to tell me that I am an idiotic windbag (please note that ALL AND ANY posts that just say "YOU ARE AN IDIOTIC WINDBAG" wil be chuckled at, but disregarded)<br/>
<br/>
Many Thanks<br/>

                            I can't think of any game that's tried quite that approach before. White Wolf got into the habit of putting a vignette before each chapter, though a lot of people complained about the quality of these (and in Exalted 2e they have 2-page comics instead), and they tended to be tangential to the contents of the chapter.<br/><br/>The closest I've gotten in my own work is in a game I'm working on currently called <i>Tokyo Heroes</i>. Since I'm trying to convey a genre that not many people know (sentai) within the book, I got sick writing noodly text and saying, "Sometimes sentai series have <i>this</i>. Often they have <i>that</i>," and decided to write a few of them in the form of a vignette.<br/><br/>So, I think it definitely could work. Like everything else, it's all in the execution.                        </div>

                            As an idea, I'd have to see it done.  Most of the background/setting material for White Wolf's <i>Demon</i> was in fiction form, and I almost threw the book across the room when I found that out.<br/><br/>I'm not against the idea of using fiction, per se, but I think that there needs to be clear expositional passages to back it up.  As I said at the time: "You can't FORCE me to read your crappy game fiction!"<br/><br/>So as long as it's not the only means of understanding the rules, go for it.                        </div>

                            A few examples off the top of my head:<br/><br/>In the conflict section (I think) of DitV, Vincent describes a cool, tense scene -- and then says something like "and now let's see how that looks with the dice", and describes the conflict again with the mechanics that are being used.<br/><br/>White Wolf's 'actual play' sections (at least for some of the later games) were in the form of comic book layouts -- on the left side of the page you had the unadorned story panels, with all the in-SIS action. On the right side the panels were overlayed with the mechanics being used as well as the dialogue between players about what is going on.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>I think it's an excellent approach in general. It's particularly great when the scene you describe has a lot of bite, and seems to include things that players might not expect to see dealt with by the mechanics (the Dogs example is good for this, of course.) If the piece of fiction is like "whoa, awesome!" and then you make a convincing case for it <i>emerging</i> from typical gameplay and mechanics, players will be hooked.                        </div>

                            From what I gather from your description <i>Tribe 8</i> did this extensively.  Throughout the gaming text fictional pieces described related ideas.  Now sometimes this was more disjointed than what it sounds like your creating.  They were trying for a more mythic, whisper-down-the-lane feel.  This bothered some folk I know but I loved it.  I like that it made the reader think about what was going on and make their own judgements about the world and the events.<br/><br/>I suppose in many ways <i>Dictionary of Mu</i> is ALL about this (and why I love it so).  I would definately check those out as solid examples of what can be done with prose.  I would consider both fantasy (although post-apocalyptic).                        </div>

                            Actually it's something I did in <a href="http://www.key20.com/product.php?productid=194" rel="nofollow">Dead of Night</a>. Each section was prefaced by a couple of pages of fiction which formed a short story called Wolf Moon, and which illustrated the rules I was about to detail. I also put a couple of paragraphs of examples, describing the fiction in games terms. <br/><br/>I'm not sure it worked though. I know a few reviewers pulled them up as things they didn't like, but this might have been more about describing/giving examples of rules that had yet to be explained. Perhaps in a future revision I'd keep the game fiction up front, but use the examples in the text, much as you describe.                        </div>

<br/>
Your comments have been more helpful than you can possibly imagine.  <br/>
<br/>
Now for another question:  Is it proper to post a piece of said fiction for everyone to pick apart so I can get a better gauge of whether or not my approach is working?  I'd really like to see more comments on this, be they edifying my idea or ripping it down.<br/>

                            OK, well I'll try to pontificate the purpose of the prose without being exceptionally boring.  This fictional text is meant as a prelude to the chapter that discusses how the levels of skill in a particular ability can vary depending upon natural traits, instinctive ability, training, and knowledge.  The prose itself is more or less stand-alone.  The discussions of the rules, examples, and points in the chapter draw upon the body of the fiction so the reader, having a mental image of the prose that they've just read, can draw upon their own ideas and thoughts to draw association to the rules .....<br/>
<br/>
Cassius watched with amusement as Ragnor drilled Ableaus in swordplay.  Constantly amazed at just how unskilled Ragnor truly was, she decided with no more than a few glances that she was superior in her mastery of the long sword.  Ableaus looked a buffoon, attempting to grasp the sword properly, let alone striking effectively.  She continued cutting and filing on the key she was making.  Cast in sand, made from discarded trinkets, and then slowly shaped by hand, the key was taking form.  Now had she had her locksmithing tools with her, this would have gone much faster.  Putting the project again into the fire to make it more malleable, she turned her attention towards her comrades and observed them with a haughty amusement.  Ragnor was already a growing legend.  He had the looks and physique for it, to be sure.  His physical prowess was perhaps his mightiest asset.  It was due to his great strength that he was such a successful swordsman.  Ableaus, on the other hand, was as inept as a child with the sword.  Although he could wield it with some effectiveness against the untrained, Cassius knew that sheâ€™d be able to dance through his meager attacks and defenses without so much as a secondâ€™s thought.  She held Ragnor in a similar view, although he was greatly more skilled than her spell hurling friend, Cassius knew how to make a sword sing and could weave a tapestry of steel around her foes.  Of course, Ragnorâ€™s blows that actually connected with his targets were another thing altogether.  Her blows were quick, precise, and deliberate, whereas a single blow from Ragnorâ€™s mighty blade could dismember the unwary with one fell strikeâ€¦<br/>
<br/>
Noting that the key was slightly glowing in the fire again, she removed it with her makeshift tongs and set again to refining the edges, using a rock for the anvil and the back of a hand axe for her hammer.  If the pictures she had seen on the maps they had obtained were correct and not mere legends, then this key should unlock the gate they needed to pass through.  If that was the case, then they could enter into their targetâ€™s lair stealthily instead of inviting all the armies of their foe unto themâ€¦<br/>
<br/>
A ringing sound of metal drew her attention just in the nick of time.  She glanced up to see Ableausâ€™ blade spiraling towards her, flipping end over end as it turned about each and every axis.  Almost without thinking her hand darted out and she grasped the blade firmly by the hilt.  Noting how she kept her face staunch and stone-like, she tossed the blade back to Ableaus; her toss making the sword fly like a spear until it almost reached him and then thrusting itself into the earth a mere handâ€™s breadth away from his boots.<br/>
<br/>
Ableaus smiled at her, relieved that he didnâ€™t harm her, and perhaps even more relieved that she didnâ€™t run him through for his clumsiness.  He bowed curtly and again picked up the blade.  Ragnor stood rigid, staring at her.  His body was in a defensive posture, but his face was awash with something between amazement and admiration.  He stared at her, not saying a word, but she could easily tell that he finally realized that she not only has the reflexes of a cat, but that she also knows enough about swords to toss one perfectly.  And anyone that knows anything about swords can tell you that tossing one like that takes skill.  She smiled her seductive smile that is usually reserved for men that she is planning on letting seduce herâ€¦or those that she plans to rob later, and reverted her attention back to the project at handâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In the chapte rthat follows all lines of logic and examples are drawn from the prose, rather than to make an abstract example using "willie the warrior" or "Pete the peasant".  In this way, I hope that the imagination of the reader is engaged rather than some dry textbook examples.<br/>
