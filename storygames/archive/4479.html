Jim Butcher's blog which prompted the scene/sequel thread has a lot of good breakdown of story elements. For example the story skeleton he talks about should look familiar to us:\n<blockquote>*WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENS*, *YOUR PROTAGONIST* *PURSUES A GOAL*. But will he succeed when *ANTAGONIST PROVIDES OPPOSITION*?</blockquote>\nThe <a href="http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://www.musik-therapie.at/PederHill/images/Struct1.gif&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.musik-therapie.at/PederHill/Structure%26Plot.htm&amp;h=285&amp;w=487&amp;sz=7&amp;tbnid=f0wWIidyYMQt2M:&amp;tbnh=75&amp;tbnw=129&amp;prev=/images%3Fq%3Dstory%2Bstructure%26um%3D1&amp;start=2&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=images&amp;ct=image&amp;cd=2" rel="nofollow">three act structure</a>, of course is a go-to concept for writing games.<br/><br/>Another model of the structure of narrative comes from the sociolinguistic work of Labov and Waltezky, who came up with this (partial) analysis of the elements of personal stories:\n<blockquote>(3.1) Definition: An abstract is an initial clause in a narrative that reports the entire sequence of events of the narrative.<br/><br/>(3,2) Definition: An orientation clause gives information on the time, place of the events of a narrative, the identities of the participants and their initial behavior.<br/><br/>(3,3) Definition: A clause of complicating action is a sequential clause that reports a next event in response to a potential question, "And what happened [then]?"<br/><br/>    (3.3.1) Implication: All sequential clauses are clauses of complicating action and all clauses of complicating action are sequential clauses.<br/><br/>(3.4) Definition: A coda is a final clause which returns the narrative to the time of speaking, precluding a potential question, "And what happened then?"</blockquote>\nAnother is Vladimir Propp's analysis of fairy tale structures, which inspired the creation of this <a href="http://www.brown.edu/Courses/FR0133/Fairytale_Generator/home.html" rel="nofollow">fairy tale generator</a>.<br/><br/>Here is the fairy tale I got from choosing "lack", "guidance", "victory", and "difficult task".\n<blockquote>There was a hopelessness that permeated my world, emanating from my skin, soaking into all my organs.  My stomach no longer bothered to call attention to itself.  Instead, it swallowed its growls, seeking nourishment in emptiness.<br/><br/>The woman in dragon scales glided up the mountain and vanished in the mists.  The needle bade me to follow her snow white hairs that glistened like silver strands of dew.<br/><br/>Through the blind frenzy of earth and shadows I plunged my dagger into the creature's heart and watched as it melted into rain.<br/><br/>The bearded man approached me in heavy garb of silk and flower embroidery.  He told me that my tongue would be tested for truth by way of needle.  "If upon the needle's prick your tongue does not bleed you will be telling the truth.  If, however, it does bleed, you are a liar, and hence will swallow poison through your broken tongue."</blockquote>\nAre there are more types of analysis of story out there in literary or other fields that people know about?

As I understand, Burkean analysis proceeds by looking at how the account of a speaker emphasizes or gives priority to some subset of those elements, and the relationships or "ratios" among them.<br/><br/>If you like Propp, though, you should take a look at the work of Algirdas Greimas, whose "Structural Semantics" contains what you'd have to call a systematization or rationalization of Propp's scheme that is rather a tour de force. It culminates in his "actantial mythical model," which I carry around with me just against such need as this. It breaks down a narrative into six elements:<br/><br/>A1 subject<br/>A2 object<br/>A3 sender<br/>A4 receiver<br/>A5 helper<br/>A6 opponent<br/><br/>arranged like this:<br/><br/><br/><code>sender --&gt; object --&gt; receiver<br/>              ^<br/>              |<br/>helper --&gt; subject &lt;-- opponent<br/></code><br/>"This model seems to possess . . . a certain operational value," says Greimas. "Its simplicity lies in the fact that it is entirely centered on the <i>object of desire</i> aimed at by the subject and situated, as <i>object of communication</i>, between the sender and the receiver -- the desire of the subject being, in its part, modulated by projections from the helper and the opponent."<br/><br/>An Arthurian legend would look like this:<br/><br/>A1 the questing knight<br/>A2 the grail<br/>A3 God<br/>A4 King Arthur<br/>A5 his squire, his trusty steed, his faith<br/>A6 Morgana le Fay, his sinful nature<br/><br/>A time travel story might break down like this:<br/><br/>A1 the time traveler<br/>A2 the timestream (the course of actual events)<br/>A3 historical forces<br/>A4 society, civilization<br/>A5 historical or technical knowledge<br/>A6 historical necessity or "ergodicity"<br/><br/>And a narrative of capitalist success (an example I think from Greimas):<br/><br/>A1 investor<br/>A2 investment<br/>A3 economic system<br/>A4 enterprise<br/>A5 vision<br/>A6 uncertainty<br/><br/>It's very neat stuff, and certainly more complex than I can do justice to, even given unlimited space. Luckily, we are told by Fredric Jameson no less, that we are allowed to steal blithely from the work of Greimas and call it "bricolage."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101400">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alan" title="Alan"><img alt="Alan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alan">Alan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101400/#Comment_101400" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-06T03:26:49+00:00" title="October  6, 2007  3:26AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 6, 2007 4:08AM by Alan.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My favorite model of story structure is Dramatica. It has many things to say about the elements of a "grand argument story" -- one that looks at a problem from all angles. Here are a few:<br/>\n<br/>\n- a complete story looks at the story from four angles: <br/>\n   1)What's everyone dealing with?<br/>\n   2)How do I experience it?<br/>\n   3)How do you experience it?<br/>\n   4)What do we deal with together as a result?<br/>\n<br/>\n- each of the four angles on the story goes through 4 signposts, and the 3 acts are strung between the signposts like spans of a suspension bridge:<br/>\nSP1------Act 1-------SP2------Act 2-------SP3------Act31-------SP4<br/>\n<br/>\n- Each story also explores four domains:<br/>\n   - external landscape (situation)<br/>\n   - external action (activity)<br/>\n   - internal landscape (fixed mind)<br/>\n   - internal action (psychology/manipulation)<br/>\n<br/>\nEach of the four perspectives line up with one of the domains -- in a different way depending on the kind of story.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, in Star Wars (1977), the overall story explores the activity of destroying the Death Star; the "I"" story is the situation of Luke, the farmboy stuck in a backwater; the "you" story is fixed mind, Obi Wan confident in the force; the "we" line is psychology, Obi Wan training Luke. In the end, Luke can only destroy the Death Star if he stops trusting skill and technology and trusts the force like Obi Wan has been urging.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn To Kill a Mockingbird, the domains are lined up differently. The overall story explores the fixed mind of prejudice in the trial; the "I"" story is action, Scout doing things a little girl does; the "you" story is psychology, Boo Radley has a strange way of thinking; the "we" story is fixed mind, Scout fears Boo even though she's never met him. In the end, Scout learns her own prejudice when Boo saves her life.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's lots more.

Getting to the narrative issue, there are a handful of researchers that analyze "conversational narratives," i.e. colloquial storytelling.  Among my favorites are <a href="http://www.fawi.net/ezine/vol3no4/LangellierPetersonbk.html" rel="nofollow">Kristin M. Langellier and Eric E. Peterson</a> at the University of Maine.  I don't have my copy of their book with me (it's at work), but I honestly think roleplaying is much more closely related to conversational narrative than it is to written narratives, so there are potentially many lessons to be learned from storytelling forms that are closer to the actual practice of roleplaying (like conversational narratives and improv theatre).<br/><br/>Also, I keep being drawn back to the issue of distinct narrative traditions.  It really depends on what kind of story you want to be telling.  Propp's main thing was analyzing Russian folk tales, so the structural guidelines he developed were very much based on that body of traditions.  Likewise, Joseph Campbell, in developing his body of work on the "hero's journey" and the relationship between humans and gods, was looking heroic myth, a genre of stories that exists in many different cultures.  But before structuralism became a big deal in looking at narrative traditions, there were already "stock" guidelines and character types in many narrative traditions that assisted writers and performers in creating stories that were clearly a part of an established tradition.  Like, if you take a look at Wikipedia's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Theatrical_genres" rel="nofollow">list of theatre genres</a>, you have things like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commedia_dell%27arte" rel="nofollow">commedia dell'arte</a> (the first thing that came to my mind), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_opera" rel="nofollow">Chinese opera</a> (the second one I thought of), passion plays, morality plays, the Theatre of the Absurd, even things like minstrel shows.  All of these are distinct narrative traditions that have very specific guidelines on how to create certain kinds of stories.  So, in addition to looking at academic models of how narratives are structured, there's also a wealth of information on traditions of performance that playwrights, actors, and others use in creating and presenting narratives.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101423">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101423/#Comment_101423" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-06T09:39:19+00:00" title="October  6, 2007  9:39AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Given that I've restructured my game to attempt to follow the three-act structure, I'll be watching this conversation with interest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101456/#Comment_101456" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-06T19:24:04+00:00" title="October  6, 2007  7:24PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you guys so much. I knew there must be more out there, but haven't been able to put my fingers on any of this stuff.<br/><br/>It's a good point, JW, about the context of the story traditions. I'm working on making a notation for diagraming narratives, and what I've come up with so far is most like Greimas' structural semantics, but it is hard to delineate structure when the story gets more complex. Breaking down a tv show is simple and clear, a novel, less so. <br/><br/>Huh. This would be a good opportunity to try out these approaches. <br/><br/>For example, this:\n<blockquote>- Each story also explores four domains:<br/>- external landscape (situation)<br/>- external action (activity)<br/>- internal landscape (fixed mind)<br/>- internal action (psychology/manipulation)</blockquote>\n..reminds me very much of the <a href="http://spione.adept-press.com/forum/comments.php?DiscussionID=137" rel="nofollow">game of Spione</a> I played recently.

Which is actually what action of the story entails. This is easy to overlook since Leia is busy dealing with the opposition of Darth Vader and Luke helps her.
