It uses several dice pools as its core mechanic, but it didn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t occur to me until my last playtest, when I found myself buying a brick of dice specially, that it might use too many dice.<br/><br/>Now don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t get me wrong \xe2\u20ac\u201c we\xe2\u20ac\u2122re not talking thousands of dice here, Exalted style, but we are talking some. Maybe 10 per player, plus a few more for fun? And you\xe2\u20ac\u2122re rarely required to roll them all at once. They\xe2\u20ac\u2122re d6s too, and most people have a fair few of them lying around, especially if they play Warhammer. <br/><br/>In fact, part of the reason Six Bullets uses so many is that it uses dice as its counters and tokens, which could easily be replaced with real tokens. I just like the image and tactility of dice as counters, of grabbing those tokens you\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve been using to measure your gun shooting or vengeance or whatever right off your character sheet and throwing them down on the table to resolve a conflict. Truth be told it excites me a little! And for that I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m prepared to stick by my big brick of d6s.<br/><br/>I sometimes have a problem with Godlike and its many many d10s, but I get over that pretty quickly when I remember how cool the system is. Dogs in the Vineyard uses a lot of dice too, especially the obscurer types, but I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m learning to stock up on d4s and d8s now. <br/><br/>So I guess my question is \xe2\u20ac\u201c is there such a thing as too many dice? Or tokens or counters or whatever? Have you ever picked a game up and read it and gone \xe2\u20ac\u0153urgh, I can\xe2\u20ac\u2122t play this \xe2\u20ac\u201c it uses too many dice!\xe2\u20ac\x9d?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59738">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sempiternity" title="Sempiternity"><img alt="Sempiternity" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.personal.psu.edu/bcp5010/stefan2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sempiternity">Sempiternity</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59738/#Comment_59738" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-07T15:11:10+00:00" title="March  7, 2007  3:11PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 7, 2007 3:13PM by Sempiternity.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm cool with tons of dice, myself - i much prefer having the real objects - dice, counters, dice &amp; counters - right out on the table, where i can see and feel them.

People liked to see them around, and to collect up to 12 of them on their pools. It is a nice feeling to play with them on your hands. They can be a strong, and easy to understand, representation of your game power, narration rights, or whatever you use them for in your game.<br/><br/>The only time I thought it was too much, was when I first read Universalis. It suggests to have at hand around 50 tokens per player if I remember it well. But I finally got pretty much onto it, and it works perfectly.<br/><br/>The only "but" I bring up is: More than a handful of dice may complicate the evaluation of their exact amount by a simple glance.

The more, the better".<br/>\n<br/>\nUsing many dice will probably ensure that nobody who's not already a gamer will play your game, though. I'd estimate that your average non-RPG-player will be able to scavenge something like six or seven dice (more if they have a Yahtzee).

That event did 42D6 Normal damage. Enough to break his nose, and put him in a coma for a week (he also was pretty invulnerable). If you really want to roll for damage to that space shuttle crashing into another going the other way, we could be rolling a looooong time. 52,000 KPH, is somewhere around 500d6 damage. (The first is an actual example, the second only theoretical). Terminal velocity falls for 30D6 are positively commonplace.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother practical example, I'm captaining a Federation Tournament Cruiser in SFB, and my desperation narrow salvo of overloaded photon torps hits! Along with phaser fire, that's 85 points of damage. Which means 85 2d6 Damage rolls (usually made ten at a time, rolling 20D6 with ten pairs of matching colors).<br/>\n<br/>\nOr I'm playing my WH40K Tyranid army, and my big squad of 16 tooled up genestealers and an attached Brood Lord runs into a mass of Space Marines. With the extra scything talons, that's 3 basic attacks, plus one for charging, meaning 64 attacks for the genestealers, and 5 more for the Brood Lord. Let's see, that's 69 dice to hit, probably then 34 hit. 6 of which are likely a 6 and, therefore, rending (which automatically kills the marine, since rending hits automatically wound, and ignore armor), so need not be rolled again, leaving 28 dice rolled to see if wounds occur. Of which 14 dice or so wound and are rolled again for armor saves.<br/>\n<br/>\n(There will probably be 5 failures to save. Add these 5 casualties to the 6 rends, and that's all she wrote for the marine squad. Lesson, never let genestealers get that close. Which is tough, since they're Fleet of Claw. I like 'nids.)<br/>\n<br/>\nOr you're playing Titan (the boardgame), and its the final fight, and your line of 5 serpents has gone up against his 4 colossi. Meaning you roll 90 dice looking for 6's. As we can see from the picture <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://colossus.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">here</a> (along with, apparently, a java version of the game), each colossus takes ten hits, meaning you maybe kill one (if he distribution works out right). The returning 30 dice only need anything but a 1, so do 24 points of damage, and probably take out one Serpent. Back and forth this goes until this one battle is done.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI likes lotsa dice. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59906/#Comment_59906" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-08T09:58:29+00:00" title="March  8, 2007  9:58AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dice are awesome.

I was thinking this morning about it and a way that you could have actual physical boxes for the traits that get passed around.

Since I used that system as a foundation for a small homemade game called Time of the Ancients, I used this rule as well, and it works just fine. Perhaps this'll work out for Six Bullets too, I dunno...<br/>\n<br/>\nYet I gotta say I found it actually strangely amusing during the actual gameplay to roll, say, 43d6 and just add 'em all up (I mean some WW games use lots of dice as well, but with some mind-boggling manipulations on the results). It's fun. Weird, but fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
