I actually just ordered it last night on impulse but I'm slightly worried.  The last time my group played a horror/mystery game was probably 6 years ago and it was VERY traditional.  What I am looking for is advice on running a Mystery game while still maintaining a Narrativist approach and not compromising our group's creative agenda.  I'm not really sure how to do this...do conflict webs work well in Mystery games?  If your group encourages metagaming where is the mystery?  Are mystery games best suited for Simulationist play?<br/>\n<br/>\nAny advice on running a Narrativist mystery game would be greatly appreciated.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144726">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson" title="Ben_Johnson"><img alt="Ben_Johnson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2283/2131054135_2403ed15ce_s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson">Ben_Johnson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144726/#Comment_144726" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-18T08:55:45+00:00" title="May 18, 2008  8:55AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you seen <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=6487&amp;page=1#Item_0" rel="nofollow">this recent thread</a>?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144733">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144733/#Comment_144733" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-18T10:18:35+00:00" title="May 18, 2008 10:18AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 18, 2008 10:23AM by chearns.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Charles, welcome to Story Games.<br/><br/>I don't see why you couldn't have a mystery game with the addressing of premise. I could easily see the following lead to a nar mystery game: the mystery is important to the characters for personal reasons (like my mother is dead, who killed her is personal; to my mind, I'm a detective and this case landed in my lap isn't (although I'll be fired if I don't solve it does make it personal)); it is possible for the characters to not solve the mystery; finding the clues isn't the key, it's what the characters are willing to do to get those clues that matters; are they willing to act on those clues; and are they willing to act on the mystery once it's solved? That kind of situation seems to me like it could lead to some weighty issues being addressed in play. <br/><br/>To my mind the key would be to not have the story be about the mystery, but rather about the characters investigating the mystery.<br/><br/>EDIT: Not saying that would be the optimal way to make a Nar mystery game (where you solve a mystery, which I presume is what you are looking for, thus avoiding games like Dirty Secrets or InSpectres), just tossing out a quick example.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144736">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144736/#Comment_144736" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-18T11:05:40+00:00" title="May 18, 2008 11:05AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing to watch out for, and potentially talk to your players about, is the players getting too focused on the task-based objectives of a mystery.  This is one of those genres where it is way easy to fall back on old habits, including obsessing over the breadcrumb trail to the conclusion.  There are a number of ways to resolve this (including, for two examples, making the breadcrumb trail explicit and unlocked by character development instead of task-resolved steps, or making explicit that there is no breadcrumb trail and indeed no preconceived whodunit ala Dirty Secrets), but it should probably be something that should be addressed, even if it is just talking to your players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144737">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144737/#Comment_144737" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-18T11:50:49+00:00" title="May 18, 2008 11:50AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure about Narrativist or whatever, but if you haven't read it, check out the classic thread <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2910" rel="nofollow">A mystery fan schools you on mystery games</a> featuring the insights of Jason Corley.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144738">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144738/#Comment_144738" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-18T12:10:11+00:00" title="May 18, 2008 12:10PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, what I've found while struggling with not turning Dogs in the Vineyard into a mystery game and our group's <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=26185.0" rel="nofollow">recent foray</a> into narrativist techniques in a game of Con-X is this:<br/><br/>The typical appeal of a mystery game is the suspenseful build-up and the associated release of suspense when all the little pieces fall into place. The traditional techniques of achieving this effect - the GM plans an evul plot and the players play investigators who discover them - means that play will revolve around accomplishing tasks. If the tasks do not get completed in time, the game typically ends as the players have "lost".<br/><br/>In the paragraph above, we already use three techniques which are problematic in Nar play:<br/><br/>1) Pre-planned plot line with little wiggle room for deviation<br/>2) Task rather than conflict style resolution<br/>3) A gauge other than story structure determining pace<br/><br/>So, in Call of Cthulhu, you work from a module which says things like "if the PCs speak with the local sheriff, he will tell them X and Y, and will also reveal Z if they succeed in a Persuasion roll". This trail of breadcrumbs eventually bring the PCs to a show-down where they hopefully possess enough arcane knowledge to defeat the monsters without suffering TPI (Total Party Insanity). Since the plot cannot be advanced unless the PCs succeed at tasks, this is what players tend to focus their efforts on - spending time on things like interpersonal conflicts and wrestling with inner demons is counterproductive to beating the GM's module. If the players do not get all their ducks lined up in time, perhaps the town will be suddenly overrun by Deep Ones or Hastur starts speaking through the village priest - not because of bangs which alter the momentum of the story but still retains story structure, but because the players failed to accomplish something and now have to suffer the consequences.<br/><br/>Compare Dogs in the Vineyard, which on the surface encourages the GM to create a mystery by way of town creation. Who is prideful and how? What sin did that cause? What followed? What manner of corruption of the Faith was caused? Who is the sorcerer preaching the false ways? None of this is apparent to the Dogs as they enter the town - as in CoC, they get leads (a bunch of people giving the Dogs their own version of what needs to be done) and the rest is up to them.<br/><br/>So where are the differences?<br/><br/>Planning: In CoC, planning goes into what <i>will come</i>, including the clues the players will find and a timeline for the evul plot. In DitV, planning goes into <i>what has come before</i> the Dogs entered the town - these events are meant to assist the GM in moving forward, by extrapolating possible motivations for the various NPCs and to ensure there are coherent relationships between them, but never to say "if <i>this</i>, then <i>that</i>".<br/><br/>Play focus: The Dogs will often be played as if they're trying really hard to figure out what's going on, who's at fault, and how to set things right - but really, the players know (or should know) that there is rarely a true solution to be discovered - no magical incantation to send the demons back to hell, if only you could piece the scroll fragments together accurately. This means the players are less focused on "tasks" and more on "conflicts", since succeeding at "tasks" have no particular purpose in the game while the outcome of a "conflict" can take the story in a brand new direction. It can also give the player a better idea of how she would like to judge the town, not because of the revelation of a secret but because the player's own perception changes.<br/><br/>Story structure: In CoC, all the clues the players can find combines to spell out a clear solution to the story. Because of this, the distribution of clues determine story pace. Since there will never be a clear solution to the puzzle presented by town creation in DitV, the players are invited to "solve the puzzle" anytime and in any way they like. This gives them freedom to explore or create dramatic opportunities in the town without having to worry about derailing the plot or missing a deadline. If one overlaid a preplanned plot and timeline onto DitV, the story may appear incoherent - the system encourages players to engage with and invest emotional capital into NPCs who may never play an important part because they weren't written into the GM's plot.<br/><br/>Despite some surface similarities, the two games clearly serve two very different agendas, which I witnessed when trying to run DitV in my default mystery mode. So, really, I have no good solutions for you, just acknowledgments of the problem.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144742/#Comment_144742" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-18T13:23:22+00:00" title="May 18, 2008  1:23PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 18, 2008 1:23PM by John_Harper.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe play a session or two of <a href="http://www.indiepressrevolution.com/xcart/product.php?productid=16347&amp;cat=0&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">Dirty Secrets</a> or <a href="http://www.indiepressrevolution.com/xcart/product.php?productid=16261&amp;cat=0&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">InSpectres</a> while you wait for Trail of Cthulhu to arrive.

Perhaps you've got a deathwish; perhaps you've got a lust for power; perhaps it's in the blood.<br/><br/>So it's quite possible to run Trail of Cthulhu to address the premise "What drives you to investigate this shit?". The beautiful thing is, since it's Cthulhu mythos, you can guarantee that the answer to the mystery will destroy the character rather than satisfy the Drive. (Look for the optional rule "The Big Reveal").<br/><br/>The thing with Trail of Cthulhu is that, since the mystery is guaranteed to be revealed, the game must be about <i>something</i> else than the mystery. So you can play Sim, and make the game about exploring the world; or play Nar, and make the game "You'll discover the mystery, but what will it do to you?".<br/><br/>Also, I feel I should mention that I'm releasing a murder mystery game later in the year, called A Taste For Murder.

Ellroy's work is a cesspit of corruption and obsession. More conventionally, Chandler and McDonald only work if the investigator can pass moral judgment on the goings-on (and this is where Dirty Secrets' roots are.)  A step sideways in the spy/thriller genre and the morality-play nature is on full display in many works, though typically it's hyperconservative, imperialist, or, especially in the classics, racist and/or sexist moral statements that are made.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144774">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144774/#Comment_144774" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-19T00:41:22+00:00" title="May 19, 2008 12:41AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I guess my main doubts about the game were whether you could tell a coherent session of Narrativist play in Trail of Cthulhu or whether it encouraged incoherent play.

As the GM, you ruthlessly attack the player's Drives and let them decide whether they crumble. For example, if there's someone who's driven to investigate the Mythos for academic glory, have his academic reputation crumble as his colleagues, reading his published work, think he's going insane. If someone's driven to investigate the Mythos for power, let him realise that the Mythos will control him, rather than vice versa.<br/><br/>One point about Trail of Cthulhu is that it's not a tightly-focussed indie game, as Inspectres is. If you want to play Nar with Trail, you need to make some choices about how you run the game: you won't be doing much combat, for example, and you'll probably be focussing on Drives a lot.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144814/#Comment_144814" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-19T08:22:44+00:00" title="May 19, 2008  8:22AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: agony</cite>I'll have to check out Dirty Secrets.</blockquote>\nFYI, I'm the designer of <i>Dirty Secrets</i>.

During the scenario, the killer ends up getting to a couple of their friends, too. They discover that the killer is an escaped ex-con the cop put behind bars some years ago, and eventually corner the bastard in an alley, guns in hand. Does the principled cop want justice, even now? Would vengeance satisfy more? Is his career worth the sacrifice? What if the brother wants vengeance and he doesn't? What do they do?<br/><br/>Presuming you have those kinds of choices set up to make, Gumshoe can get there fairly reliably because the clue-finding is a non-issue. For inspiration, I highly recommend Dev Purkayastha's "Exit Music", which is a scenario he wrote for Precis Intermedia Games' and can be downloaded from their website.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_145228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145228/#Comment_145228" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-20T20:34:08+00:00" title="May 20, 2008  8:34PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Would it be possible to put together a game where thematic choices are made between <i>unraveling the mystery</i> and holding on to your morality/humanity?
