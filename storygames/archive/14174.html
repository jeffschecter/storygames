Thought so.<br/><br/>How'd you like a second chance?<br/><br/><b>Introducing GAME SOUS-CHEF.</b><br/><br/>Your mission: <b>take a unfinished game that you started making for a competition, and make something you can submit out of it - or tell us why it was better to leave the thing for dead</b>.<br/><br/><b>Why do it</b><br/><br/>Because starting a new thing is often easier than seeing it through. Because cleaning out old skeletons is therapeutic. Because sometimes that old idea form four years ago really was a good one. Because we can learn from our old mistakes, or laugh at them to see how far we've come.<br/><br/>Because sometimes, it's good to do a favour for that past self of yours, who had a beautiful idea crushed under the grim wheels of Circumstance and Ennui.<br/><br/><b> How will it work?</b><br/><br/>First, find an old idea of your for a previous competition. Maybe you had a half finished text. Maybe just a few  sketchy thoughts on paper. Maybe it was just the faintest inkling of an idea. Doesn't matter. Dig it up.<br/><br/>Suck your teeth and weigh value. Does it just need some polish, maybe a playtest? Do sections need rewriting? Is one concept, one mechanic worth saving but the rest embarrassing juvenilia? Doesn't matter. Make the call.<br/><br/>THEN:<br/><br/>EITHER<br/><br/>1) FINISH HIM! Get that thing written up, and send it to edronwards@gmail.com. Pretty or rough-edged as you like. I'll give you a month - let's face it, we know that a week or two wasn't enough for you last time - so entries in by <b>MIDNIGHT GMT, FRIDAY 27TH MAY</b>. Although to be honest, I'll read it either way.<br/><br/>OR<br/><br/>2) LAY IT TO REST. Write a post-mortem of the never-to-be-finished game. Talk about what worked, what didn't work, what you can take from it, what should be left to die in the desert sands. Email it to edronwards@gmail.com, and in exchange, I will tell you that you did, indeed, finish this game, and you may go forward with your spirit lifted.<br/><br/>If you start out wanting 1 and it turns into 2, that's cool. If it starts out as 2 and ends up being 1, so much the cooler.<br/><br/>Either way, come end of May, one little unfinished corner of your brain will achieve that blessed closure.<br/><br/><b>Who's with me?</b><br/><br/>LIST OF KNOWN PARTICIPANTS<br/><br/>Thomas "Meserach" Lawrence - <i>Baroque</i> - <a href="http://meserach.wordpress.com" rel="nofollow">Baroque Development Blog</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_321676">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Erik_Battle" title="Erik_Battle"><img alt="Erik_Battle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Erik_Battle">Erik_Battle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321676/#Comment_321676" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-24T20:54:46+00:00" title="April 24, 2011  8:54PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good idea!  I will probably do this as there are quite a few I never entered.<br/><br/>However...when I read the title I was more interested.  When I think of Sous-Chef...that's someone that helps out the Chef.  So, I was thinking, there's probably people who would enjoy working on someone else's game (maybe writing, coming up with numbers/mechanics, layout, etc).  Some designers (like Harper) seem quite good at all aspects, but others of us are only good at one or two things. <br/><br/>Me, I rarely finish a Game Chef game because I come up with an idea, but mechanically it just never works.  I'm really bad with numbers (abysmally bad, in fact).  So, to design a system myself just does not work well.  But, there are others that are great with math.  That kind of thing.<br/><br/>What would be neat is if you said, Why didn't you finish your Game Chef entry?  If it's because you are inept or intimidated by something in the design process, let's see if someone else can help.<br/><br/>Just a thought.  I'm still up for the original idea though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_321689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321689/#Comment_321689" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-25T06:00:51+00:00" title="April 25, 2011  6:00AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like this idea!
