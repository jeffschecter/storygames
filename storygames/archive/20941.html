Often games are seen as merely entertainment, but I'm sure a lot of us agree that in the indie space especially there's a lot more going on underneath (or sometimes its right on top.)<br/><br/>It's something I've been asking myself now with the games I'm working on.

I love it.<br/><br/>For me RPGs are thoroughly an artistic medium, and therefore a medium for "challenging social ills", as you say. The basic function is discourse among the participant artists, which I believe to act akin to the Force: it surrounds us, permeates us and ultimately, anchors and guides us as human beings. Good art - a good roleplaying game - will bring us into discourses that have positive impact for us as human beings.<br/><br/>There is also another sense to the idea: one could say that my answer above is wishy-washy in that I merely describe what art does <i>by definition</i>, yet I do not commit to any particular Truth about the universe in it. What about actually fighting fascism, where did that go? The propaganda function, so to speak?<br/><br/>My answer in that regard is that roleplaying games are not a very good propaganda vehicle due to how much personal interpretation and thinking things out is necessarily involved; the closest you get is basically by having the GM come to the table with an agenda, but even that's pretty weak-sauce when compared to the propaganda effect of a good (well-designed) movie. A movie can draw a person towards or away from e.g. fascism much better than a roleplaying game can, thanks to the inherent nature of the medium. All passive-audience arts are strictly superior to roleplaying for propaganda, I think.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I still think that good art - good discourse - fights fascism simply because there is much in fascism that is not true. <i>Any</i> human activity that encourages wisdom will, therefore, necessarily be anti-fascist in the sense of enabling its practitioners to resist fascist lies. Insofar as your game discusses fascism, and insofar as fascism cannot withstand close scrutiny, the play of the game will be successfully anti-fascist.<br/><br/>Of course not all rpgs do this as well; you can even make a pro-fascism rpg (D&amp;D for instance is a good candidate) by focusing the game's necessary dialogues on issues and concerns upon which fascism <i>does</i> have relevant values and lessons for the players. To get a solid anti-fascist rpg the best plan, therefore, is to delve deep into the issues - not merely the talking points the fascist wants, but also the ones where his worldview is weak. Let the players consider the entire picture and make up their own minds. I believe that fascism will not, overall, stand such careful consideration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459532">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kyleweems" title="kyleweems"><img alt="kyleweems" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/856/nI5M0EM1PN1HG.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kyleweems">kyleweems</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459532/#Comment_459532" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-23T21:45:29+00:00" title="January 23, 2017  9:45PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 23, 2017 9:46PM by kyleweems.">edited January 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I am disconcerted by the title of this thread.

That's a question I've often been asking myself over the last 10 years or so, since I've been maturing a political consciousness &amp; conscience.\n<blockquote>[WHAT A GREAT POST]</blockquote>\nOverall, my take is similar to Eero's. I believe any sufficiently thoughtful work of art helps fight fascism by prompting people to think, as fascism and thought are antithetical.<br/>Furthermore, RPGs aren't just any piece of art, they're an active participation medium based on conversation as the core technology. This makes role-playing an inherently very good activity at training people into thinking for themselves <i>and</i> interacting peacefully as a group towards common-grounds ends. They're inherently democratic and - according to, for example, <a href="http://osterskov.dk/" rel="nofollow">\xd8sterskov Efterskole</a> - help people develop strong critical thinking abilities.<br/><br/>Contrary to that, though, there's been a lot of fascist-leaning <i>content</i> in RPGs, historically: celebration of violence, weapon fetish, unquestioned venture capitalism, thinly-veiled colonialist narratives, the de-humanization of the "other", etc. Plus, a culture of play that more often than not reacted against the inherent democratic qualities of the medium, such as enshrining a cult of the almighty and infallible GM, or emphasizing all sorts of competitiveness within nominally non-competitive games.<br/><br/>The net end results is that RPGs can easily be as much <i>fascist by default</i> as they're <i>antifascist by default</i>, and I'm not sure whether it evens out. The default is unreliable.<br/><br/>My games strive to fight fascism by questioning or outright eschewing fascist-leaning content and techniques, by playing to the strengths of the medium and by developing a fascism-free local culture of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459552/#Comment_459552" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-24T11:53:25+00:00" title="January 24, 2017 11:53AM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll say a few words about my long-running D&amp;D campaign here, because it has at times been perceived as fascist by Internet strangers, and because I think it's an interesting example of the tension between fascism and liberalism that Rafu notes, and how that can play out at the table.<br/><br/>The premise of the campaign for six or seven years now has been "historical fantasy, with hardcore Gamist challenge". What this basically boils down to is a setting that is a historical as we care to make it (that is, we don't stop play for minutiae, but in principle all setting questions are resolved with historical lore), combined with all sorts of D&amp;D insanity occurring as exceptions to the historical norm: magic does not exist <i>except</i> for apparently <i>this</i> character, <i>this</i> dungeon, <i>this</i> obscure order of monk-sorcerers. Basically like Solomon Kane and similar fantasy stories. Play has wandered over the years around the 14th to 17th centuries, mostly in Europe, with the occasional jaunt to exotic colonial lands. (Currently we're campaigning weekly in 1361 AD in central Sweden.) Low to mid-level, as we play so tight in terms of procedure, with no give from the GM side at all in terms of success and failure, that even getting to 2nd level is a major achievement.<br/><br/>Now, what I describe above will in practice mean a campaign full of precisely the kind of content that tends to be considered politically retrograde: player characters are generally members of dominant ethnic and social groups (with the unavoidable unique snowflakes, of course), NPCs express historically realistic attitudes towards all sorts of things, and thus values such as colonialism, religious bigotry, racism and sexism (this last one interestingly very, very rarely towards PCs - the PC groups tend to be situated to shelter female PCs from possible consequences of flouting the gender norms of society) are regularly encountered as matter of play, from both sides of the table: a player may be inspired to roleplay their character, which is affirmed by the GM as being appropriate behavior and expected by the NPCs in the setting; the GM may likewise illustrate the social system in the scenario by having NPCs act in period-appropriate ways, which sometimes means casual cruelty and inhumanity of various sorts.<br/><br/>(Anybody familiar with the tv drama <i>The Knick</i> probably has a pretty good sense of what all this looks like as an aesthetic gestalt. It's an American hospital drama set in New York in the year 1900, with the delightfully awful premise of showing the setting in as it "really" was, regardless of the delicate sensibilities of the audience. If anything, the show might overemphasize the horrid features of the epoch due to its hospital perspective and stylistic reasons.)<br/><br/>So here we are, positively wallowing in the societal ills of yesteryear. As an added bonus, the strictly Gamist creative agenda of the exercise largely means that the actual play procedure does nothing to problematize or contextualize the events of play: there is no force in the game that would ensure that good triumphs or evil does not; often an oppressive feudal aristocracy or a thoroughly bigoted church hierarchy ends up being the closest thing to "good" in various scenarios involving cannibal monsters from underground. Equally often there is no clear moral dimension to the proceedings, it's just the way of life for conflict to erupt, providing opportunities for unscrupulous individuals such as the player characters to enrich themselves or the political causes they happen to champion.<br/><br/>This next part you'll have to take on faith, because I have actually been sitting in the 200+ sessions of play that I'm describing here, and you haven't. Alternatively, you might just decide that I do not know what I'm talking about. Either way:<br/><br/>My experience of how the arguably fascist content of play in a mockumentary-like D&amp;D campaign like this plays out is that in the long term it increases the political awareness of the players, and makes them somewhat more empathetic towards the weak of society. If anything, the overall pedagogical effect seems to be somewhat socialist in that the harsh, unromantized light the game casts upon "the good old times" tends to make everybody reflect more on what, really, are the building-blocks of a primitive authoritarian society, and how the societal forces that uphold the tapestry have their origins in cruel necessity and human suffering. Players are often in the boots of the very people enacting cruel, discriminatory thinking ("The only good orc is a dead orc" and so on), which is often cause for ironic commentary from the players; in general the players will usually understand <i>why</i> their characters think the way they do, while also realizing how deeply entangled they are in the socio-cultural web that predetermines much about their beliefs, attitudes and the very social toolbox they have access to in figuring out how to resolve their problems. In all the entire exercise looks to us, the players, like a grand historical tragedy more than some sort of wish-fulfillment fantasy about how great it would be if you were the guy with the sword in a world of hapless peasants.<br/><br/>One could argue that players who understand better why the bishop is such a thorough asshole about religious freedom will be more prone to support bigotry in the real world (because they have more of a grounding in how and why religious monoculture was upheld in medieval Europe in the first place), but as I described earlier, I don't really think that this is how humans work: understanding how things work makes you <i>less</i> likely to support non-applicable solutions of yesteryear, not more. If you understand why religious liberty was so feared in the medieval times, and how it was necessarily "good" in all situations, you also have a good chance to realize and appreciate how those same societal concerns do not apply in a world of nation states like the one we live in now. Learning occurs, and everybody participating in the game ends up on a more even keel as citizens in the long run.<br/><br/>These kinds of experiences have convinced me over the years about my let's say liberal stance on the content of roleplaying games. In recent years it has become fashionable to elevate explicitly propagandist games (I do not intend "propaganda" as a slur here, merely a description of what's going on) while "problematizing" other games on strictly superficial basis, based on things like whether the game's setting is sufficiently multicultural. I think that this is an insufficient basis on which to attempt to understand the learning and social conditioning occurring in roleplaying games: there are ironic levels of understanding going on in games, and you can't simply read the political values of a game from its character creation rules. The fact that a game features e.g. racism in the content of play is not, alone, sufficient proof that play of the game advocates for and affirms the racist attitudes of its players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459553/#Comment_459553" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-24T12:46:28+00:00" title="January 24, 2017 12:46PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 24, 2017 12:49PM by Rafu.">edited January 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>understanding how things work makes you <i>less</i> likely to support non-applicable solutions of yesteryear, not more.</blockquote>\nI was trained as a scholar of history, thus I tend to emphatically support this view - that understanding our past, critically and realistically, makes us less vulnerable individuals to manipulation and populist propaganda. While a romantic, idealized past was always a core tool of fascist rhetorics, my first-hand experience is that those who are more enthusiastic about such rhetorics (both in the audience and up on the soapbox) usually possess very little actual historical knowledge.\n<blockquote>there are ironic levels of understanding going on in games, and you can't simply read the political values of a game from its character creation rules.

That's as obvious as inherent sexism was obvious when people introduced such (thankfully half-forgotten) rules as the "Woman" character class, or different attribute modifiers for males and females.<br/>Maybe those were just unexamined, purely reflexive racist views (I'm not necessarily affirming that Arneson and Gygax were fascists - I have no clue) but nonetheless the success of such rules over the decades - making them a tradition or "default" of RPGs - represents a problematic, inherently racist trend within our hobby --- something you have to actively push against if you don't want to be reflexively propagating it.<br/><br/>(I have of course no idea whether you, personally, are using separate rules for elves and dwarves or whatever in your own campaigns. Even if you did, I understand those would be there as an artifact of RPG design from the past, and the attitude of ironic distance you wrote about - the actual attitude of players - looks to me much more important than the details of the ruleset being used.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459554/#Comment_459554" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-24T14:04:00+00:00" title="January 24, 2017  2:04PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I certainly use separate rules for elves and dwarves and such - trolls as a practical example from the Scandinavian leg of the campaign. The desire is for a dramatic mechanical differentiation between the worlds of the human and the alien, and to provide an exoticized sense of otherness to the non-human characters when they are played.<br/><br/>My sense of Gygax is that he probably was a little bit fascist - or romantic of the colonialist era, if one prefers. Probably not so much politically, but emotionally; his work has a consistent sense of yearning for heroic adventure, after all, the kind that only exists in fiction, and it seems that he never questioned the basic proposition. The picaresque stylings in some of his stuff come closest (the rogue novel as a literary genre is pretty ironic, after all), but the way I read it, he enjoyed the cynical machismo of it more than any antiestablishmentarianism. For him, the vivacious, independent adventurer <i>was</i> the establishment he celebrated, and Alignment (an authoritative top-down morality) was the moral underpinning.<br/><br/>I agree in general that D&amp;D does a consistently good job of systematically representing a fascist world view in an epic scope. For me this is specifically why it makes for such a good anti-fascist vehicle - it shows us this world, what it looks and feels like inside <i>The Myth of the Twentieth Century</i>. The discourse I mentioned earlier, that RPGs engender - when it comes to D&amp;D, it is a discourse on fascism in its widest sense. The wonderful absurdity, the points on which it is incisive, as well as the ones where it fails when confounded by real-world sensibility; it's all in there, played out in the adventures of Gygax's little fighting miniatures.<br/><br/>It comes as no surprise that I find the most boring kind of D&amp;D imaginable in the cleaned up corporate version. The biggest sin for me, speaking as an artist, is the relentless effort at historical distance: when you remove the attempts at realism from D&amp;D and proffer it as harmless wish-fulfillment (instead of the "serious wargaming" that it might be viewed as, too), it loses its intellectual honesty, and you really <i>are</i> left with something resembling an unquestioning propaganda vehicle for fascism.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459557">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kyleweems" title="kyleweems"><img alt="kyleweems" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/856/nI5M0EM1PN1HG.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kyleweems">kyleweems</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459557/#Comment_459557" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-24T16:29:33+00:00" title="January 24, 2017  4:29PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Kudos to the OP for the really cool question.

I'm just passing on the great question I heard, and I'm glad it's seeing traction.\n<blockquote><br/>Overall, my take is similar to Eero's. I believe any sufficiently thoughtful work of art helps fight fascism by prompting people to think, as fascism and thought are antithetical.<br/>Furthermore, RPGs aren't just any piece of art, they're an active participation medium based on conversation as the core technology. This makes role-playing an inherently very good activity at training people into thinking for themselves <i>and</i> interacting peacefully as a group towards common-grounds ends. They're inherently democratic and - according to, for example, <a href="http://osterskov.dk/" rel="nofollow">\xd8sterskov Efterskole</a> - help people develop strong critical thinking abilities.<br/></blockquote>\nIn general I would agree, although I could argue that the player makeup of some game tables sometimes contribute to reinforcing bad behavior as they normalize and reinforce biases. E.G. put a bunch of racists at a table and they probably won't RP themselves away from their racism.\n<blockquote><br/>Contrary to that, though, there's been a lot of fascist-leaning <i>content</i> in RPGs, historically: celebration of violence, weapon fetish, unquestioned venture capitalism, thinly-veiled colonialist narratives, the de-humanization of the "other", etc. Plus, a culture of play that more often than not reacted against the inherent democratic qualities of the medium, such as enshrining a cult of the almighty and infallible GM, or emphasizing all sorts of competitiveness within nominally non-competitive games.<br/><br/>The net end results is that RPGs can easily be as much <i>fascist by default</i> as they're <i>antifascist by default</i>, and I'm not sure whether it evens out. The default is unreliable.<br/></blockquote>\nI agree completely. There's several games I can think of, especially by some of the major vendors in the 80's and 90's (but not limited to those) that reinforce certain mindsets, usually through a lack of questioning inherent biases but probably sometimes deliberately so.\n<blockquote><br/>My games strive to fight fascism by questioning or outright eschewing fascist-leaning content and techniques, by playing to the strengths of the medium and by developing a fascism-free local culture of play.</blockquote>\nI think that's awesome <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459561">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459561/#Comment_459561" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-24T18:55:44+00:00" title="January 24, 2017  6:55PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd be wary of equating violence in RPGs with fascism.

Yearning for an imagined past, civilizations in decay, encroaching enemies who are either literally inhuman or else dehumanized...

I have a weeknight D&amp;D game that I am currently DMing. It seems to me that some posters are implying that if my group changed out content in that game, or perhaps switched to another game system, that would be fighting fascism or perhaps opposing other social ills. <br/><br/>Personally, I don't feel that details of this game's content have a significant political effect. <br/><br/>I do feel like the game itself enables dialog between me and the players, and we express ourselves through the game. We get to know each other and our takes on things. But if I switched to playing Night Witches instead of D&amp;D, I'm not convinced that there would be a significant political effect. I think the most significant effect is the communication of the humans at the table. <br/><br/>Do other posters think that if I switched to a different game with my group, that there could be significant political good done? <br/>\n<blockquote>Contrary to that, though, there's been a lot of fascist-leaning <i>content</i> in RPGs, historically: celebration of violence, weapon fetish, unquestioned venture capitalism, thinly-veiled colonialist narratives, the de-humanization of the "other", etc. Plus, a culture of play that more often than not reacted against the inherent democratic qualities of the medium, such as enshrining a cult of the almighty and infallible GM, or emphasizing all sorts of competitiveness within nominally non-competitive games.</blockquote>\nI don't think things like imaginary violence, non-democratic structures, or competition correspond to fascism at all. For example, revolutionary content often has a celebration of violence - imagery of rising up to fight the power. A lot of modern progressive have adopted violent anti-fascist imagery like Wonder Woman punching out nazis. Likewise, I don't think that non-democratic social structures like a classroom, sports team, or corporation are inherently fascist; nor is competition. <br/><br/>By the logic here, playing on a baseball team is fascist-leaning given a non-democratic coach and competition with other teams. <br/><br/>I can analyze content for similarity to real-world fascism, and find a bunch of potential parallels - just as I can draw parallels between Hitler and just about any political figure or movement. Those comparisons may be true and valid, but they are also a stretch. <br/>\n<blockquote>Which is not, of course, to say that D&amp;D is explicitly fascist, that other games don't have the same or similar ideas, that if you like these things that you are a proto-fascist, or anything else of the sort. I'm just supporting the idea that you don't need to do a whole lot of work to make D&amp;D a vessel for understanding fascism (or even promoting it), if you are so inclined.</blockquote>\nI would agree that it is easy to incorporate fascist ideas into D&amp;D. In my weekday evening D&amp;D game, I have joked about ethnic cleansing of goblins and such. I could easily see taking these references and building more out of them. And that could be interesting, or it could just be gross. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459576/#Comment_459576" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-25T09:45:45+00:00" title="January 25, 2017  9:45AM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jim, that's not what I meant.

This is straight-up Jungian stuff.  Defeating such a creature in combat may be a cathartic experience or even breakthrough material (if there's enough bleed going on).  The desire to defeat them (or drag them into the light) is a healthy and normal response to such symbols.<br/><br/>Things get a little trickier when we begin discussing violence to humans, although - just like the logic of dreams or movies - the character the Players oppose is usually a pretty obvious symbol of something bad, at least bad for them.  A Player's response to an NPC is more psychological/archetypal than physical/judgmental.  I've never felt that any of my Players, in any of my games, ever, were working out of a racist hatred that substituted a fictional culture for a real one.

Nobody should like <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23Fascism&amp;Mode=like">#Fascism</a>. So why don't we fight <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23Fascism&amp;Mode=like">#Fascism</a> with game design! What could possibly go wrong?<br/><br/>Well...<br/><br/>We don't have a clear definition for it, and arriving at one in a community that still argues over what an RPG is would be yet another unwinnable ideological battle taking energy away from any real solutions. So we can't <i>designate</i> a game as Anti-Fascist.<br/><br/>We don't understand what <i>causes</i> it. The closest we've come is research done by people like Philip Zimbardo which links <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23Fascist&amp;Mode=like">#Fascist</a> behavior to groupthink <i>regardless of ideology</i>. So we can't <i>determine</i> if a game is Anti-Fascist.<br/><br/>So if we can't agree on a definition or determine how effectively a game achieves that goal, what exactly is the point of the question beyond establishing a moral criteria for game design (and <i>the people who play them</i>) based on a whole bucketload of unevaluated assumptions? And exactly when has <i>that</i> ever been a good thing?<br/><br/>But for argument sake lets say none of the above applies. You're still left with the problem of how to convey a clear moral message when that depends <i>on the choices the players make</i>. Now you could punish the wrong choices, but that rarely leads to the desired change in behavior. And you could make the wrong choices impossible, but then no change in behavior is required. But if you don't let players arrive at their own conclusions about a thing then the message won't be meaningful to them, because it's not a matter of demonstrating what is true but <i>changing what is valued</i>.<br/><br/>In short, no matter how well designed, an RPG cannot be used to send a consistent political message. Not should, but cannot, in that it's a practical impossibility. And any system which would be effective for such would be tantamount to <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23Fascism&amp;Mode=like">#Fascism</a> itself. So just make your game about powerful experiences meaningful to you, and trust your players enough to make their own choices.\n<blockquote>I believe any sufficiently thoughtful work of art helps fight fascism by prompting people to think, as fascism and thought are antithetical.</blockquote>\nIn that case <i>all</i> my games are Anti-Fascist, as is every single RPG I've ever played.<br/><br/>But does that mean a game which presents a single simplified ideology <i>promotes</i> <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23Fascism&amp;Mode=like">#Fascism</a>, even if that ideology is one based on love and kindness?\n<blockquote>understanding how things work makes you <i>less</i> likely to support non-applicable solutions of yesteryear, not more.</blockquote>\nSo how would you make sure a game about <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23Fascism&amp;Mode=like">#Fascism</a> conveys the proper understanding and leads to the right conclusions?<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%23TheIronDream&amp;Mode=like">#TheIronDream</a>\n<blockquote>understanding our past, critically and realistically, makes us less vulnerable individuals to manipulation and populist propaganda.

Thus, a game that does an in-depth "discourse" (I mean an experience of play, of course) on the matter seems warranted.<br/><br/>Were I making the game you suggest, one that would be likely lead people away from fascism, I would probably delve into and hit hard on the fundamental issue of authority in a time of crisis: a game that allows the players a viewpoint into how humans, and large groups of humans, think and act under perceived and real stress conditions.<br/><br/>In my life experience fascism has been particularly credible to people who do not appreciate the virtue of withholding judgement; who rely on simple black-and-white moral narratives; who put great faith into decisive action in times of crisis. My game would delve into the kinds of situations where this kind of thinking is most relevant. I hope it is obvious that I would not prescribe particular conclusions; just an honest opportunity for the players to ponder upon the limits of what fascism (probably not by name, of course) can accomplish for them in various types of situations. Fascism, and of course other modes of thought as well - the same game would presumably allow the players to compare and contrast the virtues of e.g. selflessness, egalitarianism, democracy, anarchism and other such ideas, too; after all, we're interested in finding out what works and where, and that's difficult if we have just fascist ideas everywhere all the time.<br/><br/>Hopefully, when well designed, my game would not be particularly sermonizing or even superficially political; it would simply empower the players to learn some life lessons about the strengths and perils of fascist thought. In my experience your average fascist does not really want <i>outcomes</i> that are that different from anybody's wishes for themselves and the world; they merely believe that a different set of complex societal dynamics is the essential one for achieving that good world. A game like this should be capable of making an anti-fascist a little bit more fascist (by showing them how, in certain conditions, fascist thinking can be the right choice), and the fascist a good deal less so.<br/><br/>In practical terms I'm seeing perhaps a lightly romanticized historical game about the Roman empire during the crisis of the 3rd century. A political drama potentially spanning several generations of movers and shakers of Rome, where the players get to struggle cooperatively - or not so much - for the betterment of their kin, state and civilization. Plus they'll determine the fate of the Empire, of course. That seems like a backdrop that, when combined with the appropriate game mechanics, would forefront the theme quite well. The topic does well in that it's not very propagandistic in any simple way; this is not a milieu where all fascism is trivially wrong about everything. Rather, even the liberal player actually gets to think about what kinds of political and life choices are moral and practical in a setting that is far enough distant from ours that it is more of a philosophical case study than a violent argument about modern day politics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459627/#Comment_459627" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-26T14:20:13+00:00" title="January 26, 2017  2:20PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I've certainly have games that feature complex morality and difficult choices because that can be fun and interesting, but I am with Anon, that I don't honestly believe that is going to change the ways my players think. And honestly, if I did believe that, then I think you are getting into the territory of brainwashing or propagandizing (which itself is kind of fascist). So I think the contradiction Anon points out is quite valid. Either it works, and you yourself become fascist by using the game as a way to change how people think, or it doesn't work and you vilify games as fascist that are doing nothing wrong. There is a lot of hubris behind the idea that I as a GM or as a game designer am going to get people to think correctly. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459631">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kyleweems" title="kyleweems"><img alt="kyleweems" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/856/nI5M0EM1PN1HG.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kyleweems">kyleweems</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459631/#Comment_459631" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-26T17:53:58+00:00" title="January 26, 2017  5:53PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a quick aside, this article touches on the topic of how D&amp;D pre-labels many of its non-human races as "evil", making it a prior assumption that killing them is just what you do.

The themes of WWII games - including Night Witches - often include nationalism, military heroism, glorification of violence, and dehumanization of the Other. In short, it's heroic to kill Nazis because they're evil. It seems easy to turn heroically killing Nazis for your country into a game that encourages fascism. <br/><br/>That doesn't mean that WWII games are bad. I just don't think that killing Nazis in a WWII game is generally more anti-fascist than killing orcs in a Tolkien game. \n<blockquote>As a quick aside, this article touches on the topic of how D&amp;D pre-labels many of its non-human races as "evil", making it a prior assumption that killing them is just what you do.

When I'm playing in a WWII game gunning down Nazis, it's a prior assumption that killing is what I do. Is that really better than staking vampires or cutting down orcs for being evil? <br/><br/>WWII games aren't my favorite genre, but I've enjoyed them and don't think there's anything wrong with them. However, I'm not at all convinced that killing Nazis in a WWII game with my friends does anything to fight fascism in the real world. <br/><br/>As a contrasting example, I ran for a while an alternate 1950s Call of Cthulhu game - where the U.S., UK, Japan, and Nazi Germany were all allies against the Deep Ones. Fighting alongside Nazis was uncomfortable in a way I thought was interesting.

I don't have an issue with games doing this if people want that, but to equate the game system or the play style with political systems and ideologies seems pretty specious. I don't think doing things like giving everyone equal spotlight time, or giving players powers usually reserved for the GM, makes anyone better people, or fights a tyrannical system of government. And the reverse certainly isn't true either. I know plenty of players who enjoy competitive approaches where spotlight time isn't assured, and none of them are remotely fascist or interested in fascism. I just do not see any causation between game system and whether you are fighting fascism.  even if you could show some kind of correlation between system and politics, that doesn't mean there is a direct causal link by any stretch. Few of us are even qualified to give a public lecture on fascism let alone design games that somehow fight fascism. I think we need to be honest about what we can assert as game designers and not confuse ourselves with people who do real things to change the world.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459684">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459684/#Comment_459684" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-28T16:18:25+00:00" title="January 28, 2017  4:18PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 28, 2017 4:44PM by Ben_Robbins.">edited January 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            .                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459685">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459685/#Comment_459685" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-28T16:52:14+00:00" title="January 28, 2017  4:52PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The disagreements over this seem to mostly stem from different understanding of "fascism" on the parts of different discussioneers. Some focus on the idea of "fighting fascism" at the roots, the way art generally works to shape ideas and attitudes; others consider the message of the activity, what kind of narratives and lessons make up the superficial content; yet others consider practical politics and the negligible impact that art in general has on immediate real-world events.<br/><br/>An example of how these different levels might play out in practice may help illustrate how different are the aspects of the question:<br/><br/><b>The Name of the Rose</b> fights fascism by illustrating how negative, fearful crisis thinking can lead man astray, and how enlightenment values help guide you to a better path. It does not directly address fascism by name; the content is at most allegorical, and mostly philosophical and thematic. The novel only fights fascism in the sense that a person taking its lessons to heart has a difficult time fitting fascism into their worldview, too.<br/><br/><b>Schindler's List</b> fights fascism by being an anti-nazi propaganda movie: it shows in clear, simple terms what human suffering, cowardice and bravery look like in an actual historical fascist society, and it argues against the values and cultural edifice in question.<br/><br/><b>Thomas Mann</b> fought fascism by creating highly politically antagonistic works of art during an era when a fascist political movement was in control of his country. He was, obviously, censored by a fascist government. Interestingly he worked in rhetoric at the time (instead of writing, for which he is more well-known), by broadcasting speeches to Germany from outside the country. This is where the line between an activity of art and an activity of political agitation begins to blur, when the art is being motivated by immediate practical needs.<br/><br/><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugen_Schauman" rel="nofollow">Eugen Schauman</a> was a Finnish nationalist who murdered the Russian governor-general of Finland during the "Years of Oppression" in 1904. He fought fascism tooth and nail, with extreme, self-destructive zeal, yet opting still for a symbolic gesture instead of concrete long-term action, which sort of makes him count as an example of what "art" might look like if it <i>actually</i> fought fascism in the literal sense of the word. Any more concrete than that, and it's not even performance art or propaganda of the deed anymore.<br/><br/>Of those four, which are actually "fighting fascism"? Are any of them? All of them? They all may be considered works of art or culture at least in some way, and they all are works that a fascist would probably prefer to not have ever been brought to light. Interesting how volatile the concept of "fighting" can be, when applied to the arts.<br/><br/>I think it's likely that we do not mostly disagree about the facts (as in, what a given game does or doesn't do), it's all just quibbling about what "fascism" means or what "fighting" means. If one thinks that only shooting a fascist is "fighting", then the mere idea of a rpg somehow fighting fascism is a category error - game books do not fight, and neither do GMs, at least in the execution of their GMing duties. Similarly, if one thinks that only Benito Mussolini's historical Fascist party was fascist, and nothing else is, then most games probably do not fight fascism in any shape or form - even the ones that might include the historical Fascist party in the game are probably not extremely stridently opposed to a dead and buried Italian popular movement.<br/><br/>As for whether mere game designers are qualified to talk about fascism: I cannot speak for you all, but I am. I am qualified by the fact that I am an adult citizen of the republic of Finland, and consequently vested with the power and responsibility of political participation. I am, quite literally, qualified by the system of government (which might, of course, be a horrible mistake - I'm cool with it if you don't accept my credentials on this). It is, ironically, a fascist idea that democracy does <i>not</i> work, and the common citizen is <i>not</i> qualified to hold political opinions and contribute to societal discourse <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459686">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459686/#Comment_459686" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-28T17:14:03+00:00" title="January 28, 2017  5:14PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 28, 2017 5:34PM by Bedrockbrendan.">edited January 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/><br/>As for whether mere game designers are qualified to talk about fascism: I cannot speak for you all, but I am.

I said being game designers or writers doesn't automatically make us experts on fascism. I think this is much different than exploring themes in a book where you can talk about fascism and you either do it successfully and it resonates or you fail. Here people are suggesting that the structure of the game actually has real world implications regarding fascism and claiming they have insight into how to make people less fascist by structuring games a particular way. That claim, in my view, requires something more than, "I am a citizen of X country". There is an argument being made here that seems to be, games where player spotlight isn't built into the game itself, encourages fascism and leads to undemocratic thinking. This isn't me saying you shouldn't talk politics, or that you are not qualified to express a political opinion. But people are making some seriously bold claims here without any amount of actual support. And the claims being made are pretty much a charge of fascism for any game that doesn't have a democratic resolution system. It isn't just some innocent observation, you are calling other gamers fascist because they have different tastes from you. <br/><br/>I think this thinking also treats your customers and the players at your table in a much different way than a writer trying to address fascist themes in a book. There is something a bit insidious about feeling I have to fix my players, or make sure they are cultivating sufficiently anti-fascist thinking. When I pick up a book that addresses fascism in its themes, I am choosing to engage that material. When players come over for a game, they are looking for an entertaining past time, they are not signing up for a religious experience or psychotherapy. That approach treats gaming more like church or collective self help.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459687">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459687/#Comment_459687" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-28T18:11:19+00:00" title="January 28, 2017  6:11PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 28, 2017 6:11PM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited January 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right. I had to reread the thread to see who'd claimed that. For clarity, it was Ben, in the post Brendan answered a few posts back:\n<blockquote>I've heard that around WWII, Roosevelt and others were naturally deeply concerned with figuring out what conditions allowed fascism to flourish (q.v. Eleanor Roosevelt and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights).<br/><br/>One conclusion was that for fascism to prosper, people had to believe that democracy did not work -- that the system was corrupt or their voice would be ignored.

To me it just looks like an observation on the theme that we've been spitballing from the start: that people are made of their experiences, and one of the reasons we value the arts is their refining influence, and perhaps we can isolate and point out some specific features of our chosen artistic medium that are particularly relevant to fascism. At most one could construe Ben saying that some games probably influence people differently from others. Do you really disagree with that? It seems like a pretty extreme claim that a beloved hobby has no influence on us at all, considering all the hours I've spent on it.<br/><br/>By the way, this has very little to do with "trying to fix players". That reading is completely on you, if you think that the only way a game could have political overtones is because the GM is trying to brainwash their players. In my gaming life it is thoroughly normal for everybody participating in play to bring, well, their own humanity to the table. Trying for some sort of a "pure entertainment" wouldn't even occur to me, and I wouldn't know how to even do that without being utterly boring.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Regarding the idea that one cannot or should not make statements about rpg design and fascism without a degree in political science (I assume that this is what you mean by "qualified to give a public lecture on fascism"), I don't really agree; I don't believe in arguments from authority. If we had a political scientist here who wanted to argue this way or that, I would assume that they would have some better argument than "I'm a political scientist, and therefore you should believe me". And contrariwise, I expect a better argument than "you're not a political scientist, so don't go debating a Serious Issue like this" when addressing the common citizen.<br/><br/>This does mean that I like people to show their work when they make interesting claims. So some people are suggesting that roleplaying as an activity could influence a person's political values (particularly regarding fascism), while others say that no, roleplaying is just entertainment, it doesn't change who you are as a person. Rather than deciding that we are not qualified to think this over, why not try? We might succeed, and thus save another political scientist the trouble of explaining things to us.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459688">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182" title="phoenix182"><img alt="phoenix182" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nHOMEOBBP484M.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182">phoenix182</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459688/#Comment_459688" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-28T18:58:21+00:00" title="January 28, 2017  6:58PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My games are only 'published' to my own tables, but that being said:<br/><br/>Rule 0 and Pay What you Will (above actual physical costs).<br/><br/>I try to include some variant of Rule 0 in nearly everything and fundamentally it's about individuality over collectivism.

However, we have both differing experiences and differing interpretations of what we observe - which I think is what is driving the differences in opinion. <br/><br/>I agree about showing work.

I've read up considerably on studies in the psychological effects of traditional RPGs, and none of them have shown a shift towards authoritarian values.

Based on my experience, I don't think that engaging in democracy in every activity reinforces democratic values - i.e. I don't think that a sports team that votes democratically on their plays would necessarily be an anti-fascist influence on society.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459691/#Comment_459691" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-28T20:30:14+00:00" title="January 28, 2017  8:30PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think I've seen direct evidence for rpgs - or other art forms for that matter - influencing political values. Perhaps a statistical study would show some correlations to something. On a more subtle (circuitous, some might say) level the influence of art is pretty clear, though.<br/><br/>I'll throw an anecdote to illustrate what sort of experience everybody probably has on this matter. This should illustrate the nature of the influence that rpgs and such can have on humans.<br/><br/>My anecdote runs thus: I know this hobbyist who makes his living in a dead-end job, and whose social skills are somewhat curtailed - he's a nice but weird person. He has experienced many of the frustrations that modern society has to offer: unemployment, mental health issues, loneliness, and so on. In his teenage years he was suppressed from school for bringing a weapon there. However, this same person is also a talented roleplayer and historical re-enactor, a swordfighter and craftsman. Over the years roleplaying specifically has given him experiences in advanced cooperative skills, to a degree where he has worked his way to a social and creative leadership position in his hobbyist circles: running his own swordsmanship club, selling craftwork in the scene with his girlfriend, that sort of thing. He has never been apprehended or convicted of a crime.<br/><br/>The person in the anecdote is in no way special, I know many similar people. What they have in common is that art as an aspect of their life has given them a few important things: an outlet for their feelings, a source of wisdom, social connections - with everything that entails - and artistic accomplishment.<br/><br/>Now, this being the world where the person in the anecdote did not become a fascist (or a school shooter for that matter), I am not in position to tell you that roleplaying somehow prevented such an outcome. I can only say that statistically (the following can all be verified from various studies on the matter, with all the caveats that go into reading such studies literally) the supporters of extreme right-wing politics are people who feel threatened, lonely, socially outcast, socially awkward, have a biased cultural life if any at all, lack in life experience and have difficulty with empathy. All of these are also traits that I have personally witnessed the person in my anecdote to have difficulty with, but also to have improved through diligent exercise of roleplaying (and other related cultural activities). I have, quite literally, followed the growth of this person over the years from somebody who I could see becoming a fascist into a well-adjusted member of society.<br/><br/>I think that this sort of argument is probably the closest that one can reasonably get when claiming that "roleplaying prevents fascism". As I implied in my first post to this thread already, I believe that fascism is not strictly a legitimate political philosophy; it is a function of human nature related to authoritarian crisis response, and the cure is, I think, in living an apt life. Cultural interests are definitely a part of such an apt life, and roleplaying particularly has proven, I think, to be an excellent choice for our generation: there is much in its practice that will easily and naturally disincline the practitioner towards fascism.<br/><br/>All that being said, yeah - the very best argument I can muster is at the same level as "joining the boy scouts disinclines children to communism". The arguments are similarly abstract, based on analyzing the phenomenon one wants to protect other people from, and recognizing certain everyday hobbies and lifestyle choices that reduce the appeal of whatever it is that you want to combat. Vague at best, and even a statistical study proving a correlation wouldn't capture the entire picture of why, exactly, communism and scouting rarely occur within the same person.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>An interesting observation on a more general level: historically roleplaying, as part of the wider rubric of wargaming, could have been perceived as a somewhat right-leaning hobby. In the '80s still it was possible to draw certain political lines within the hobby; certain games, often of military bend, had noticeably more conservative themes and a player base that could at times have difficulty relating to the rest of the hobby. Sort of Reagan-like themes, one could say. I'm thinking of e.g. <i>Twilight 2000</i> here, in case it's not clear.<br/><br/>However, later on this let's say mildly rightist or centrist position has to my eyes started to become more and more left-leaning: roleplayers favouring right-wing politics have published less, and they've published more apolitically, it seems to me, while leftist values have become more prominent in publication. It's an interesting trend - assuming that I'm not imagining it, of course. One obviously wonders whether this might be because RPGs attract more liberal than conservative people over time on average, due to the nature of the medium.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459692">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi" title="yukamichi"><img alt="yukamichi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/677/nHW6876KEN77F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi">yukamichi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459692/#Comment_459692" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-28T22:36:16+00:00" title="January 28, 2017 10:36PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On the other hand, Eero, if your acquaintance had started roleplaying with a bunch of neo-nazis instead, do you think he still would have ended up not-a-fascist?

Perhaps the most effective thing any gamer can do to fight fascism is to <b>foster a community around gaming</b> that openly rejects fascism, fascist ideas, and most importantly, fascists themselves. One of the most important tenets of anti-fascism is not allowing fascists a platform, whether you do it through physical force (for example, by kicking them out of your convention or game store or gaming forum), or through softer exertions of power, by making these places so unattractive to them as a place to spread their ideas that they decide they aren't going to be effective.<br/><br/>All that being said (and I apologize if it was actually obvious to everyone but me and I just typed it out for nothing), if you want your game to be a tool against fascism, then you'll want to make it attractive to people who oppose fascism.

There's a reason why I don't play RaHoWa or FATAL, and it isn't the traditional GM/player roles. It's not about getting me interested; it's about not putting me off. The quickest way to put me off is to make it explicit that some people get to be human beings and other people are only allowed to be Something Else (a joke, a target, a prop, etc.). If it's one rule in a otherwise appealing game, it's easy enough to ignore or tweak. It's harder to change the dynamics at the table or gaming culture as a whole, which is where I've come across the most strongly fascist elements in roleplaying.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459694">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459694/#Comment_459694" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-28T23:10:25+00:00" title="January 28, 2017 11:10PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>On the other hand, Eero, if your acquaintance had started roleplaying with a bunch of neo-nazis instead, do you think he still would have ended up not-a-fascist?

We could easily conceive of a neo-nazi gang that, among other group activities, had a roleplaying hobby. I can imagine, just as you can, how such a group would indeed naturally use the rpg medium as a way to reinforce and affirm their convictions.<br/><br/>So perhaps it would be more accurate for my thesis to say that we all hold onto each other as human beings, and therefore, assuming that your gaming group is not <i>already</i> a fascist cell full of propaganda intent, it is unlikely to devolve into one. Putting many people around one table to talk earnestly about how they see the world (a fantasy world in the case of rpgs often enough, but no matter) is likely to maintain a connection to reality (barring a joint intent to detach away into a fascist fantasy land).<br/><br/>(In case that seems like moving goalposts to somebody, note the position statement I made in my first post: it was not strictly speaking that roleplaying is absolutely immune to being made a neo-nazi recruiting tool, but rather simply that I generally see much in my own roleplaying that is incompatible with fascism, and therefore the very practice of play is something of an aid against fascism, even without the game being specifically focused on an anti-fascist crusade.)\n<blockquote>If that's the case, then the propaganda value of any individual game that advertises itself and by extension the hobby as inclusive and protective is arguably more valuable than the mechanics of the game itself, as long as it succeeds at attracting people who support the same values that the game purports to support, and at alienating those who don't support them.</blockquote>\nThis makes sense to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459696">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459696/#Comment_459696" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-29T00:19:44+00:00" title="January 29, 2017 12:19AM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Again Euro I am not saying you can't make Public statements without having expertise in something, but a lot of people are talking as if they do have expertise and we are getting into things like psychology and possibly even neuroscience. Fields where expertise does matter when you are assessing the data. This is an issue I've pointed out before on this forum and I think it isn't a minor point. In so many of these discussions, even when concrete data does get used, it often feels cherry picked to dazzle non-experts into agreeing with questionable assumptions. <br/><br/>I used to work at a medical journal and it took a physician to explain most of the reasons for things in research papers and those of us who were mere editors were not acquainted with the medical science enough to sit there and debate the doctors on the journal articles. I am not an idiot, but I found it very easy in that position for me to go in wildly incorrect directions of thought because I had a kernel of useful information that I thought I understood. The doctor being an expert alone doesn't mean they can assert anything they want, but having the right training and background enabled them to understand the research in a way I couldn't. And if this thread was how does your RPG fight cancer, I'd give more weight to the medical doctors weighing in than the people who just seem to be saying stuff that is a combination of their gut feeling, what they've read on the internet, etc. <br/><br/>But even if we made some kind of connection I still have to question the ethics here. There seems to be something manipulative about the way people are suggesting we use these games. I have less of an issue when it is just the themes being brought into the setting. But people have asserted a connection between the mechanics played and the way people think. If there really is a connection between people using more democratic systems, and more democratic thinking in their daily life, it is almost like you are shaping them without their knowledge or permission if you believe games have that kind of power. Personally I am highly skeptical of the idea that engaging in democracy all the time, for the minutiae of daily life, somehow leads to a more democratic and less fascist mindset (I can't imagine that I'd have good feelings toward democracy if everything under the sun got voted on during the course of my day). <br/><br/>Just because democracy works well for government, that doesn't mean it is well suited to all other interactions. I like the idea of voting for a political leader, not as sold on voting on what's for dinner each night (especially if others are voting on what I get to eat), or voting on what should happen to Rick when his elf takes a fireball in the face. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459697">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459697/#Comment_459697" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-29T00:47:54+00:00" title="January 29, 2017 12:47AM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't you think that our experiences shape us, Brendan? Perhaps we should have started from there with this whole thing, because where you see somebody shaping <i>somebody else</i>, I'm just seeing a discussion about how different life experiences mold us. When your friends invite you to the movies it's not a conspiracy to make you into a well-adjusted individual who can enjoy movies; it's just them being your friends. Furthermore, they may even realize that it is healthy to get Brendan out of the house once in a while, and it's healthy to get him to talk about his movie experience - does them realizing this make them manipulative? Would it be better if they were acting on pure instinct?<br/><br/>I'll be first in line to declare that I find objectifying other people loathsome - I take Immanuel Kant's moral imperative ("treat humanity not as merely means, but also an end") entirely seriously as a life lesson. However, if I also believe that fascism is a deficiency in knowledge and wisdom, and move to fix that deficiency by offering other people <i>more</i> of those things, am I a manipulative brainwasher? I tend to think that I am not, because in a certain sense I am offering tools of personal liberation and determination, rather than merely shaping the person into something I personally find apt.<br/><br/>To take this to its necessary conclusion: I do not, properly speaking, oppose fascism. I merely happen to believe that there is much in fascist thought that is not true, and therefore it falls into the domain of things upon which we can work on in ourselves and others: we can learn, and we can teach, all without being manipulative conspirators. Were I to discover that these measures are not enough, I would not be among those willing to lie to get rid of fascism; honesty in dealings is more important to me than political ideologies.<br/><br/>Perhaps others here meant what you claim, that fascism is a moral evil that justifies manipulating other people in subtle ways to oppose it, making tools of them and their hobbies for an anti-fascist crusade. I find this improbable, though, on the whole. Unless they come in and correct me, I'm just going to be assuming that we're discussing ways to enlighten people, not to mislead them.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Regarding the supposed connection between democracy and rpg mechanics, I am not confident. I think that the connections are deeper and more subtle: it's not just that you put in lots of voting mechanisms into your game, and hey presto, the players learn to appreciate voting and fall into love with the practice, and then they want to go out and vote on all sorts of things. That would be at best a mockery of the actual democratic virtues and philosophy.<br/><br/>Rather, if I had to speculate about particular features of roleplaying games that discourage fascism, I'd place <i>consensual cooperative action</i> at the top. This has nothing to do with voting, but everything to do with the way people act in group activity. I half-remember seeing some study sometime about the connections between far-right thought and hierarchical authority organizations, but no matter; I'll just say that my intuition is that roleplaying games generally, no matter the mechanics, require the players to have a confidential, empathetic, cooperative relationship to even begin to consider playing together. That's much more of a problem for fascism than whether the game uses democratic rules mechanics; a person well-proficient in working together, taking others into account and reaching goals consensually has learned all sorts of things that do not actually have much room in the fascist worldview.<br/><br/>Know what's the opposite of consensual cooperative action?

Would it be better if they were acting on pure instinct?<br/></blockquote>\nI think life experiences have an influence and I also think we choose how to respond to them, but I don't think people are easily predictable in how they will respond. When it comes to political messages, I think this is even more the case (many people responded to the just say no campaign by not doing drugs, others responded by becoming more skeptical of claims by authority because the message was heavy handed and simplistic). Experience isn't a one way street. <br/><br/>But experiences having an impact on us, doesn't mean every experience we have needs to be an exercise in getting someone to think less like a fascist. If you are constantly working on sending the message, I think you eventually end up with a just say no situation, where some people start to wonder what this forbidden fruit is all about. This goes double if you are just a game designer who makes elf games. Why should I listen to what a game designer has to say on such a big issue? <br/><br/>With your friends, sure people trying to get me out of the house because it is healthy and fun, that is one thing. But that isn't the same as indoctrination. If my friends were taking me out of the house with the intent of making me a good Christian, a good scientologist, a good democrat or good republican, because my thoughts were not sufficiently pure for them, there is something manipulative and not genuine about the experience. Especially if the thing we are talking about is this vague definition of fascism. <br/><br/>I am 100% against fascism, but I am not sure, based on what people are saying, that that is what people are fighting about. To me this sounds like fascism as it was used in critiques in the 70s and 80s against violent movies where violence was used as an entertaining resolution. It got ridiculous, to the point that people were calling robocop a fascist film. It seems like people are either worried about the games not feeling sufficiently democratic in their resolution systems, or that the content is somehow a cypher for re-enacting things like colonialism (or at least encouraging colonialist thinking). This is where I get concerned because then we start getting into issues of 'does killing a goblin' make you fascist or make you a racist; or does having combat as a resolution in games encourage real world violence (and what should that violence be directed at). That kind of constant crusading for purity can drain all the energy, creativity and excitement out of a medium. I think it is also based on very questionable assumptions. I don't see it as fighting fascism, I see it as enforcing a vague sense of wholesomeness on entertainment in a misguided way. And ultimately, I see it as a kind of fascism in its own right.<br/><br/>By the way, I am not saying new and interesting systems that focus on things other than combat are a bad idea. I am saying it is questionable to encourage the spread of those kinds of games by saying traditional GM authority, dungeon delves and killing goblins means you might be a secret fascist (or playing a game written by a fascist/colonialist---I know we had one person here at least who levied that claim against Gygax). I don't see this as fighting fascism, I see it as an extreme version of badwrongfun. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459708">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459708/#Comment_459708" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-29T14:09:29+00:00" title="January 29, 2017  2:09PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with your point, Brendan.

And ultimately, I see it as a kind of fascism in its own right.</blockquote>\nYes. The way I see it is sort of the polar opposite of this kind of wholesomeness thinking: I prefer my roleplaying to be <i>more</i> incisive and challenging, not less. Usually I get lambasted (by the Internet, I mean - no problems with the people I play with) for having horribly discomfortable content, rather than for stifling wholesomeness.<br/><br/>To me it seems like we've seen flashes of three sorts of sentiments in this thread. I don't want to attach labels to people, because people aren't ideas, but some seem to lean more towards one of these three philosophies than others:<br/><br/><b>Gaming as politics</b> is the idea that you are what you eat, and therefore roleplaying games should be concordant with your political ideas: if you're a Christian, the game needs to advocate for Good over Evil; if you're a liberal, it needs to feature fascist-bashing. In this view games like D&amp;D can be a problem (particularly for liberals over some other ideological bases) because they celebrate retrograde values in their content, such as colonialism, racism and race war.<br/><br/><b>Gaming as art</b> is the idea that we engage games proactively as a form of communication and philosophy, and therefore games should be honest and incisive in a way that fosters personal growth, or at least doesn't stifle it. The big problems for this view are games that trivialize issues and bamboozle their players into false contentment with superficial truths. For this idea D&amp;D is not as problematic as for the political perspective, but it's still a problem when gaming gets consumerist, commercial and corporate, because the corporations do not want us to grow beyond our assigned roles as consumers, and that shows in conspiciously consumerist games like modern D&amp;D.<br/><br/><b>Gaming as entertainment</b> is the idea that games are a sanctuary from the troubles of the real world, and using them as vehicles for politics or philosophy is intrusive, disruptive and ultimately a breach of a social contract in the interest of exploiting other people who are here just to have a good time. Fascist content in games is much less of an issue for this perspective than it is for the two other ones, because it's just entertainment - if fascism entertains, then that's its proper place. D&amp;D certainly is not problematic, it's the most popular rpg ever and a fine pastime.<br/><br/>Perhaps that labeling helps a little in figuring out what's going on with the different perspectives people bring into this. It is pretty common in rpg discussions in general for people to misunderstand each other due to these sorts of fundamental differences in perspective. It does <i>not</i> help that the perspectives synergize on various ways for various people: for example, it's pretty common for people to simply consider <i>art to be entertaining</i>, which means that e.g. I am myself not somehow opposed to the idea that gaming is entertainment - I just happen to think that for it to be worthwhile entertainment for me, it needs to be art <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459710/#Comment_459710" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-29T14:14:02+00:00" title="January 29, 2017  2:14PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I agree with your point, Brendan.

I merely picked the one example that was most relevant to me, as a radical anti-authoritarian whose imperative is to locate the source of social ills in unjust hierarchies (an idea that I consider to be parallel to ideas that inform "Story Gaming" ethos, for what it's worth), and because I also believe that the marginalized and oppressed people who are more likely to be outspoken critics of fascism (as well as its victims) are also more prone to be sensitive to the problems of hierarchies in ways that those who benefit more from hierarchies are not (and also because "authoritarianism/democracy" seemed to be a contentious line of discussion in this thread, compared to other issues of concern to leftists that were less so). While authoritarianism and fascism are not the same thing, and fascism itself is many-faceted, I have a hard time imagining an effective fascism that is not authoritarian; that is to say, my anti-fascism follows from my anti-authoritarianism, and not vice versa, that there are other perfectly valid reasons to be anti-fascist, and that being anti-fascist does not necessarily require being anti-authoritarian (or at least, not radically).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459714">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459714/#Comment_459714" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-29T14:48:07+00:00" title="January 29, 2017  2:48PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>That I did.

They say they are starting with some vague philosophical or literary meaning, but then it quickly turns into Mussolini. See my point about robocop, but I think casually throwing around the term fascist to describe things like cop movies or heroic adventure, you've watered down the term to the point that it is kind of meaningless (most people would agree Mussolini is bad, few would agree that heroic adventure is bad-----but it is clearly being used because everyone thinks Mussolini when they hear the word). And while one can claim alternative use of the word, it is obviously a charged and powerful word when invoked. You can shift back and forth between 'fascism as philosophy term' and 'fascism as Mussolini'. Either way though, I don't think Gygax was a fascist, and I think labeling him that in this kind of discussion is an obvious attempt to tar people who might like 1E, old school play or even just D&amp;D (I mean who wants to play a game written by a fascist?)<br/><br/>Either way though, it isn't nothing to call someone a fascist. Especially when you are attributing largely secret motives to them. Look, if the guy advocated actual colonialism in the DMG or called for actual authoritarian nationalism in the The Town and City Social Structure section, then you might have a point. But I've read the DMG multiple times and do not get fascist from it at all (or colonialist romanticism). <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459715">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459715/#Comment_459715" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-29T15:18:28+00:00" title="January 29, 2017  3:18PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 29, 2017 3:23PM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited January 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Regarding terminology:<br/><br/>If you feel that the word "fascism" has been soiled out of recognition by it becoming a generic swear-word, then two questions I'd like your - and other people's - feedback on, just so we won't unnecessarily confuse each other:<br/><br/>1) What would be a better term to describe the philosophical doctrines that politicians, philosophers, artists and laymen used to call "fascist" in the 1920s to 1940s?

I thought that when Kyle introduced the "how does you game fight fascism" question at the start, he meant literal fascism (radical right wing, etc. etc.) and not just "baddy stuff I don't like". But maybe I've been confused all along. Is fascism now officially a synonym for "things I don't like" in American political lexicon?<br/><br/>I feel like I should be explicit about my own background here: fascism is not some sort of a distant, abstract boogeyman for me. It is not a synonym for "Sauron". In recent years Finnish right wing radicalism has gone completely coocoo, and in fact my own brother has essentially become a fascist (he's the sort of intellectual who dislikes labels put on himself, but if it barks like a dog...). I hope you'll forgive me if I was confused about what the intent of the term was.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Regarding interpretations of texts:<br/><br/>Do you think that works of art or pieces of prose can, in fact, have a philosophical content? That is, can we say that this piece, because of the themes it introduces, develops and celebrates, <i>is</i> democratic or fascist or romantic or cubist? Is it just a category error to propose such associations between philosophical currents and schools on the one hand, and works of art on the other? I feel like this is a pretty basic point that we would have to agree on for us to characterize e.g. the AD&amp;D core books to be <i>anything</i> in ideological terms.<br/><br/>The reason for why I think that Gygax probably was a little bit fascist in his thinking is not that I have witnessed some explicit political declaration from him. It's the exact same sort of literary criticism that comes to conclude that e.g. Narnia stories have a Christian content.<br/><br/>Consider the following cornerstone themes of the D&amp;D fantasy world:<br/><b>*</b> World history is a history of racial nation states, the relations of which are largely determined in terms of dominance and genocide. Where races live in peace, it occurs on the terms of transcendent spiritual forces as exemplified by Alignment.<br/><b>*</b> Prominent Great Men arise at times to carve their own fiefs out of places where central authorities are weak. Leadership passes to those with the archetypal signs of greatness, as exemplified by Class and Level.<br/><b>*</b> Evil surrounds and permeates the world, and it is the task of the brave, exceptional members of civilization to travel within the heart of darness and snuff it out by violent confrontation.<br/><b>*</b> All of the above is explicitly a good thing, and the Way Things Are - in by the book vanilla D&amp;D neither player characters nor NPCs are in any way empowered to seek alternatives. People who are Neutral are <i>wrong</i> in a very spiritual, fundamental way, and the only way to become right is to get with the program.<br/><br/>What is that if it's not fascist? Are those not central tenets of what makes D&amp;D unique as a work of literature? What is D&amp;D if not fascist, in ideological terms? I suggested romanticized colonialist paternalism (the sort of thought that reigned in the non-fascist conservative societies a hundred years back) as an alternative, but is that no good, either?<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Regarding my intentions in calling Gygax fascist:<br/><br/>I did not intend the word as a slur. I have in fact been enthusiastically playing the game for years now. When I suggested that Gygax's work has fascist tones it was intended as an analysis to be considered, not a political maneuver to accuse D&amp;D players of fascism.<br/><br/>If you're wondering how I can claim to simultaneously dislike fascism, consider D&amp;D to have a lot of fascism in it, and to like D&amp;D, I suggest re-reading what I wrote in the first leg of the thread about the way my D&amp;D campaign interacts with fascism - it's all explained in there.

I think that leads to the equivocation. I don't think the term has been soiled out of recognition. I think you do drain it of its power though if you use Fascism to describe Robocop or D&amp;D. Then when an actual Mussolini rolls into town, and you call him fascist, no one believes you because you also thought Murphy and Gygax were fascist.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459717/#Comment_459717" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-29T15:34:46+00:00" title="January 29, 2017  3:34PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/><br/>If you're wondering how I can claim to simultaneously dislike fascism, consider D&amp;D to have a lot of fascism in it, and to like D&amp;D, I suggest re-reading what I wrote in the first leg of the thread about the way my D&amp;D campaign interacts with fascism - it's all explained in there.

Ideas are quick little buggers, one would think that it'd be easy and effortless to examine them and determine whether somebody is espousing fascism or not. I would think that it's completely irrelevant who <b>I</b> call fascist and whether I am believed, for you can surely decide for yourself.<br/><br/>Are you just assuming that there needs to be a high burden of proof because you have some sort of an immediate societal action you're going to take when a "real" fascist comes to town, and you don't want to waste the crisis response on any wannabes? I could see how one would have to require a very high degree of proof of fascism if any fascists were supposed to be captured and stoned to death, or something like that. In that kind of situation I certainly wouldn't go around calling <i>anybody</i> fascist!<br/><br/>Also, what kind of "power" does the term "fascism" have, could we hear more about that? Is it important for the term not to be over-used so that it can still work effectively as a call to arms when liberty is threatened? So it would perhaps be better if we did indeed have some sort of a round-about synonym to be used for the "little fascists", in those situations where we just want to talk philosophy instead of doing whatever it is that we do when a Mussolini rolls into town? This way "fascism" could remain a distant, mythological thing, sort of like a secular "Satan", and when it is finally invoked, we'll all know that Shit Just Got Serious, right?<br/><br/>In case it's not obvious, I find this entire concept of terminological hygiene a bit suspect. It's not like it actually works in the real life, right? Even if we consider "fascism" to be the highest accolade of evil, only to be used when you've literally seen somebody hail Hitler with your own eyes, there'll still be a necessity to actually examine people's words and deeds. What if whoever told you about the hail Hitler thing was lying, for example?<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Regarding heroism, I don't think that is fascist per se as an idea. However, discovering the highest ideal of individual purpose in service to the state is very much a cornerstone of the fascist ideological edifice. This kind of heroism is not unique to fascism, but when combined with other ideas (imminent crisis, need for authoritative action, romantic mythology of the state and nation) it is indeed fascist. For example, I don't think that I do any grave injustice to anybody if I say that the kind of heroism depicted in the movie <i>The Birth of a Nation</i> is philosophically fascist.<br/><br/>Furthermore, fascism is a romantic ideology, it <i>needs</i> the very densest sort of heroic mythology to make any sense at all to people. Read any serious fascist creeds, and they just ooze heroic imagery. Again, heroic narratives for other reasons are possible, but you have to admit that fascism has a special relationship to it; it is the only ideology that combines a revolutionary call to arms with conservative defense of the homeland. (Some philosophers like to define fascism by this, in fact: it is "revolutionary conservatism".)<br/><br/>Do note that heroism in D&amp;D is, if not precisely like this, then at least pretty close: D&amp;D adventurers are "heroic" insofar as they are both Great and Good, where the latter is determined by their allegiance to the Lawful collective. It's not precisely a nation state that the D&amp;D adventurers are heroes <i>of</i>, but that's literary theming for you - the way that the D&amp;D hero exemplifies the virtues of their Alignment, subsuming the individual for the cause, is something I think old Benito would have approved of. After all, he already knows what is Good and Lawful, and so do his followers; the next step is to be convinced that every little boy's and girl's greatest dream should be to give their very lives for the greater good.<br/><br/>In case anybody is reminded of religious extremism by all this talk about sacrificing yourself for the greater good, well, fascism is sort of similar to more extreme religious ideologies, isn't it? Or, to phrase that in an alternate way, some religious institutions are pretty fascist.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459719/#Comment_459719" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-29T16:28:29+00:00" title="January 29, 2017  4:28PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 29, 2017 4:43PM by Bedrockbrendan.">edited January 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/><br/><br/>Consider the following cornerstone themes of the D&amp;D fantasy world:<br/><b>*</b> World history is a history of racial nation states, the relations of which are largely determined in terms of dominance and genocide.

I will say this, I think your interoperation of D&amp;D is incorrect, or at the very least uncharitable and distorted. <br/><br/>1) Content does not equal message. You can have content that relates to a thing, but that doesn't mean the message, purpose or intent is to promote that thing (and it doesn't make it inherently an issue). <br/><br/>2) Most of this, even with early D&amp;D, depends on the specific campaign. There is a big difference between settings. <br/><br/>3) There is a lot of equivocation on the word Race in D&amp;D, but when you are talking elves, dwarves and halflings, I think it is a bit of a stretch to equate those with real world races, since they are more in the realm of intelligent mythical creatures. But much of D&amp;D is just kingdoms and city states governed by different humans. Race isn't really a big part of this, and when it is, it is usually an accident of the history they are borrowing from (i.e. you might have Mongolian-like Mongols in your campaign world). I don't know what version of D&amp;D you played, but the one I played wasn't about genocide. I assume you are thinking about things like kobolds and goblins. To equate killing monsters with racial genocide, to me seems a stretch. Not saying it isn't more interesting to have a setting that treats evil as a choice, rather than having beings who are inherently more evil or a product of evil. But D&amp;D draws on myth and legend where evil monsters are assumed to be a thing. That doesn't mean those monsters represent real world racial groups. <br/><br/>4) One striking problem of a lot of early D&amp;D settings is kings and other leaders often have very low level (which in a live campaign, makes them easy to overthrow). So I call BS on this point. True, characters increase in power level over time, and that affects how they can shape the world, but that isn't fascism, that is just the reality that in a world where people have fireball spells, the guy with the fireball spell can probably become king a little easier than the guy with a stick. <br/><br/>You mention Great Men theory. I really don't want to get bogged down in a debate about historiography but while that is a lot of things, I don't think the great man model is inherently fascist. You can use it to create an anti-fascist narrative. The issue historians have with great man theory isn't that is is inherently fascist, but that it doesn't seem like the best explanation for the flow of history (there are other things that matter in explaining the course of historical events). <br/><br/>But D&amp;D is the furthest thing from Great Man Theory. If anything D&amp;D is micro history. Anyone who has spent five minutes GMing for a session of D&amp;D knows a good portion of it is devoted to the minutia of the daily lives of regular people. This is why people geek out over occupations in villages, trade goods, and things like social class. Just because powerful lords and knights might exist in the medieval setting, that doesn't make it Great Man Theory. The book Bewitching of Anne Gunther is the polar opposite of Great Man Theory, but powerful rulers still exist in it. It is just the focus is on the ground level details of everyday people. Arguably that is what PCs are. It is all about the grunts on  the ground doing the dungeon delving and managing resources. <br/><br/>D&amp;D is about regular people, regardless of social class, who go off on adventures and become heroes. That isn't great man theory. That is myth. At times it is micro history. <br/><br/>5) The problem with your point about evil is it ignores the fact that players don't have to be good. Alignment arguments get tricky and depend a lot on edition, but assuming we're talking AD&amp;D, players can be Lawful Good, but they can also be Chaotic Evil. They can be the bad guys. They can be the good ideas. They are not ever under an obligation to eradicate evil (in fact, I've been in many, many campaigns where the players didn't just go around executing every creature they detected as Evil). There has also been a long evolution around alignment over time. The one thing it isn't though, is reflective of real world morality. It is a thought experiment, where you have a cosmology where there are chaotic forces, good forces, evil forces, neutral forces. And it never really makes anyone of these prime. I think we can have all kinds of debates about alignment, how well it works, whether it makes sense, but I don't think it is inherently fascist.   <br/><br/>6) D&amp;D doesn't seem to be making any moral claims about power, levels, class, etc. There is no argument that tough guys with lots of fighting ability are best or that wizards with spells ought to rule because they can blast everyone to bits. They are just the most interesting to play. Kings exist in the game, I don't think the game promotes monarchy. <br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459720">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459720/#Comment_459720" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-29T16:38:05+00:00" title="January 29, 2017  4:38PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a fair defense and a reasonable interpretation of D&amp;D, I think.

As such it gets tossed around when it really shouldn't be, and very few who use it even know exactly what it is.<br/><br/>Specifically 'fascism' refers to a nationalistic authoritarian regime which couples government with economic production. It requires all of those elements to truly qualify. For instance, if you remove the economic entanglement it's merely authoritarian nationalism, not fascism. There are other elements that are almost always present (acceptance of violence, anti-egalitarianism, etc), but the core is just the above three elements.<br/><br/>Fascism is created by monied interests working together to take over government in order to reinforce their own profits through strict and abusive government controls, using nationalistic rhetoric to achieve populist support (rather or not they actually agree with that rhetoric is debatable). Indeed, the origin of the Italian fascist rise was a consortium of guilds and corporations (heavily leftist btw) bankrolling those espousing Mazzini's politics (with the caveat that they would always retain favor and influence above and beyond broader national interests).<br/><br/><b>2.</b> So this one is my pet peeve (and actually the subject of my poli-sci dissertation). There is NO such thing as a valid single-axis political spectrum. Period. The entire left/right dichotomy is crap, and wholly incapable of accurately describing either movements or populations. Frankly, I believe it to be a BIG part of the reason our politics/government are in the crapper.<br/><br/>Fascism is a perfect example of why this is true, since it can be accurately demonstrated in left, right, and centrist models. As noted above the rise of Italian fascism was almost entirely Leftist, but popularized through Rightist rhetoric to reach the people. <br/><br/>In fact, you can't even really describe/locate fascism using popular two-axis spectrum analysis (such as political compass). It still ends up occupying different, opposed points on the plot. <br/><br/>In order to accurately define fascism (and my own argument is 'any modern government or underlying political ideology') requires at least a three-axis model.<br/><br/>Point being, any time we try to claim 'right fascism' or 'left fascism' we do a disservice to the educational merit of the discussion and prevent any accurate outcomes.<br/><br/><b>3.</b> As it relates to the OP, in order to 'fight fascism' you have to contradict one of the three primary tent poles: nationalism, authoritarianism, or economic exploitation by government for private interests.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459726">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459726/#Comment_459726" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-29T20:33:17+00:00" title="January 29, 2017  8:33PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 29, 2017 8:41PM by David_Berg.">edited January 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here are some potential responses to "How does your game fight fascism?" that could make sense to me:\n<blockquote>\u2022 The setting or situations of my game educate people about what fascism looks like and how it works.

Zombies can  be used as metaphors or stand-ins for the poor, for consumers, for immigrants, etc (Romero used them for all three at various points).

In case I am not the only one who feels that way, I will offer a few alternate discussion topics.<br/><br/>First, Eero writes that thoughtful roleplaying/art creation and analysis, at some level, is bound to lead to greater understanding and (possibly) a philosophical disagreement with fascist ideals. He writes that in his own play, this is how it plays out:\n<blockquote><br/>My experience of how the arguably fascist content of play in a mockumentary-like D&amp;D campaign like this plays out is that in the long term it increases the political awareness of the players, and makes them somewhat more empathetic towards the weak of society. [...] Players are often in the boots of the very people enacting cruel, discriminatory thinking ("The only good orc is a dead orc" and so on), which is often cause for ironic commentary from the players; in general the players will usually understand <i>why</i> their characters think the way they do, while also realizing how deeply entangled they are in the socio-cultural web that predetermines much about their beliefs, attitudes and the very social toolbox they have access to in figuring out how to resolve their problems. </blockquote>\nNotable here are the "ironic commentary from the players", their understanding of their characters' philosophy, and realizations about the "socio-cultural web that predetermines much about their beliefs..."<br/><br/>Eero, what makes you so confident that the outcomes you are seeing in your game are somewhat generalizable to other people roleplaying together? What leads you to say that your players are not, instead, taking this rather ideologically limited material and then bringing to it *their own* intelligence, analysis, and modern ideas? Why wouldn't a hypothetical uneducated fascist (perhaps a time traveler from a past epoch) playing such a game come to very different conclusions? Could they find themselves celebrating the ideals at the surface of your game, instead? If not, why not?<br/><br/>Second, I have a question about how game content and design affects the players: <br/><br/>It is a somewhat popular opinion, it seems, that games do not influence our political or philosophical stance (especially from people who consider gaming to be purely an escapist pastime, as opposed to an "art form" which could hold up to scrutiny and analysis).<br/><br/>Particularly if you feel that games do NOT influence our politics, what are your experiences with games like <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> (religious custom, violent means in the hands of its enforcers), <i>Kagematsu</i> (gender roles/relations), <i>Dog Eat Dog</i> (colonial oppression), or <i>Steal Away Jordan</i> (perspectives on slavery)?<br/><br/>What percentage of players do you think might play one of these games and come away without some kind of empathy, understanding, or philosophical questions about the issues presented therein? Clearly it's *possible*. But, if you had to take a guess, what percentage of players might come away from playing such a game without some insights or questioned opinions? Of those players, what percentage might come away with anti-authoritarian ideas? Do you think it's a negligible fraction, or a sizeable one?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459739">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459739/#Comment_459739" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-30T01:39:08+00:00" title="January 30, 2017  1:39AM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Eero, what makes you so confident that the outcomes you are seeing in your game are somewhat generalizable to other people roleplaying together?

(Sorry about that, this is an unusually complex and convoluted topic to lay out casually.) Namely, existentialism.<br/><br/>The <i>real</i> point of the process I tried to describe is not that it is somehow preordained to reduce fascism. Rather, the point is that it is <i>the best effort at wisdom</i> that the players at the table are capable of. Of course the same game being played by other people might come to different conclusions, and therefore, possibly a fascist (or just neutral) ideological outcome. What I meant to say was simply that I am confident that a) gaming as a noble art form increases insight, and b) fascism is something that on the average shies away from enlightenment. Take those two premises, and gaming experiences such as ours will follow: people taking hard subject matters and understanding them better via gaming.<br/><br/>As has since then been rightfully observed in this thread, it is conceivable that a sufficiently fascism-ridden gaming group could engage in honest play, and still end up reaffirming their fascist ideals; I do not deny the allure and insights proffered by this, one of the great ideologies of the last century, and I certainly don't deny human capacity for self-delusion. Still, I think that there is in fact not much more to be done for the human soul than to give him a chance to figure things out. If the best efforts of certain people in a given time or place end up merely affirming fascism, then perhaps there is some truth to it in their lives - they did investigate it honestly, after all. I think that demanding anything more than that goes beyond the purview of art, and by extension, roleplaying.<br/><br/>Still, the original question of the thread was not how our gaming could be so powerful as to convince the most dyed-to-the-wool fascist to change their ways; the question was merely about how our gaming fights fascism. That's one of the answers, I think: curious players engaging in play that illuminates the way society and human nature work are better able to weight political philosophy, and thus less likely to be convinced by the frailer ideology - namely, fascism. This means, to me, that there's quite a lot of play that "fights fascism": every time you play a roleplaying game that illustrates society and human nature, that play fights fascism among the participants. Or, if it empowers fascism, then perhaps it deserves to be empowered.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459744">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459744/#Comment_459744" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-30T02:58:25+00:00" title="January 30, 2017  2:58AM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of the things that I love about 3:16 Carnage Amongst the Stars is that you start out as genocidal bastards and the story evolves from there as the players rediscover themselves and re-evaluate what it means to fight for Terra.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459746">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459746/#Comment_459746" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-30T05:13:35+00:00" title="January 30, 2017  5:13AM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>gaming as a noble art form increases insight</blockquote>I'm fuzzy on when this is and isn't true.

And the problem with vaguely defined moral criteria like this is how easily it can be redefined to suit whatever agenda you want. And I was wrong. Anti-Fascist play does not depend on the choices the players make, but the conclusions they come away with, which means the kind of play which fights <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23Fascism&amp;Mode=like">#Fascism</a> is indistinguishable from that which promotes it.<br/><br/>In the meantime this objective has already caused rifts and misunderstandings between people who would otherwise be fighting <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23Fascism&amp;Mode=like">#Fascism</a> together. This isn't progress, unless the goal is to create an <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23OutGroup&amp;Mode=like">#OutGroup</a>, in which case mission accomplished. And keep in mind this is still a hobby where 'storygamer' is considered a political affiliation and people get defensive when a game tells them how to play it. So what do you think labeling certain kinds of play pro/anti-fascist will do? Because that's exactly what's been done here.\n<blockquote>As a quick aside, this article touches on the topic of how D&amp;D pre-labels many of its non-human races as "evil", making it a prior assumption that killing them is just what you do. Ties in quite nicely to what people have been saying. <a href="https://medium.com/@qh_murphy/new-rules-of-fantasy-1-evil-is-a-choice-40ea7aca6821#.7erlad82w" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://medium.com/@qh_murphy/new-rules-of-fantasy-1-evil-is-a-choice-40ea7aca6821#.7erlad82w</a></blockquote>\nSo do such games promote <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23Fascism&amp;Mode=like">#Fascism</a>? Do such simplified ideologies promote <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23Fascism&amp;Mode=like">#Fascism</a>?\n<blockquote>In my life experience fascism has been particularly credible to people who do not appreciate the virtue of withholding judgement; who rely on simple black-and-white moral narratives; who put great faith into decisive action in times of crisis. My game would delve into the kinds of situations where this kind of thinking is most relevant.</blockquote>\nSo how many of these traits apply to the people fighting <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23Fascism&amp;Mode=like">#Fascism</a> through gaming?\n<blockquote><img alt="image" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3441990/night_witches_interior_art_02.jpg"/></blockquote>\nAnd here's a perfect example of communication which can only be understood by sufficiently qualified members of the in-group <i>who already share the same ideas</i>, which is exactly the problem. So perhaps you can pick up that mic and explain to us how your game fights <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23Fascism&amp;Mode=like">#Fascism</a>...\n<blockquote>The themes of WWII games - including Night Witches - often include nationalism, military heroism, glorification of violence, and dehumanization of the Other. In short, it's heroic to kill Nazis because they're evil. It seems easy to turn heroically killing Nazis for your country into a game that encourages fascism.</blockquote>\n...and avoids becoming this.\n<blockquote>One conclusion was that for fascism to prosper, people had to believe that democracy did not work -- that the system was corrupt or their voice would be ignored. Believing that democracy worked immunized people against fascism, which meant a top priority of would-be fascists would be to attack the validity of the voting system.</blockquote>\nOne <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23Ideology&amp;Mode=like">#Ideology</a> can immunize you from another.\n<blockquote>Few of us are even qualified to give a public lecture on fascism let alone design games that somehow fight fascism.</blockquote>\nThen who is qualified to make a game which fights <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23Fascism&amp;Mode=like">#Fascism</a>?\n<blockquote>It is, ironically, a fascist idea that democracy does <i>not</i> work, and the common citizen is <i>not</i> qualified to hold political opinions and contribute to societal discourse <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/></blockquote>\nTricky, isn't it? Because that would mean the people who oppose #Trump's election are by definition at least <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23ProtoFascists&amp;Mode=like">#ProtoFascists</a>, and will most likely have to change their definition of <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23Democracy&amp;Mode=like">#Democracy</a> to avoid dissonance.\n<blockquote>The disagreements over this seem to mostly stem from different understanding of "fascism" on the parts of different discussioneers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>I think it's likely that we do not mostly disagree about the facts (as in, what a given game does or doesn't do), it's all just quibbling about what "fascism" means or what "fighting" means.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>It is pretty common in rpg discussions in general for people to misunderstand each other due to these sorts of fundamental differences in perspective.</blockquote>\n<a href="/forums/search?Search=%23QED&amp;Mode=like">#QED</a>\n<blockquote>If you're talking about me, I never said or implied anything of the sort.</blockquote>\nHow would you know what you <i>implied</i>?\n<blockquote>The question was "how do games fight fascism" (if they do at all). Inverting that to infer that other games must therefore cause fascism does not make any sense.</blockquote>\nBut if we accept that a game can fight <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23Fascism&amp;Mode=like">#Fascism</a>, then we must also accept that a game can <i>promote</i> it, <i>even if inadvertently</i>, which means finding those games and eliminating them becomes just as important to fighting <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23Fascism&amp;Mode=like">#Fascism</a>.\n<blockquote>Their recruiting relies on preying on the alienated, and I would not be at all surprised if there were groups who did this through seemingly innocuous activities like roleplaying games.</blockquote>\nCareful there. You're starting to sound like those <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23Christian&amp;Mode=like">#Christian</a> radicals who condemned D&amp;D for <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23Satanic&amp;Mode=like">#Satanic</a> recruiting and promoting <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23Homosexuality&amp;Mode=like">#Homosexuality</a>.\n<blockquote>I am uncertain as to whether anybody here intended to argue for political correctness or political manipulation,</blockquote>\nJust asking "How does your game fight fascism" argues for political correctness and manipulation.\n<blockquote>manipulating people is bad because it drains true artistic value out of the exercise of roleplaying,</blockquote>\nThat's complicated, as a GM should be doing some degree of that as part of their job.\n<blockquote>I don't see it as fighting fascism, I see it as enforcing a vague sense of wholesomeness on entertainment in a misguided way. And ultimately, I see it as a kind of fascism in its own right.</blockquote>\nThat's because it is.\n<blockquote>What would be a better term to describe the philosophical doctrines that politicians, philosophers, artists and laymen used to call "fascist" in the 1920s to 1940s?</blockquote>\nI don't know.

And you should be deeply suspicious of anyone deliberately recontextualizing a work for political reasons.\n<blockquote>When I suggested that Gygax's work has fascist tones it was intended as an analysis to be considered, not a political maneuver to accuse D&amp;D players of fascism.</blockquote>\nIt's hard to provide intellectual analysis without someone ascribing political motives to it. Hell, we can't even avoid that when it comes to analyzing game systems and player agendas.\n<blockquote>fascism is a romantic ideology, it <i>needs</i> the very densest sort of heroic mythology to make any sense at all to people.

Are nationalism and authoritarianism never a benefit to society, or do they have their place?\n<blockquote>I think there's a difference between a sort of *philosophical* proto-fascism that embraces nostalgia and the romanticized past, personal heroism, etc., and actual, active *political* fascism of the kind that has recently taken over my country and that of most people who post on this forum.</blockquote>\nSo which one are we fighting, and how do we tell the difference?\n<blockquote>Zombies can be used as metaphors or stand-ins for the poor, for consumers, for immigrants, etc (Romero used them for all three at various points). That doesn't mean every PC who kills a zombie is acting out a secret desire to oppress any one of these groups, or games that feature zombies are encouraging negative thinking toward them.</blockquote>\nDoesn't it? Who's to say?\n<blockquote>what makes you so confident that the outcomes you are seeing in your game are somewhat generalizable to other people roleplaying together? What leads you to say that your players are not, instead, taking this rather ideologically limited material and then bringing to it *their own* intelligence, analysis, and modern ideas?

Understanding how specific forces of oppression work is a completely different story however.\n<blockquote>Putting yourself in another person's shoes has been shown, in various studies, to be one of the best ways to calibrate your moral compass, develop empathy, practical techniques to help others, and even decide how to look at yourself and feel about your own self.<br/><br/>Isn't this a large part of what RPGs do?</blockquote>\nYes.

However, if a group of friends make a garage band and only play for each other - I think they are not having a significant effect on fascism, even if the content of all of their songs is about anti-fascist philosophy and values. Moreover, by thinking that they are fighting fascism by playing their songs to themselves, the band could be failing to take other political activity. <br/><br/>3) A reason why I think the garage band is ineffective is that they aren't reaching a larger audience. Political change demands a fair amount of organizing and outreach. <br/><br/>4) I think RPGs make an excellent tool for reflecting on personalities, history, teamwork, and other topics. I don't think they're a good form for transmitting any particular political value, good or bad. I think that passive media like television has more of a deterministic influence on audiences, while active play like RPGs is dominated more by the social influence of people at the table than anything in the content or rules of the game. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459813">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459813/#Comment_459813" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-02T13:19:19+00:00" title="February  2, 2017  1:19PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Geez, Jason Morningstar, you posted an illustration from <i>Night Witches</i>, but never mentioned <i>Villa Air-Belle</i>?<br/><br/>That game is way more fascist-fighty than NW!<br/><br/>( That's your cue to show folks what you were making, J )                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459814/#Comment_459814" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-02T14:35:58+00:00" title="February  2, 2017  2:35PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So much Fisking                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459815">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459815/#Comment_459815" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-02T14:40:08+00:00" title="February  2, 2017  2:40PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Does that word mean " To act like Kingpin"?

At the same time, I think the social influence of the people at the table can be galvanized for certain purposes by games that appeal to them.  Like, someone who thinks that it's important to view slaves as people rather than just victims or heroes or statistics or whatever, might not have sat down at a table with other people to share that vision in a memorable way until they saw/acquired Steal Away Jordan.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459897">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/adamwb" title="adamwb"><img alt="adamwb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/adamwb">adamwb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459897/#Comment_459897" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-04T19:31:03+00:00" title="February  4, 2017  7:31PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think about this every week.<br/><br/>---\n<blockquote>So <a href="http://www.orwell.ru/library/articles/As_I_Please/english/efasc" rel="nofollow">we still haven't determined what <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23Fascism&amp;Mode=like">#Fascism</a> is</a>, and we still haven't determined what leads to it, so we still can't determine if a game fights or promotes it.</blockquote>\nThat question is not the subject of this thread, although given that your post on the previous page seems to define fascism as evil or cruelty rather than an ideological system of social organization and government I guess it follows.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Anyway:<br/><br/>I first wanted to play old-school D&amp;D because I was fascinated by the influence of its romantic mythology on broader culture. My group and I were reading Thomas Mann together. I made my next group watch <em>The Name of The Rose</em>.<br/><br/>I was fascinated by Gary Gygax's yuppie transformation from DIY publisher to self-imagined corporate heavy-hitter. If you look at Eero's description of him and wonder if those things he wrote in a fictional context reflected his real-world ideology, maybe think about this:\n<blockquote><a href="https://medium.com/@increment/the-ambush-at-sheridan-springs-3a29d07f6836#.q2l427rb5" rel="nofollow">Gygax even compared the rise of TSR through 1980 to a Dungeons &amp; Dragons campaign, with it starting out as \u201ca low-level-character sort of company\u201d but gaining \u201cexcellent experience\u201d to advance towards the \u201creally high-level game producers such as Milton Bradley and Parker Brothers.\u201d</a></blockquote>\nFascism uses the idea of the rule of law a shield for capriciousness, uses racism to cultivate a fear and blame of external forces. It drains decision-making power from the organs of consensus and of careful judgement and concentrates them in an executive that prizes personal loyalty and punishes or purges those who question it.<br/><br/>Before I started to play again, <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/10/04/the-dungeon-master" rel="nofollow">I read this terrifying short story</a> about adolescent boys enacting this dynamic. Maybe it was a caricature, but the rule-zero-based play culture that The Forge reacted against checks a lot of those boxes. Gamergate certainly expressed them more fully and clearly\u2014and from that to the present moment, the one that makes this question seem so urgent, there is a line.<br/><br/>In 2014 I had a terrifying realization that lots of people who I had seen as allies in attempts to dig into the tradition, to <em>work through</em> the parts of gaming that were most terrifying and awful, to play with rules-systems to highlight the monstrous parts of our mythologies\u2014both those called Mythology and the systems that leveraged the heroic to justify themselves in more real ways\u2014were not interested in that at all. A few blow-ups made it pretty clear that a lot of people whose work I had read in this light were actually doing it to build up an edifice of Rightness and of anti-intellectualism or anti-innovation. Some of this happened on this forum.<br/><br/>I thought about stopping then. But again: this was why I played in the first place.<br/><br/>So:<br/><br/>- I create a space that explicitly includes those who might be othered by white power or the patriarchy<br/>- I de-naturalize my own role as leader and rules-author by calling attention to the arbitrariness of our play structure<br/>- I do not try to hide the ugliness of our mythologies but call them out or make fun of them even as I introduce them into the play-space<br/>- I encourage all participants to look upon their \u201cheroic\u201d characters as failures of virtue or tragic or ironic figures<br/>- I mine alternate medievalisms or other antifa fictions for tropes to foil the expected mythology of historicity<br/>- above all, I recognize my game as a community space where we try to look after one another and treat each other with respect, where we share and I try to address my own mistakes there                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459898">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459898/#Comment_459898" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-04T19:45:05+00:00" title="February  4, 2017  7:45PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>- I create a space that explicitly includes those who might be othered by white power or the patriarchy<br/>- I de-naturalize my own role as leader and rules-author by calling attention to the arbitrariness of our play structure<br/>- I do not try to hide the ugliness of our mythologies but call them out or make fun of them even as I introduce them into the play-space<br/>- I encourage all participants to look upon their \u201cheroic\u201d characters as failures of virtue or tragic or ironic figures<br/>- I mine alternate medievalisms or other antifa fictions for tropes to foil the expected mythology of historicity<br/>- above all, I recognize my game as a community space where we try to look after one another and treat each other with respect, where we share and I try to address my own mistakes there</blockquote>\nHuh, that sounds a lot like my D&amp;D campaign.

For example, it is distinctly different from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism" rel="nofollow"><b>Wikipedia entry</b></a> on fascism. In common usage, the word basically means being similar to German Nazism or Italian Fascism (and possibly Spanish Francoism). <br/><br/>One thing I dislike about Eco's essay is that he suggests that ur-fascism is wider than these three examples - but he doesn't identify other examples in history. With no other definitive examples, accusations of ur-fascism still mean by compared to Mussolini and Hitler - which is the same as common usage despite his complex 14-point definition. <br/><br/>In terms of this thread, I think people should just be clear which definition they're using.

And for your efforts, you get a President that celebrated Holocaust Memorial Day by banning refugees on religious grounds and releasing a statement that somehow failed to mention Jews, succesfully confirmed a new AG so racist he couldn't get appointed by the Reagan administration, and who is literally trying to seek cassus belli with <i>Poland</i>.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20941/how-does-your-game-fight-fascism" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20941/how-does-your-game-fight-fascism" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20941/how-does-your-game-fight-fascism/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20941/how-does-your-game-fight-fascism/p3" rel="next">3</a><a class="Next" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20941/how-does-your-game-fight-fascism/p3" rel="next">\xbb</a></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed">This discussion has been closed.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>How does your game fight fascism? - Page 3 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20941/how-does-your-game-fight-fascism/p3" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="How does your game fight fascism? - Page 3" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20941/how-does-your-game-fight-fascism/p3" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Maybe?!?

If he was he wasn't very good at it! But two things are true, I think: that his writing includes a lot of romance and ideas about things that are involved in fascism, as Eero was drawing attention to, and that there is a strong relationship between his writing and his actual beliefs.

We've successfully normalized fascism. And for your efforts, you get a President that celebrated Holocaust Memorial Day by banning refugees on religious grounds and releasing a statement that somehow failed to mention Jews, succesfully confirmed a new AG so racist he couldn't get appointed by the Reagan administration, and who is literally trying to seek cassus belli with <i>Poland</i>. </blockquote>\nYou pick 1964 and Goldwater as the benchmark - but (1) I don't agree that those times were at all lesser in blatant racism compared to now, or (2) that civil right advocates are responsible for the backlash since then. Yes, Goldwater was defeated - but there were a lot of reasons for that other than anti-racism. In many ways, I think the 1970s lapse in racism was a temporary effect of the changeover between Democrats and Republicans. Democrats were growing less racist while Republicans were growing more racist. <br/><br/>For civil rights advocates, it is a familiar refrain that if only we took away the civil rights of the "bad guys" - then the good guys will win. By this logic, if we let bad guys have their civil rights, we're hamstringing the fight against them, and being soft on them. Only by taking the gloves off can we beat the enemy. Of course, there are varying scripts about who the bad guys are - drug dealers, Islamists, communists, Nazis, etc. <br/><br/>First of all, I don't think that denying people their civil rights is effective in the long run for suppressing their views. <br/><br/>Second, even if it were, I don't think the end justifies the means.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460242">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460242/#Comment_460242" name="Item_106" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-14T23:46:17+00:00" title="February 14, 2017 11:46PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe I missed something, but when I see people advocate not normalizing fascists or not giving them platforms, this generally takes the form of, to use an oft-cited expression, <a href="https://xkcd.com/1357" rel="nofollow">"showing them the door"</a>.<br/><br/>For example, by banning them from spaces like forums, clubs; protesting their speaking gigs. etc.<br/><br/>None of which violate any of their civil rights to be horrible human beings elsewhere.<br/><br/>So it feels like the "civil rights/free speech" thing is kinda strawman-y. <br/><br/>(But then I'm not from the US, so the special cultural ... veneration of "Free Speech, no matter how abhorent" that seems to be a thing there doesn't really make all that much sense to me.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460252">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460252/#Comment_460252" name="Item_107" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-15T06:28:20+00:00" title="February 15, 2017  6:28AM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As I understand it, the "civil rights angle" in these discussions is usually, intentionally or not, something of a simile. This is perhaps because people sort of lack a vocabulary for saying precisely what they mean.<br/><br/>I might be wrong, but this is what the exchange looks like to me:<br/><br/><b>Civil rights activist A:</b> "We should be hostile to bad ideas and use our liberty of association to shun bad people. That's the only way to take the strength away from fascists."<br/><br/><b>Civil rights activist B:</b> "I don't think that it is a good idea to compromise on free speech in our fight against fascism. If we do, we're just as bad as them. We should rather confront them in public and conduct ourselves better than they do, thus showing the fence-sitters the hollowness of their creed."<br/><br/><b>Civil rights activist A:</b> "But this is not about free speech, they can go speak elsewhere. I am only advocating for social shunning, not curtailing legal rights."<br/><br/>Now, the bit where these two people are misunderstanding each other occurs at the moment when activist B chooses to characterize his issue as a "free speech" problem, attempting to bolster his stance with a call-back to a cherished value of free society. I do not believe that this is what B actually intends - as A rightly remarks, people do not actually have a compulsory duty to listen to other people's free speech. I believe that what B is getting at is somewhat more subtle, and by dressing it up with this particular term he ends up derailing his argument.<br/><br/>What is the real problem B has, then? I think it is that he believes that patient political discourse even with your opponents is an utmost virtue, because when you stop talking and start treating other people as strictly external enemies, that's the first step towards true hostility: once you stop talking to each other you've fulfilled one of the basic requirements on the road towards the moment when you are ready to e.g. kill another human being, full of belief in their monstrosity. This is the trend that activist B in that discussion is probably worried about, he's just explaining himself badly.<br/><br/>(If that scenario seems far-fetched, it's good to remember that people come into these discussions from very different backgrounds: for some a political debate like this is really important in terms of immediate social stakes; for some other people the debate might hold deep resemblance to past errors in the body politic of their own society; yet others might be participating just for entertainment. It is entirely credible that some people, when faced with anti-humanist radicalism, will react with violent shunning, while others will react by trying their hardest to maintain the bridges of communication so as to avoid further radicalization between the camps.)<br/><br/>It would probably not be far off the mark to characterize these two activists, A and B, as being "radical" and "centrist" in political terms: A is approaching the problem of fascism as an external issue, an enemy to be purged by ostracizing them to death (figuratively). For B the greater threat of fascism is not necessarily fascism itself, but rather the societal consequences of the fight: if the fight against fascism is conducted in a brutal way that treats people without empathy, then this will, so B fears, lead into further aggravation of relations - a cycle of hostility that causes both sides to lay aside words and take up arms instead. From his viewpoint things could be so much worse than they already are, and at least everything's still pretty good when the fascists and anti-fascists are shouting at each other; better to continue debating than to start shunning each other. Even better if you can make friends despite political disagreements, and change each other for the better that way - B is, I think, a big believer in inherent value of human life.<br/><br/>Of course that's just my understanding - maybe some people involved in these discussions genuinely believe that free speech as a value of society is in peril.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460268">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460268/#Comment_460268" name="Item_108" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-15T17:31:19+00:00" title="February 15, 2017  5:31PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like a good analysis to me, Eero.

We should rather confront them in public and conduct ourselves better than they do, thus showing the fence-sitters the hollowness of their creed."<br/><br/><b>Civil rights activist A:</b> "But this is not about free speech, they can go speak elsewhere. I am only advocating for social shunning, not curtailing legal rights."</blockquote>\nRather than inventing straw men and pushing words into other people's mouths, Eero, I think it is better to clarify one's own position and/or ask questions about others. <br/><br/>Personally, I think that both A and B have idiotic ideas. While social shunning might potentially have some effect, I think it is self-evidently nonsensical to suggest that it is the <b><i>only</i></b> way to take strength away from fascists. Meanwhile, B espouses "no better than them" which falsely implies equivalence between any wrongs - and also fails to suggest broader concrete action. A also is wrong about legal free speech in this debate - JArcane specifically blamed the ACLU for the resurgence of white nationalism in the U.S., so this is in part about legal free speech. <br/><br/>As for social shunning, I'm not convinced it necessarily has any power in being anti-fascist. Let's say that Jugenbewegung are organizing in my town in 1924 Germany. I decide to not inviting those kids (or their parents and supporters) to my games. I'm not convinced that this has any significant reduction in strength to the fascists, let alone be the only way they can be fought. I'm curious if you have any arguments that this social shunning is the best and only thing to do in the situation. <br/><br/>As for actions to take:  I think holding public youth events that are vocally anti-fascist would be one action. Education is another big one - helping and supporting teachers who speak out against fascism. Organizing armed self-defense is another, given the fascist tendency to strong-arm techniques; as is charging them legally when they step over that line.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460274/#Comment_460274" name="Item_110" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-15T19:05:48+00:00" title="February 15, 2017  7:05PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess I did not explain my point very well at all there <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460275/#Comment_460275" name="Item_111" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-15T19:19:40+00:00" title="February 15, 2017  7:19PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fair enough, Eero. <br/><br/>To get to something more concrete - recently, you had the suggestion of a code of conduct for a discussion forum, namely: \n<blockquote>* Organic nation state is a superior form of political organization.<br/>* Corporatism is a superior economic model for national welfare.<br/>* An authoritative leader expressing the organic national will is the best solution for organizing the government.<br/>* A secret police or actively repressive party apparatus is necessary for maintaining the purity of the organic national ideal against various sorts of fifth-columnists.<br/>* The struggle of civilizations is the purpose of history, with the weak and the deficient falling to ruin while the strong push history forward; it is imperative to join in this struggle to become part of the grand narrative of civilization.<br/><br/>So an anti-fascist code of conduct for a discussion forum would perhaps be one that forbids endorsing and defending those ideas, right?</blockquote>\nFirst of all, I can't clearly picture how it would be implemented. What would it look like for someone to be warned or banned from game discussion for endorsing an organic nation state? Given that, could you express how doing so would effectively fight fascism in the wider world?                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460276">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460276/#Comment_460276" name="Item_112" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-15T19:25:27+00:00" title="February 15, 2017  7:25PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps my wit has simply grown hopelessly dull.
