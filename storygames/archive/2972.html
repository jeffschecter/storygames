Where did the Nerdly Poker Chips come from?  (I assume I can price things when I discover the source.)  Are there other sources of other potential handouts?<br/><br/><br/>Less cryptically - my family lives in Columbus and for the past several years my wife and I have hosted a BBQ and gaming night on Saturday of the Con at our home.  We're off the beaten track, but it is a good excuse for a bunch of friends to get together outside of the insanity of the Con.  The event started as a way for us to bring friends together, but the group continues to grow. I like the idea that Nerdly participants are getting back together to exchange chips gotten at Nerdly and would like to experiment with replicating that.<br/><br/>Sometimes we have themes and sometimes we don't. We're toying with a Tropical/Luau theme with fake lais and the like this year, but nothing is in stone.  I would love to hear what ideas anyone else has.<br/><br/>Blue                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_67584">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67584/#Comment_67584" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-08T11:56:17+00:00" title="May  8, 2007 11:56AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 8, 2007 11:58AM by Remi.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Blue! The Nerdly poker chips were done through <a href="http://www.chipsandgames.com/" rel="nofollow">chipsandgames.com</a>, which does custom foil stamping. You can't really tell from the pictures, but the designs on the poker chips are very shiny. They ended up being the best/cheapest option for what I wanted (one-color design on a dice-design poker chip), but there are lots of places that do this sort of thing.<br/><br/>The chips cost about 22 cents each, and I bought 900 for Nerdly in 5 colors. However, the custom dies for each side cost  $125 total, which was about a third of the total price. If it was decided to re-use one of the dies (like the Owlbear design) for a chip reprint, though, we wouldn't be charged another set-up fee and the chips from here on would be $.22.<br/><br/>There are lots of places that do custom chips, cups, hats, and all that jazz. Just shop around until you find what you want. For Nerdly I wanted at least 10 chips for each camper, and at a lot of the other places the per-chip cost was around $.35-$.45, even for one screen-printed color! There are also really, really awesome custom metal coins, but those can run $3-$10 apiece or more, depending on the options you want and the quantities you order.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_67586">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67586/#Comment_67586" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-08T12:02:29+00:00" title="May  8, 2007 12:02PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good to know, Remi.

I am particularly intrigued by the collectable aspect that some of the attendess are placing on the chips, but you are right there are definitely options beyond chips that may fit my goals.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_67599">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67599/#Comment_67599" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-08T12:34:35+00:00" title="May  8, 2007 12:34PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Good to know, Remi.
