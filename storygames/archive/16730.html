So I'll be running MH in a month or two when I go 'home' to visit my partner in Canada. After pitching the game, folks a pretty excited, but the consensus is for more of a <i>True Blood</i> or <i>Being Human feel</i>, rather than the more high-school focused <i>Twilight.</i><br/><br/>I get what Joe is saying on p.127 about needing a the PCs being in the midst of a major transition and ramp up the alienation for the game to work at its best, but I need help for an equivalent replacement to the 'high school seating chart'. Has anyone run a 20 something game? How did you approach this part of the first session and 'situation setting'? How do you establish a social milieu other than the homeroom? <br/><br/>It seems logical that after following them around, the party, the fight and the disappearance would work just as well with a postgrad game, except that responsibilities are a little more complex - Shared housing, part-time jobs, college, fringe society and so forth, but is there any other 'sure fire' situation that may answer a stake other than just throwing named characters together and seeing what their chemistry is like?<br/><br/>I really like visual aids in my 'World games that highlight the 'drive' of each particular iteration; a map of scarcity and want for AW, a web of monster instincts and danger for DW, but I feel stumped for MH....  How do I populate the social milieu when its not a classroom and what sorts of provocative questions should I be working toward? SO their relationships with NPCs aren't highschoolers, they are... What? Is there something obvious I'm missing? What kind of visual aids could I use?<br/><br/>Thanks for your help everyone <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_382428">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tore_V" title="Tore_V"><img alt="Tore_V" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tore_V">Tore_V</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382428/#Comment_382428" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-15T09:56:13+00:00" title="June 15, 2012  9:56AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The way I see it, you just need a social setting of some sort with several people as initial setup. A work environment (think cubicle hell), softball team, football team... Even among adults, say in an office landscape, you can see the same cutthroat rivalry and backstabbing you'd see in highschool. You'd just see people more used to hiding it.<br/><br/>As for the stakes, I can easily see things evolving naturally during play. Borrow a page from Primetime Adventures and ask your players to set a scene now and again. Trust your players. It's what I, personally, have a hard time doing, but when I do, wonderful stories emerge.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_382441">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382441/#Comment_382441" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-15T12:14:40+00:00" title="June 15, 2012 12:14PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 15, 2012 12:17PM by mease19.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd totally do a minimum wage service job.

Have them be the assistant manager or something. So the other characters have someone to be mad at when they don't like their shift. And someone to butter up when they want more/less/better shift slots. And someone to accuse other people of sleeping with when the other people get more/less/better shifts.<br/><br/>And you should try to do something to emulate the tension between wanting to work and make money and wanting to not work and be out having fun. I think you get that tension best if the job has a tips element, because weekends are often the busiest time with the most income, but also the time when you want to be elsewhere and having fun instead of working.<br/><br/>So, yes, I agree that it should be set in a place that is tips-oriented and hangout-oriented employment (a coffee shop comes to mind as the most obvious way to have both). But you should structure it so that the ideal way to spend a Saturday night is definitely NOT hanging out at the job, but going out elsewhere, like the awesome club with the big cover charge and pricey drinks that they can only afford to go to if they work lots of shifts, preferably on Saturday nights. So you have a nice catch-22.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_382744">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382744/#Comment_382744" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-18T20:22:37+00:00" title="June 18, 2012  8:22PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and being post high school age, many of them will be taking college courses, in addition to working and trying to have a social life.

One regular shift worth of tips is 1-Tips, 2-Tips in a prime shift.  Some shifts give 0-Tips.  The table (or assistant manager) can decide which are the good and bad slots when you set up the game but before allocating initial shifts.<br/><br/>What would you use them for- ideas?  Bribery, obviously, maybe a bit like Strings.  Paying the cover charge, flashing a bit of cash, buying new shoes or buying drinks for the hottie who was totes checking you out (Spend 1-Tips for +1 Forward to Turn Someone On).<br/><br/>Depends how bookkeepy you want to get, you could deduct monthly upkeep.  But that's not very feral.  I do feel you would need some way to drain tips, presenting not-boring choices between necessities and wants.  My preference would be to just use hard moves- your slum landlord is leering at you in your doorway, saying you gotta pay for breakages from the party, that'll be 4-Tips by Sunday or you're out, bond forfeited.  But you promised to take Sam to that hot new restaurant tomorrow night... and the landlord may be amenable to... <i>persuasion</i>.
