I posted about it <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=9977&amp;page=1#Item_17" rel="nofollow">here</a> if you're interested in the background but that's not necessary for this topic.<br/><br/>I started working on the game again and am stuck between 3 choices.  Last time I polled SG and you guys helped me out a lot - thus I'm coming back for some more help.  <br/><br/>When you receive damage in the game you will receive 1 or more Scars.  Once you receive enough Scars you are dead/gone/whatever, but you also roll Scars as a stat so the more you have the more likely you are to succeed outside of battle (battle being similar to Firefight! in BE and Platoon Conflict in Diaspora).  This enforces a key theme that desperation leads to aggression, danger, and action.<br/><br/>Scars are kind of like the buy-off condition for a Key.  When you receive damage the rest of the table quickly discusses what the Scar should be.  The receiving player has input but does not have final say.  This is not a PVP or competitive game, the group deciding merely allows shared authorship for the table to put interesting flags on your character and to push you in a direction you may have not foreseen.<br/><br/>Originally Scars were going to be discreet character goals such as "Sabotage Reiker's Mech", "Squash the Algri uprising", "Betray the Patriarch", etc.  Almost like the opposite of Bangs, rather, they're the outcomes.  The excitement would be seeing how the character would navigate this situation and deal with the adversity of the action.  There will be an option to say "Hell No!" and cross the scar off without meeting the condition but it will have its own, more dire, consequences.<br/><br/>Anyway, I currently am throwing around 3 different options for Scars:<br/><br/>-The original way as seen above.  Precise actions to cross the Scar off<br/><br/>-Similar to the original way but more general.  Examples include - "Betray a loved one", "Sabotage an ally", "Poison a populace's collective mind."  The player would then have the opportunity to define who he at least wants to do this to.<br/><br/>-The third option would be for the table to hit the character with a Bang.  So when you get a Scar we decide "Riots in Urstyl", "Less is sleeping with the Patriarch", "The Wolfpack's morale is low."  Basically we're saying, "We want to see the character deal with this problem."  I feel this is less interesting than the first two but probably will produce more even play.<br/><br/>What do you think and which do you prefer?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_326595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326595/#Comment_326595" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-26T21:10:41+00:00" title="May 26, 2011  9:10PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like it all so far.  I'd encourage you not to persue the softer, third option.<br/><br/>Creative players will find plenty of ways of "interpretting" even the most direct goal.  And I like how they seem petty and stupid and very very human.<br/><br/>Maybe you could reward them for bringing in another person?  Like if they confess their goal to another character, they have the option of making it more broad and less vicious?<br/>("Betray" seems so much less specific and less harmful than "Sabotage someone's Mech").  It just seems to me like it's a great opportunity to pick a player behavior and reward the character for it.<br/><br/>Just my two cents.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_326604">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326604/#Comment_326604" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-26T22:27:46+00:00" title="May 26, 2011 10:27PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To answer the question directly, yes forcing goals on players is wrong, but throwing bangs at them is fine.<br/><br/>As for the mechanic in general, associating (I presume) physical damage with either an arbitrary goal or bang seems 'off' to me.

Can I ask the reasoning behind that?</blockquote>\nThe reasoning is similar to the reasoning of presenting the player with a tough choice in the form of a Bang.  The difference is that instead of choosing between two tough options the player is choosing how to deal with the more limited situation and we're all eagerly sitting at the table waiting to see how it turns out.  <br/><br/>I know my group loves those moments where we're all trying to hash out stakes and someone comes up with an awesome idea for another player and we're all like "Yes!  That's hot shit."  <br/><br/>I personally think Scars being goals given to you by other players will produce a very interesting narrative where when you sit down to play you have no idea where things are going to go.  I totally think this won't be for everyone but there was a lot of positive reception in that original thread so I know some will like it.  Treating the ownership of character in a non-traditional way is certainly going to ruffle some people's feathers but I think it will also produce stellar, exciting play for others.  <br/><br/>And, the reason damage is associated with an arbitrary goal is to enforce that going off to war has consequences and repercussions back home.  Part of the game is keeping your shit together (shit being family, the home front, your nation, whatever), and war messes with all that you've built up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_326628">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326628/#Comment_326628" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-27T05:37:15+00:00" title="May 27, 2011  5:37AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I vote for <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>!
