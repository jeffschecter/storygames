In my case it can be boiled down to a handful of factors:<br/><br/><b>1.) High-concept</b> - Most of the people I've described it to thought it was interesting, but not something they'd find compelling to play. For anyone whose roleplaying expectations are set squarely within 'shooty-fighty-high adventure', Freemarket is a totally alien experience. What? You can't die? Nobody can die? Wealth is meaningless?<br/><br/><b>2.) Demanding</b> -  It suffers greatly from 'What do I do now?'. I suspect the fact that you can do <i>anything</i> is a prospect that some players find imposing. Clyde Rhoer brought this up on the podcast a little while back; when faced with a setting that asks this much of you as a player, it can be hard to cope with the sheer number of possibilities available to you. I also had some trouble getting players to wrap their heads around the game's social economy; i.e. the give and take of Flow. They felt like they were always on the verge of being broke, but didn't quite understand that with a little proactive roleplaying and interaction they could easily bump their flow up.<br/><br/>I still really want to run a Freemarket campaign but I think it will require a very specific group of players whose tastes align with mine. I also should say, this isn't me saying 'All the players I ran this for suck!'. I suspect partly it was my inability to coax them into the mechanics; if I run it again it's something I'll have to be mindful of.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_380960">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ethan%20K." title="Ethan K."><img alt="Ethan K." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2475/3619178655_cd765940c5_s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ethan%20K.">Ethan K.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380960/#Comment_380960" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-06T07:40:51+00:00" title="June  6, 2012  7:40AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: AlexMayo</cite>I still really want to run a Freemarket campaign but I think it will require a very specific group of players whose tastes align with mine.</blockquote>\nThis. A thousand times.<br/><br/>The game is so fierce and balls-to-the-wall in the way it opens up play entirely to the character that it can't help but lead to shuffled feet and uncertainty. I know that, in comparison to a lot of the games I played when I first entered the hobby, the possibilities and control are so vast that it can lead to paralysis. The one game I played was pretty awesome, but it took us half the session to even develop our characters because we were coping with the system and it's possibilities - in the end we had a mood surgeon, a puzzle builder, an experience artist, and a cool synthesizer. I would love to play it, but when some players struggle to even roll with Apocalypse World, it can be a challenge to jump to Freemarket.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_380963">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380963/#Comment_380963" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-06T07:56:53+00:00" title="June  6, 2012  7:56AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I confess I had a really hard time nailing down the fun in the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_380972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380972/#Comment_380972" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-06T08:27:22+00:00" title="June  6, 2012  8:27AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is a very disturbing trend in my brain.  As the years pass, I find that learning <i>certain</i> new games just from the rules to be very difficult.  Usually it comes up with fairly deep board or war games.  But Freemarket is one too.  I've skimmed the rules and then started reading word-for-word and got about half way through before putting the book down.  I couldn't keep track of what everything was and how the cards worked -- like while reading the section on how to do a thing, it was all simple enough but then when reading the next chapter, it just evaporated out of my head.  I'm sure if someone else would learn it and run it, I'd be fine, but I'm the one with the copy in my local group.  Maybe I just need to work harder at it.

We're, what, 3 sessions (+chargen) in? And having a blast. We have our issues with the game--I've won nary a Challenge since the first session, as Superuser; the play tends to be mechanically driven and not fiction first--but really, I like it a lot and we all are having fun. I already know that I want to superuse/play this one more. I'd like to really learn the inner workings of it, and be able to reliably Superuse it well.<br/><br/>I think part of your answer, Matthijs, is that Freemarket is difficult. Not that it's incredibly difficult to learn how to play or run, but that it fucks with your expectations and asks you to <i>learn</i> how to play the game and change your approach to it over time. You can't just show up and push the story button, or show up and know how it all interlocks the first time (or three) you sit down to play it. It's much like Burning Wheel in that way. If you don't want a game that pushes back when you manipulate it and asks you to think about how it pushes back and change your approach from there, you won't like it.<br/><br/>I'm in the process of writing up a replay of one of our sessions, as an experiment. I'll let you know how that goes, and if its comprehensible, when I'm done.<br/><br/>I probably should post about it more, but I'm just really bad at writing AP--I can't edit myself very well, and I don't like bite-sized AP.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_380987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380987/#Comment_380987" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-06T09:35:04+00:00" title="June  6, 2012  9:35AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ran a bunch of Freemarket last year. It was super fun! It's true that the truly open sandbox nature of play makes it hard to know "what you're gonna get" before you start playing, unless you come to the game with a specific premise already in mind, and that's not really how it's meant to be played, I don't think. Because your MRCZ can be about and do literally anything, there's less of a concrete hook there. "Do anything" is really the hook. The resolution mechanics are also fun but they don't grab you by the face and demand that you engage with them, the way some games do (Mouse Guard and Dogs in the Vineyard come to mind as games that I would play just to watch the mechanics resolve stuff). So, after having played it a bit, I would be excited to play it again if someone else ran it, but I haven't been super excited to run it again or share it with other folks, for whatever reasons. There is definitely a bit of an intimidation factor too, I think, similar to Continuum or other games that defy normal setting conventions and expectations.  That said, everyone should play Freemarket! It's great.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_380989">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380989/#Comment_380989" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-06T09:41:30+00:00" title="June  6, 2012  9:41AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 6, 2012 9:41AM by Hans_c-o.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

To get the idea of how it plays, read <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?528474-Freemarket-Excramax" rel="nofollow">our AP</a> or the book <i>Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom</i>, which you can <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://craphound.com/down/" rel="nofollow">download for free</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've read other APs, and listened to podcasts, and I've never found someone else's game that sounded as fun or interesting as ours was. I don't mean to sound condescending, and I feel bad for saying it. And of course every session of any game will be different, and reading/listening to APs is very different from playing the game yourself. But I do suspect that Freemarket is more prone to failure than other games.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's some thoughts on how to improve your Freemarket experience. I wasn't the Superuser for our game, so take them with a grain of salt:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Lots of people seem to form a MRCZ, give themselves a goal, then doggedly pursue that goal and ignore anything else that happens. Don't do that. Let yourselves be derailed on a regular basis; go off on tangents. Try Hacking something just because you feel like trying Hacking even though it doesn't relate to your MRCZ.<br/>\n- Corollary: Superusers, do everything in your power to distract the MRCZ from their 'mission'. Be aggressive. Distract them with shiny things. If you do it right their passion for their goal will last as long as the global enthusiasm for Kony 2012. Bring in the Next Big Thing. Then do it again, and again. Our SU was particularly good at this.<br/>\n- Social conflict, social conflict. Superusers, bully your Users into taking contracts they don't want. Users, browbeat NPCs into buying into your MRCZ's ridiculous crap. If you're defeated, go with it and see where failure takes you. It might not have dice but the game is definitely a cousin of Burning Wheel.<br/>\n- The rules say, create your characters, <b>then</b> create your MRCZ. It's not a mistake. <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.thewalkingeye.com/?p=854" rel="nofollow">Read the rules, and follow them</a>.<br/>\n- Death is not permanent, so it isn't scary. What is scary is loss of control of your life. Being stuck in a cubicle with high-fiving douchebags because you agreed to it because you wanted something in return and you wanted to be liked and now you're in a place you hate but you can't leave because your flow will tank and nobody will like you anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Posted By: Hans c-o&lt;/cite&gt;We have our issues with the game--I've won nary a Challenge since the first session, as Superuser&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI dimly recall our Superuser also had this problem. I think it was because we weren't following the rules properly. Something to do with the order of play; if the Superuser does/doesn't take their turn first/last like they're supposed to, they can't Call the conflict early and it's harder for them to win. Go over those rules very carefully and make sure you're following them to the letter.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did have a few issues with the game:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Our characters had big Flow inflation where it would keep going up and up and we had nothing to 'spend' it on. I don't know if we ever worked out why that was the case. Might have been related to not losing enough conflicts as above.<br/>\n- The game says four players max but we had five and I don't think our game suffered for it. We just ruled that only four players could participate in each conflict.<br/>\n- Geneline keywords are really important. They're really hard to change (one character class can't change them at all) and if you can never fit your keywords to your conflicts your effectiveness is seriously diminished. I also recall complaining that the example characters had useless, vague keywords. Think about them very carefully. And Superusers, keep a close eye; don't let the players take Genelines like "good at everything".<br/>\n- If I ever ran this game myself I would ban the Repair skill. Just wipe it off the character sheets altogether. Our characters burnt through our stuff all the time and then at the end of every session we would argue about whether we should take half an hour to run Repair 'conflicts' for every single thing we burned. So, so boring, and it doesn't fit the world anyway. If you burn something, either throw it away or Recycle it into something different and new.<br/>\n<br/>\nGod I loved this game. Reading the first posts of the AP was actually what got me into RPGs as an adult and I haven't looked back. I played the character Wilbert (TM) who appears halfway through.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_381152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/boulet" title="boulet"><img alt="boulet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/534/nTWF4B3HT5CT6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/boulet">boulet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381152/#Comment_381152" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-07T06:42:04+00:00" title="June  7, 2012  6:42AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>However, it's a lot of overhead to learn.

I mean, <i>Paranoia</i> is largely based around the kind of Prisoner's Dilemmas found in totalitarian societies.  <i>Freemarket</i> actually contains similar scenarios (i.e. do something really simple that, in the future, is horribly complex!) and a similar aesthetic (i.e. zany future crap whizzing and flitting all over the place).  But the Prisoner's Dilemma society is replaced with the vagaries of a computer-governed Network Society <i>without</i> the necessary microelectronics to govern its intricacies.  So whereas one knows how to comport oneself in a totalitarian fiction, one doesn't necessarily have the tools to make the Network Society work for them.<br><br>So at least <i>Freemarket</i> fails (for me) at a more sophisticated level than most games.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_381155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JackFractal" title="JackFractal"><img alt="JackFractal" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JackFractal">JackFractal</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381155/#Comment_381155" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-07T06:48:56+00:00" title="June  7, 2012  6:48AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excramax!

In group challenges each player gets the full rebate. So if it was a 30 flow challenge ("Field, grove"), and the group got a 50% rebate, each member would get 15 Flow. The jungle was a group cultivation challenge, I believe:\n<blockquote><cite>From the Excramax thread:</cite>Next, they head out and find a likely spot to cultivate a rainforest. Taking some time, and with the help of the Janissary Wind who had promised to help them out in return for a place to stay, they set up the rainforest, force growing trees and plants, flowers and grasses. Bandy Needo leads the cultivation, directing the others. The hard surfaces are hard to graft bio matter onto, and Aggie tries toc lean up the mess before they manage to reprogram the sweeps and get them to accept the jungle as part of the corridor.<br><br>The jungle is a tremendous success - they are suddenly awash with flow as people recognise their achievement, and walk through the newly junglified section of the corridor. They celebrate at a nearby cafe, where people gift them coffees and beverages. They are treated like rockstars.</br></br></blockquote>\n<br>edit: clarified flow stuff                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381175">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381175/#Comment_381175" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-07T08:36:17+00:00" title="June  7, 2012  8:36AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jim Crocker</cite>I wonder how much of it is that as a retailer I spend my full-time work<i>already</i>engaged in what the game is presenting as novelty: a mix of social engineering and convincing people they want unnecessary things; it was an RPG that made me feel completely incompetent at my chosen professional career, one that I am reasonably good at in real life.

(your thoughts, that is, on being a retailer full time then seeing your job -- which involves a lot of peddling and marketing -- in your game)<br><br/>This is the main reason I ultimately gave up on D&amp;D 3e until Ryan S's E6 hack: At level one, I had to make choices about my character NOW in feats and skills that would impact me much later: If I wanted to take Feat X, a powerful feat, as early as possible (level 12), then I'd have to take Y at 6th level, Z at 3rd level, and A and B at first level.<br/>At the time, I had just returned to the US from living overseas, and was basically restarting my career over from scratch in a new field, and doing lots of training for it. THe single most thing I stressed out about daily was "What do I learn next? If I want Job X, I need to learn This now, and That later, and That Thing after that... but if I do that, that will close me off from Job Y, which is also extremely interesting. I could learn This and This and This now, but that would increase my overall learning but would stymie me from getting Job X/Y faster..." ovre and over again. <br/><br/>And when I saw it in my game, weekly, I had to fucking walk away.<br/><br/>-=-=-=-<br/><br/>I definitely had the same reactions to Freemarket as others: I love the concept, but really had no idea of where to begin. Someone last year (a huge fan of the game who ran it a lot) at CN organized a session of it which I played: It clicked! I understood the play, the setting, the back and forth, and determined how to Start. But that guy learned how to play from someone else. And THAT person learned how to play by being in a session run by Jared. It's a viral game! You have the rules to play, but to get that further injection of "what to do" or cool descriptions of the little nuances of Donut society, you need to have played in a session with someone who played in a session with someone who... back to the designers.<br/><br/>...which is why I really think Freemarket needs a replay or actual play podcast or something. Spread the virus without having to have played with someone connected back to the designer.

I've played in two sessions and run five or six, including two con games (one at camp nerdly, one at burning apocalypse).  I think it's a fine con game as long as people are aware it's kind of demo-y in nature, since character generation is both crucial and kind of time-consuming for a 4-hour slot.  Oh, and as long as the GM is prepared to teach the rules quickly and efficiently - I have hand-outs.<br/><br/>My favorite thing about FreeMarket is that it makes goals like making art, running a business, into interesting and mechanically-supported gameplay.  I also love the weird group concepts it produces.  My least favorite thing is that it can easily a little too silly - I prefer it when it's kind of whimsical but the characters and their hopes and desires aren't a joke.  You absolutely need to play a sample conflict before making characters, otherwise it's too easy to make a character that's incompetent in something they're supposed to be good at.  A little explanation, though, and it should be fine.<br/><br/>I should note that the sessions I've played have all been 1-shots, for no particular reason.  I'd be interested to play a short campaign but haven't had the chance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381179">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381179/#Comment_381179" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-07T08:46:11+00:00" title="June  7, 2012  8:46AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>I really think <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Freemarket</span> <span style="color: #3300CC;">every novel game design</span> needs a replay or actual play podcast or something.</blockquote>Fixed that for you.... <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_381185">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JackFractal" title="JackFractal"><img alt="JackFractal" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JackFractal">JackFractal</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381185/#Comment_381185" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-07T08:56:41+00:00" title="June  7, 2012  8:56AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: stormsweeper</cite><br/>You can spend margin of victory on a rebate of flow invested (25, 50, or 75%).

Big long post incoming!<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me first say that I am having a hell of a lot of fun. The cards and the gamey stuff is really hot and irresistible. Also I whine. Loudly. Whatever complaints I have have not compromised my enjoyment of the game, and I think Hans is doing a damn good job.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy perceptions of Freemarket are based on about 12ish hours of play, and about that much conversation with some of the other players. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe biggest driving factor in my experience is Flow. You literally cannot try to do anything without it, and in order for you to pursue any goals or have any impact on station culture at all you have got to spend spend spend. However, when doing stuff on your own, there is no way to even break even on the Flow rebate, and what rebate you do get back it at the expense of actually being effective. It\u2019s kinda damned if you do damned if you don\u2019t. Not to mention going up against the SuperUser solo is tough.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe flip side of this is group conflicts, where you have a much better chance of stomping the SuperUser and can get huge amounts of Flow rebate. Our play has often focused around finding just about any excuse to fit other Users into conflicts, because why in the hell wouldn\u2019t you? It\u2019s the only reliable way to be effective and the only reliable way to get Flow.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is further exasperated by the Experiences. I don\u2019t have the book in front of me to check numbers, but my feeling is that the game itself values certain Experiences over others. It does this by assigning specific Flow values to certain tasks, which vary greatly between the various uses of the various Experiences. The result is that some Experiences are much better at gaining Flow than others, with results in that User being more able to do stuff than others, which results in that player being able to contribute more boldly than others. Granted, this is an oversimplified summary, but I have felt this each time we\u2019ve played.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy User\u2019s expertise is Ephemera, which is quite possibly the most Flow ineffective Experience in the book. My best bet to score Flow on par with other Experiences is to stage a public event and friend request everybody who saw it. I\u2019ve got like 270 outstanding friend requests, only of which a small fraction will confirm, which provides very little Flow, and comes with strings attached. Not to mention whether or not that any of that takes place is all up to the SuperUser. Admittedly that is a shittly thing to do to the SuperUser. Sorry Hans!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe result is that I feel like the game is telling me that what I\u2019m trying to do isn\u2019t worth doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then you\u2019ve got MRCZ stuff. When I read the text, it seemed to me that it was saying something to the tune of \u201cChange Station culture, and be changed by station culture.\u201d And it puts a huge emphasis on working together and MRCZs. You go through this process of designing your MRCZ and designating a goal or mission statement for your MRCZ. And the text is all like \u201cGo for it, as you grow your influence will grow to!\u201d It has a big section of MRCZ tier challenges to go with this.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is my biggest complaint. The tier challenges are ridiculously tough Flow wise. The only way a MRCZ - regardless of the fiction - to get Flow is at the end of the session, and then it\u2019s only a tiny little bit, and maybe you actually lose some. You might do a couple tier challenges in a six session game. You might even win one. But there is no way you are going to really advance as a MRCZ beyond that.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead, there is a way to infiltrate a high tier MRZC with creative applications of certain Experiences (there\u2019s a thread somewhere). But even if you do that, you can\u2019t change what the MRCZ is about, and there is seemingly no other way to become a high tier MRCZ. Is there another way? Perhaps, but I don\u2019t see it. I think MRCZ group challenges would fit thematically and mechanically, but those are explicitly not possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo this is where I feel the game may have lied to me. I need to check the actual claims made in the text before actually evaluating this. But in my interpretation the game says \u201cChange and be changed and let\u2019s see what comes of it\u201d which is very enticing. But when it gets down to gameplay it\u2019s more like \u201cvision vs. influence,\u201d which would be cool if (a) the text expressed this and (b) if mechanical expression of this wasn\u2019t \u201cconform or become irrelevant.\u201d Ultimately I chose the vision side of this, and at every turn the game has told me that my User and what he\u2019s doing it irrelevant. In my struggle to try and become relevant I have become a Flow whore as I try to exert influence while staying true to my vision. However, I doubt it will ever be possible for our MRCZ to ever become relevant, since the only way to have MRCZ influence is to abandon your MRCZ for a powerful one by use of the few character types the game allows to be useful.<br/>\n<br/>\nI\u2019m really curious what fiction-first gameplay would be like here, because the game seems to strongly incentivize gaming for Flow, and seems to grossly de-incentivize anything regarding narrative agendas. I wonder if I misunderstand this, but I can plainly see how my decisions in game are affected by the assorted game mechanisms, and I can\u2019t seem to get away from them. In my mind our Users in this game are essentially faceless and their doings trivial. There are a couple neat fictional things cropping up, but those are 100% Hans. The game itself doesn\u2019t seem to care for them. I know \u201cstory game\u201d is a nebulous term (and nebulously applied, as well), but I would, and do, hesitate to call Freemarket a story game in the sense that, say, Vincent Baker\u2019s games are story games. So yeah, tell me more about this.<br/>\n<br/>\nFreemarket is lucky that it\u2019s so very fun that these issues don\u2019t inhibit gameplay and the enjoyment thereof. I kind of like staging (in game) public performance art pieces that criticize the Freemarket way of life.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, I whine loudly but I am having fun Hans. Thanks for running this with such enthusiasm, and double thanks for putting up with assholes like me.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut seriously guys. If I'm way off here tell me about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nTayler                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_381272">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381272/#Comment_381272" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-07T14:37:38+00:00" title="June  7, 2012  2:37PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We had a lot of fun with it.

href="http://www.thewalkingeye.com/?p=854" rel="nofollow">the Walking Eye interview</a> to your concern, Tayler: Being an artist is fucking hard. Joshua Bell, a brilliant violinist, played Bach in a subway station during rush hour and six people stopped to listen to him.<br/><br/>I think you're right that the game's built to make you feel that. I love that idea, in theory, but it's easy for me to love it as the Superuser on high, not having to <i>feel</i> it.<br/><br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: quincunx</cite><br/>I\u2019m really curious what fiction-first gameplay would be like here, because the game seems to strongly incentivize gaming for Flow, and seems to grossly de-incentivize anything regarding narrative agendas.

I don't think game mechanisms affecting decisions plainly has anything to do with fiction-first; that's just what a game does, right?<br/><br/>Could you talk a little more about what you mean by narrative agendas? As a Superuser, the only agenda I hope you guys have is to have a character that cares about something and goes for it. Or cares about multiple things and decides what to do.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: quincunx</cite>I know story game is a nebulous term (and nebulously applied, as well), but I would, and do, hesitate to call Freemarket a story game in the sense that, say, Vincent Baker\u2019s games are story games.</blockquote>\nI'm pretty sure Luke &amp; Jared will yell at the top of their lungs that this is a roleplaying game, not a story game.

In much of the speculative fiction that has defined the post-human/trans-human/post-scarcity/post-death genres/subgenres/whatever, art has been very highly valued.

Yay!<br/>\n<br/>\nRe: Fiction-first/"Narrative agenda"<br/>\nFor some reason I took you a little differently. Probably I wasn't actually listening to you and was just hearing my own thoughts and feelings.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I mean is that what my character wants, does, feels, hopes, etc. doesn't seem to matter. They don't inform my gameplay decisions, either. It starts and ends with flow, and what come before, after and in between is basically window dressing for the conflicts. With a couple of exceptions, the fiction is pretty thin, and hasn't really built a story beyond a series of events that just kind of happened. But hey, if the game isn't about that that's still cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, the parts where the fiction is robust is due to your efforts to push our buttons and whatnot. I don't think the game cares at all about that, and I'm certainly not helping by acing the part of a ravenous flow fiend.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps the "story" is more of the player's experience playing it, in which case I apparently have a rather detailed story that I want to share.<br/>\n<br/>\nTayler                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_381364">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Russell" title="Russell"><img alt="Russell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Russell">Russell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381364/#Comment_381364" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-08T01:33:34+00:00" title="June  8, 2012  1:33AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 8, 2012 1:34AM by Russell.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/><br/>I presume the AP is eliding that those are efficiency rebates from a group challenge.</blockquote>\nCorrect.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381365">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Russell" title="Russell"><img alt="Russell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Russell">Russell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381365/#Comment_381365" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-08T01:37:58+00:00" title="June  8, 2012  1:37AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jim Crocker</cite>"the goal was for them to make (cultivate) a cup of coffee.

If you can get to 50 by the end of session 2, that's probably enough to reform and get to Tier 3 (with some free data!) by the end of "session"* 4.  Grind up to tier 4 when you're around 130 Flow.  That's probably a good place to hang out until you can get enough founders to the 600+Flow you seem to need to take a run at Tier 7.<br/><br/>* Exactly what happens if the MRCZ wants to run multiple Tier challenges in a physical session is kind of vague.  Do you run the "start of session" procedure between each?  If a 150+Flow Tier 1 MRCZ wants to run three tier challenge in a row, is that three "sessions"?  Three long term memories upgraded?

Freemarket is at its core a dystopia (albeit a potentially more fun one).

Generally speaking you don't use violence to make people dead, unless you're doing so for a very specific reason. When people die, they lose memories and sometimes interface (enhancements) or modifications. Memories are currency. They're how you improve your character.

More fun than playing with yourself. Were it not for this I would not put up with my other frustrations. That said, never before have I found a game so irritating yet I keep on coming back to it week after week.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow. I\u2019m all fired up, so pardon me if I get over excited.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are two areas areas of considerable narrative dissonance - which is to say it don\u2019t make any damn sense. These really chaff my sack.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Experience tags on Interface and Tags suck. Let\u2019s say I\u2019ve got a big knife. It\u2019s tagged Wetwork, you know, for the cuttin\u2019 people up. That is the ONLY application for that knife. I cannot (read: the game says it is wholly ineffective to) threaten or intimidate with that knife, I cannot prepare a meal with that knife. Similarly, we could have three identical knives, except one is Exp. tagged with Wetwork, one Cultivation, and the other Social Engineering (or whatever you threaten with). So what the hell? Why is it I have this knife that can be used to kill, and the other guy has the exact same knife that only be used to scare me? Why do I have to carry two identical knives around one for scaring one for killing? Why do I have a third at home for cooking? Why do I have to go to a Recyler or a Mobber or whatever to get them to modify it, change only the tag and nothing else so I can use it elsewhere? What is the damn point when getting another knife is so easy? To make me run trivial errands to compensate for the fact that none of us can explain why a knife that can kill you isn\u2019t scary, and why a scary knife can\u2019t kill you?<br/>\n<br/>\nAn aside: Why the Sam Christ do Geneline tags and Interface/Tech tags work differently, but are called the same thing? This has caused us confusion on multiple occasions. So I\u2019m just going to say it. BAD GAME DESIGNERS, BAD - GO TAKE A TIME OUT! NO PUDDING FOR YOU!<br/>\n<br/>\nAhem. Moving right along.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, we\u2019re in a Challenge. I\u2019m using Tech. No problem. I just say how I\u2019m using it and how that helps me. I draw Tech cards, I kick ass \u2018cause Tech kicks ass. Note that here my User is using the Tech. He knows how to use it, clearly, and it costs no Flow.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, now I\u2019m just trying to use the Tech for its designated purpose outside of a Challenge. No wait, that is a such and such Challenge just to use it. Pay Flow, draw cards, unless this is a Group Challenge, I probably either don\u2019t do well, or it costs a lot of Flow.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo which it is? Does my User know how to use the Tech or not? Does using it cost Flow or not? How on Earth is it that the Tech is easier to use my Dermal Inker in a Challenge that it is to use it is the privacy of my own bedroom when in both cases I\u2019m coloring my skin for dramatic effect?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is up with these blatant contradictions? Does this game care not for a sensible narrative at all?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy is it that I buy into the setting of the game, get excited about all of these themes and concepts, my head overflowing with neat ideas, and then I introduce it in the game and NOTHING works the way it logically should? I had some neat ideas for interfaces that would totally be possible with the technology described (\u201cimmortal telepathic infovores\u201d and whatnot) but in game only a fraction of it actually applies and none of the implications can be explored? Why do you get me hot and bothered for the setting and then shut down every ounce of creativity I bring to the table?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I want to know what the fuck Flow actually is. We had a long conversation last night after our game and we could not see how it represents reputation or resources, and social currency is too ambiguous to even be considered. So what the hell is it? How does it cost Flow to stand around pretending to be a statue (performance art), but not to stand around, perfectly still and idle? What does it mean to spend Flow on in a conversation? Why does it cost Flow to use my Tech when its use prompts a Challenge, but not when the Tech is used as a part of a different Challenge? Why can\u2019t I do ANYTHING, not even write poetry on my hand if I\u2019m out of Flow? Is taking a shit printing? Because we might be in trouble.<br/>\n<br/>\nWould it really kill the game to be more transparent about these things? I\u2019m not asking for a strategy guide to gaming the system, I\u2019m asking for an instruction manual that helps me understand the system. Is that really asking too much?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is an observation. Since this game pretty much takes a dump on any hope of a sensible narrative for the fictional Users, I would submit that the real story of playing this game takes place outside of the fiction. That is, the experiences and tribulations of the players grappling with the system is the story. The game rules are the same as those of Freemarket station, right? So as players we are literally doing that? So the player\u2019s story is just as valid as the User\u2019s? Except, the player\u2019s story is based on the decisions made in response to the game system, whereas the User\u2019s story is based on the decisions regarding the perplexing tale of the three knives.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I still don\u2019t buy the starving artist bit in such a society. It\u2019s true in America, but it\u2019s not true everywhere on Earth even, and I can\u2019t imagine that the capitalist pressures that starve the artist are similar to the social pressures of a society so radically different from ours.<br/>\n<br/>\n(See Hans, I did all my yelling on the internet!)<br/>\n<br/>\nTayler                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jared%20A.%20Sorensen" title="Jared A.

You don't need chef's knife tech to cut the lettuce. You don't even need lettuce tech. Doesn't cost flow. Not a challenge. Don't need to draw any cards.<br/><br/>Want to make salad tech (2)?

I don't think this answers Tayler's issue, though (if it can be answered to his satisfaction). He knows you can burn stuff, and has done it liberally. Basically he's saying that it doesn't make sense to him that a particular Meat Cleaver can only be tagged for Wetwork, and not, say, Social Engineering. I simply look at that and say, "Ok, that's how the game works. I'm not going to try to push my logic into the game, makes sense to me," etc. But for Tayler it seems to be an issue of suspension of disbelief getting broken.<br/><br/>ANYWAY:<br/><br/>Hey Tayler, so I was thinking about the "tags mean different things" issue. The thing is, they really don't. I think you're honing in on the "tags are exclusive" language with Tech &amp; Interface a little too closely and letting that confuse you.<br/><br/>You have tags on your Geneline, Tech, and Interface. Look at your Geneline tags. They tell you when your Geneline is appropriate for a challenge. And, conversely, when it's not. Look at your Tech and Interface tags. They tell you when your Tech and Interface are appropriate for a challenge. And, conversely, when they're not. Tags mean the same thing across the board: they tell us when this thing can help me in a challenge, and when it can't.<br/><br/>Look at the description for what Tech tags do (same for Interface tags):<br/><br/><i>The tags tell the superuser and the other<br/>users whether or not your tech applies to a<br/>challenge. Most of the time, if the experience<br/>applies, then the tech applies. But sometimes<br/>your other tags tell us that, due to the situation,<br/>your tech doesn\u2019t apply.</i><br/><br/>Those other tags aren't exclusive in the way you're talking about. Say I have a Meat Cleaver (1) tagged: Wetwork, Enormous, Crazy Sharp. I'm trying to sneak up on a guy and death him before he notices. It would seem the Meat Cleaver's not the best tool for this job: It's fuckin' huge. How are you going to sneak up on this guy with a Meat Cleaver? But it's also crazy sharp, so maybe I can slice him in one blow if I'm fast enough.<br/><br/>If the tags were strictly exclusive in the way you think they are, Tayler*, you couldn't use that Meat Cleaver in the above challenge because Enormous would rule it out. If the Experience tag applies, then you can probably use it. The other tags will give us more clarification on how it works such that we'll be able to see exactly which challenges it can and can't apply to. Geneline tags are the same thing, except there's no Experience tag. Your Curious tag may make it so it seems your Geneline doesn't apply to the above challenge, but your Quick tag makes it obvious to us all that your Geneline does apply.<br/><br/>Let me know if I'm making sense here, Tayler. It makes perfect sense to me (clearly).<br/><br/>*and some of this might be issues with remembering the text/having it be described poorly by me. Think about it: Have we ever had an issue with understanding how tags work in play? Have they ever seemed like different things such that they've stopped play while we've tried to figure it out? No. It makes sense in play, and then afterward, it seems to stop making sense to you--or you've overthought yourself into circles.<br/><br/><br/><br/>To keep this light, and to apologize for the thread-drift: Is Freemer culture taking over the world?

Thanks for responding. Sorry I'm kind of a dick. Mostly I'm frustrated. Evidently, the positive features of Freemarket do a great deal redeem the game in light of my vociferous complaints. I hope that that much is clear.<br/><br/>I think we could tighten our game up just a bit with your advice (Hans? Thoughts?). But ultimately you did not address my big questions - not even the concerns raised in the text you quoted. That could be mostly my fault. The two questions I meant to raise in the section you quoted are these:<br/><br/>Why is it that a knife that can kill you cannot be used to scare you?  (The Experience Tag for the item make it impossible to use the item for effect outside of that particular kind of Challenge.)<br/><br/>What is Flow really?<br/><br/>And a follow up question to your comment. How is it that I must Burn the knife for killing in order to scare you with the knife for killing? Why would that item need repair after merely threatening you with it?<br/><br/>The Flow question is less important than any of the other issues I raised. <br/><br/>The premise of Freemarket is sexy. Buying into it is exciting. But it is extremely frustrating when I have this great idea for a Character/Tech/Interface that is born from that premise buy in only for the game mechanics to contradict that premise by telling me no, it doesn't actually work that way. My user has an Interface that I made particularly for his purposes which can easily, effortlessly and sensibly be involved with no less than five Experiences. The premise told me all about these immortal transhuman telepathic infovores in a world without need, with new technology penetrating into basically every facet of human life, radically reinventing society. But the mechanics will not let me use my Interface the way the premise suggests that basically everything is used. I feel like there was a bait and switch somewhere and it kinda pisses me off. <br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/BRennekamp">@BRennekamp</a>:<br/>I totally get all of that. The trouble I have is that the way the Flow numbers change describe way, way more than just that, and it seems to treat reputation and resource use at best inconsistently and at worst (seemingly) contradictory. At this point I have no idea what it means other than "this little numbers game we play to do something to Freemarket the game."<br/><br/>Also, if Flow is reputation, what does it mean to use it efficiently? <br/><br/>Also also, in a previous post I said something to the tune of "I thought the theme of this game was to 'change and be changed by the evolving society'." I concede that this may be only in my own head, and is not in fact a promise made to me by the game text. This was frustrating to me because of the way my User's value is pre-judged my the relationship between Experiences and Flow, and how our MRCZ goal was automatically irrelevant, and how gain that influence/relevance MRCZ advancement (the few ways KNOWN TO ME) either subverts that (join a new MRCZ), takes an unplayably long time (slow climb session to session) or is counter intuitive to the extreme (disband, reband - what is this supposed to model, anyway?). But this statement:\n<blockquote>Want to stand still like a statue? Awesome. You did it. Want to infect others with a short term memory about your performance? That's an ephemera challenge. </blockquote>\nseems to reinforce my interpretation of Change and Be Changed. At least, I can see why I thought that, given the way Flow is spent to do things.<br/><br/>Which does raise a potentially interesting question about Flow: does Flow also model the Freemarket society's resistance to change? If so, I think it would be a very compelling statement about the premise.<br/><br/>Tayler<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/quincunx" title="quincunx"><img alt="quincunx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/quincunx">quincunx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381742/#Comment_381742" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-10T16:21:42+00:00" title="June 10, 2012  4:21PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Hans">@Hans</a>:<br/><br/>Here is how I read that text about tags:<br/><br/>You can use it if and only if it has the Experience tag of the Challenge in question, unless one of the other tags prevents you from doing so in the fiction.<br/><br/>I think we (mostly) agree on that, and that is not my complaint.<br/><br/>The thing is, those other two tags refer to the fiction.

I'm saying the term always means the same thing across the board, which you seem (?) to agree with, now.<br/><br/>Your concern is still the issue with using a knife for one thing and not the other, which I totally recognize hasn't been resolved (for you--and the other users in our game).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381750">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jared%20A.%20Sorensen" title="Jared A.

Then people immediately started to hack the system, giving people their allotment of resources when they didn't needed them. Like if I was able to let you use my Metrocard to access the NYC subways while I was at home. Later, it was further hacked and re-designed by the Aggregate and its users.<br/><br/>If you look at flow costs, you'll see patterns emerge. It costs more flow to break recycle tech than wetworking tech. Having the ephemera experience doesn't give you any extra flow. Flow is the Aggregate's measure of how life should be and how it is. It wants to make painful things expensive, but still allowable. This slows down painful progress (ie: breaking, switching, etc.) but still enables users with the "societal thumb's up" of a high flow level to go around hacking the station and improving it.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_381760">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/quincunx" title="quincunx"><img alt="quincunx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/quincunx">quincunx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381760/#Comment_381760" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-10T17:52:53+00:00" title="June 10, 2012  5:52PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Hans">@Hans</a>:<br/><br/>I did take it to mean that Geneline tags work differently from tags applied elsewhere.

It filled me with revulsion and terror for the future. It made me want to play Freemarket again for the same reason I'd like to play Kult.<br/><br/>The last paragraph is the best, and perfectly illustrates why Ephemera works the way it does:\n<blockquote>Over time, I found my eyes drifting to tweets from folks with the lowest Klout scores. They talked about things nobody else was talking about. Sitcoms in Haiti. Quirky museum exhibits. Strange movie-theater lobby cards from the 1970s. The un-Kloutiest\u2019s thoughts, jokes, and bubbles of honest emotion felt rawer, more authentic, and blissfully oblivious to the herd. Like unloved TV shows, these people had low Nielsen ratings\u2014no brand would ever bother to advertise on their channels. And yet, these were the people I paid the most attention to. They were unique and genuine. That may not matter to marketers, and it may not win them much Klout.

Some of the characters in our game feel like this--I don't have a great sense of who they are, as their users are very focused on gaming the system--and some of the characters feel more fleshed out, like the players are following their characters' instincts and are more interested in their character's or their MRCZ's goals.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_382033">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Russell" title="Russell"><img alt="Russell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Russell">Russell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382033/#Comment_382033" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-12T05:34:43+00:00" title="June 12, 2012  5:34AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the memory mashup is critical in getting people to play individuals - without those kickers the game can be very gamist.

I just want to put that personal request out there.)</i><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_382233">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil" title="Neil"><img alt="Neil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil">Neil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382233/#Comment_382233" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-13T17:38:39+00:00" title="June 13, 2012  5:38PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All this talk of Freemarket prompted me to offer a game of it at the Milton Keynes RPG club. <a href="http://www.mk-rpg.org.uk/Failing_Upward" rel="nofollow">We've only just started</a>, but it's shaping up to be a fun game!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_382240">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382240/#Comment_382240" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-13T18:51:05+00:00" title="June 13, 2012  6:51PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>All this talk of Freemarket prompted me to offer a game of it at the Milton Keynes RPG club. <a href="http://www.mk-rpg.org.uk/Failing_Upward" rel="nofollow">We've only just started</a>, but it's shaping up to be a fun game!</blockquote>\nAwesome.

I've read, and tried to sell to a convention play group, FreeMarket. I now realize that I should try pitching to a different audience - my cow orkers. They would totally eat that up! We actually live (much of) our work lives on Facebook, and you've nailed it. <br/><br/>Sweet Ford, are we ever decentralized post-scarcity reputation-economy infovores. You nailed it so hard, Andy. You reframed my entire last few months with a throwaway comment. Attaboy!<br/><br/>Also: Facebook beats the tar out of <i>Brazil</i> or <i>Paranoia</i>.
