One player, the Narrator, acts like the narrator of a story or the director of a play. The Narrator sets the scene and describes what happens in the world around your character. Then the other players decide what their characters do, the Narrator describes the outcome of those actions, and o\ufb00 you go, spinning your own story.<br/><br/>Roleplaying is much like cooperative fan \ufb01ction or simulation gaming, where players work together to build a fun and exciting story. Although it\u2019s the Narrator\u2019s job to portray the various antagonists in the story, as well as the heroes\u2019 allies, the Narrator isn\u2019t playing against everyone else. In fact, it\u2019s the Narrator\u2019s job to work with the players to ensure everyone has fun and the group tells an enjoyable story.<br/><br/>Think of a roleplaying game like an extended version of the various games of make believe we all played as children, only with rules to help guide the story and a central Narrator to help set the stage and keep things moving along. -- <b>True20 Adventure Roleplaying, 2005</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387795">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB" title="PeterBB"><img alt="PeterBB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB">PeterBB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387795/#Comment_387795" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-22T14:32:19+00:00" title="August 22, 2012  2:32PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Observation: The Call of Cthulhu rules are very clear and make perfect sense.

The Games Master plans a story in his mind and on paper which will be played out by the others. In this particular game the Games Master will design a story (or Mission) set in the world of the Corporations where high-tech weaponry, espionage and cybernetically augmented Agents are among the key elements.<br/><br/>The players are then required to make characters. These characters are assumed identities that the players take through the mission created by the Games Master. The character you design can be anything you like, within certain parameters.

A role playing game is played by a group of players and a Game Master (GM). If you are a player, you create and control a character called a player character (PCs). If you are a Game Master, you create and control the plot and setting. The plot is the scenario that the GM presents to the players. ink of the plot as a story from a book, movie, or television program, except as a player, you control one of the main characters (your PC). The setting is the world your PCs inhabit. Like the real world, the setting is governed by laws (game mechanics) and filled with other people called non-player characters (NPCs). The GM controls all the NPCs in the setting. The Game Master also functions like a referee, deciding which rules apply to a given situation. When players decide what actions their PCs take, the GM tells them what kind of rolls to make to determine their success. -- <b>Terror Network, 2009</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_387798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387798/#Comment_387798" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-22T14:51:14+00:00" title="August 22, 2012  2:51PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Observation: The Call of Cthulhu rules are very clear and make perfect sense.

Like the name implies, it is about playing a role, essentially a version of the childhood game of \u201clet\u2019s pretend\u201d with rules and dice used to determine the outcome of actions. Although roleplaying games have been around in various forms for decades, they haven\u2019t changed all that much from the childhood essentials \u2014 up to and including sometimes protracted \u201cDid so!\u201d \u201cDid not!\u201d arguments, thus the need for a Game Master.<br/><br/>Essentially, the Game Master is both narrator and referee. The GM comes up with a situation, the start or \u201chook\u201d of a story, and presents it to the players. They, in turn, decide what their characters will do. The GM responds with what happens next, and from their interaction a complete story unfolds. Along the way, the heroes encounter challenges, including fights with villains, and the game rules help the players and Game Master to resolve the outcome of those challenges, changing the direction of the story. A part of the thrill of a roleplaying game is that it is fiction you and your friends create together! -- <b>ICONS Superheroic Roleplaying, 2010</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_387800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387800/#Comment_387800" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-22T14:56:47+00:00" title="August 22, 2012  2:56PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 22, 2012 11:41PM by JDCorley.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Director: The Director is a player who brings to the table the seeds for the story, and portrays any characters not portrayed by Players.

MMORPGs, LARPs, role-playing chats online, kids playing cops and robbers, sexual role-playing games, free-form and traditional roleplaying games. They are all a structured form of play, and you role-play in all of them.<br/><br/>But you don\u2019t have to like them. Using an inclusive label only means that you recognize they, too, are different kinds of role-playing games in some sense of the word."</blockquote>\n<blockquote>"Neither will it become impossible to discuss your favorite form of role-playing. When we need exclusive terms, we can use exclusive terms. We can say that something isn\u2019t a traditional tabletop game, when we don\u2019t think something is a traditional tabletop game.

"Director of a play" is a completely wrong analogy, and doesn't make any sense whatsoever. Similarly, I don't know why "simulation gaming" is involved: that has to do with acting out stressful situations to make sure you do the right things. It doesn't seem to have anything to do with telling a good story. (Also, there's a bizarre tangent about the Narrator not being an enemy, but it's totally unclear why would we think that in the first place.)<br/><br/>Stripping away all that, I think(?) I've gleaned two roles the Narrator has: to be social lubricant and keep the game moving, and to set scenes and narrate consequences. That took a pretty good amount of interpretation though, and I'm not sure how those two things work together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_387808">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387808/#Comment_387808" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-22T15:20:46+00:00" title="August 22, 2012  3:20PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "simulation gaming"= "simms", most commonly Star  Trek sims.

Maybe we tied a towel around our necks and pretended to be superheroes. Maybe we gave each of our dolls, stuffed animals or action figures a unique personality. Maybe we even explored our backyards through the eyes of Dorothy, the Scarecrow, and the Tin Woodman, imagining new corners of Oz for us to discover.<br/><br/>The Adventures in Oz roleplaying game is an evolution of those games. Each player controls a character to participate in the story. One person serves as the Narrator, who directs the story and determines the outcome of the players\u2019 actions. The Narrator will also be called on to play the parts of all of the other characters in the story, whether it\u2019s a friendly Munchkin farmer or the wicked Nome King.<br/><br/>In order to help the Narrator do that, the game has rules. Characters have Basic Skills and traits that define the character within the rules. Whenever the Narrator thinks a character\u2019s action is risky or exciting, they may call for a dice roll to determine the results...<br/><br/>A roleplaying game is not competitive, but cooperative. The object of the game is to tell an exciting Oz story starring the characters that you have created. Although the Narrator is responsible for putting challenges, obstacles and enemies in your <br/>path, you are not playing against her.<br/><br/>You can also play another session with the same characters, making new stories to add to their legend. --- <b>Adventures in Oz, 2009</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387811">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387811/#Comment_387811" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-22T15:35:26+00:00" title="August 22, 2012  3:35PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 22, 2012 11:41PM by JDCorley.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A roleplaying game is a unique kind of game. It\u2019s a lot like playing cops and robbers, except with more sophisticated rules. When players get together to play 7th Sea, they tell tales about the adventures of a group of characters in Th\xe9ah, using their collective talents to make the stories come alive for everyone involved. <br/><br/>While any number of players can participate, three to six is usually optimal, including one player \u2014 called a Game Master \u2014 who will take the role of referee and guide the stories along...<br/><br/>...The Game Master (or \u201cGM\u201d) is a very important part of the game. While each player creates a single Hero to portray, the GM creates all the people, places, and things the characters will meet. He creates plots and situations for the characters to become embroiled in and improvises plot twists when the players prove to be too clever for his initial story ideas...A GM is part author, part improvisational actor, and part referee. Whenever a dispute arises about the rules, the GM must make the final decision.<br/><br/>The best part about roleplaying games is that everyone can win. On the flipside, everyone can also lose. Roleplaying is like storytelling. When all the players work in concert, they can create a beautiful, elaborate story filled with adventure, drama, and excitement. Players have to be patient and work together, allowing each other to share the spotlight.<br/><br/>Likewise, GMs have to be fair to the players and allow everyone a chance to participate in the story. It only takes one selfish player to ruin everyone else\u2019s evening. --- <b>7th Sea Player's Guide, 1999</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_387813">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387813/#Comment_387813" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-22T15:56:28+00:00" title="August 22, 2012  3:56PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The best part about roleplaying games is that everyone can win.

The goal of Mortal Coil is the creation of a shared world of the supernatural, and a strong style of narrative, novel-like play. A role-playing game is one in which you create a story together with your friends, and the rules of Mortal Coil are designed to help you do this. While playing Mortal Coil, most of the players will take on the role of one character, while one of the players, the Game Moderator or GM, will present challenges to these characters and portray the supporting cast in the story. The larger group of players will represent the protagonists of the story and will work with the GM to create the conflict and action...<br/><br/>Mortal Coil is a game, and therefore has players. Everyone sitting around the table during a game of Mortal Coil will be a player. Most of the players will have a single character they created, and their task is to portray this character during the game. One player has a special role, the Game Moderator or GM. His duties are described in a bit more detail below.<br/><br/>Just because a player has created her character and has the task of portraying this character at the table does not mean that she has complete control of the character. Other players are allowed to influence the character during play, and may use conflicts to make another character feel or act a certain way. Also, players wishing to add details to the game relating to their own character will also have to gain the consent of the group (see Threshold of Credibility, below)...<br/><br/>The Game Moderator, referred to hereafter as the GM, is a player with a special role. Since each of the other players portrays a single character, there is a lot of open area that is not covered. The GM takes on the role of the world at large, including any supporting characters not portrayed by another player. The GM has a big task, but since the story told in a game of Mortal Coil is about the players\u2019 characters, it is not as overwhelming as it might initially sound.<br/><br/>The GM plays an important part in the group\u2019s overall story or situation. The GM\u2019s job is to make sure that the world presents challenges and difficulties for the players\u2019 characters. Good story emerges from conflict, and things that are easy are often boring. The GM will ensure that the players\u2019 characters struggle to win their achievements by providing adversity, in the form of villains, rivals, and difficult situations.<br/><br/>The GM will also take the role of rules arbiter when a conflict arises in the fictional world of the game and the rules are used to determine the outcome. The GM will often present challenges from supporting characters in these situations, but must also be mindful of her role as a judge during these scenes. GMs should be impartial and adjudicate the conflicts with an eye not only toward logic, but also toward drama. --- <b>Mortal Coil, 2006</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_387823">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387823/#Comment_387823" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-22T18:14:56+00:00" title="August 22, 2012  6:14PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 22, 2012 11:42PM by JDCorley.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Telling stories is a tradition we\u2019ve shared since the earliest men learned to talk. Everyone gathers around and the storyteller avails the listener with tales of adventures, mystery, action or terror. <br/><br/>Role playing games (RPGs) were born of this tradition. But instead of a single storyteller telling the story and playing the part of all the characters, role playing games spread the work around a bit. <br/><br/>To play a role playing game you need at least two people, though three or four is preferable. One person usually has some sort of title, we call him the Game Master (or \u201cGM\u201d) and the other participants are simply called Players. <br/><br/>Each player makes up a character. Like a character in a book or movie, the character should have an interesting background, quirky habits, views and beliefs and other traits that makes the character well-rounded. <br/><br/>But unlike a book or movie, the character is assigned statistics and traits that are defined by the game system. These attributes tell the player, and others, how capable the character is at performing certain things. <br/><br/>It is the GM\u2019s job to come up with some sort of plot outline for the story as well as playing all the other characters that appear. He is also the final arbitrator of the rules, and may even supersede the rules of the game if it suits his story. <br/><br/>So when the game starts, the GM describes to the players where their characters are and what is going on around them. And then he\u2019ll ask \u201cWhat are you going to do.\u201d <br/><br/>Each player will, in turn, describe what actions they wish to take. Using the rules of the game, the players and GM determine what happens when the players attempt their actions and whether or not they succeed. <br/><br/>And that\u2019s role playing! --- <b>Strands of Fate, 2010</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387826/#Comment_387826" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-22T18:40:13+00:00" title="August 22, 2012  6:40PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 22, 2012 11:42PM by JDCorley.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ars Magica is meant to be played by a group numbering anywhere from three to ten or more.

The person who is leading the story at any given time is called the "storyguide". Usually the storyguide has created a long-term plot against which individual adventures are set. The overarching storyline is called the "saga" and the shorter adventures within it are "stories". --- <b>Ars Magica 4th Edition, 2003</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_387827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387827/#Comment_387827" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-22T18:40:46+00:00" title="August 22, 2012  6:40PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 22, 2012 8:31PM by JDCorley.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (The almost complete lack of instructions on how to play Ars Magica is, in hindsight, absolutely staggering, for a game with such a complex premise and execution.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387831/#Comment_387831" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-22T20:39:50+00:00" title="August 22, 2012  8:39PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 22, 2012 9:01PM by Johnstone.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dungeons &amp; Dragons is a fantastic, exciting and imaginative game of role playing for adults 12 years and up. Each player creates a character or characters who may be dwarves, elves, halflings or human fighting men, magic-users, pious clerics or wily thieves. The characters are then plunged into an adventure in a series of dungeons, tunnels, secret rooms and caverns run by another player: the referee, often called the Dungeon Master. The dungeons are filled with fearsome monsters, fabulous treasure and frightful perils. As the players engage in game after game their characters grow in power and ability: the magic users learn more magic spells, the thieves increase in cunning and ability, the fighting men, halflings, elves and dwarves, fight with more deadly accuracy and are harder to kill. Soon the adventurers are daring to go deeper and deeper into the dungeons on each game, battling more terrible monsters, and, of course, recovering bigger and more fabulous treasure! The game is limited only by the inventiveness and imagination of the players, and, if a group is playing together, the characters can move from dungeon to dungeon within the same magical universe if game referees are approximately the same in their handling of play.<br/><br/>The Dungeon Master designs the dungeons and makes careful maps on graph paper. The players do not know where anything is located in the dungeons until the game begins and they enter the first passage or room. They create their own map as they explore. While only paper and pencil need be used, it is possible for the characters of each player to be represented by miniature lead figures which can be purchased inexpensively from hobby stores or directly from TSR Hobbies. The results of combat, magic spells, monster attacks, etc., are resolved by rolling special polyhedral 20-sided dice which come with this game.<br/><b>--- Dungeons &amp; Dragons (1977), edited by Eric Holmes.</b><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_387832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387832/#Comment_387832" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-22T20:47:34+00:00" title="August 22, 2012  8:47PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 22, 2012 11:42PM by JDCorley.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            D&amp;D4e has a HUGE introductory section - about four full pages in big text, with lots of cool illustrations. It honestly is one of the best I've ever seen.  Here's the first section:\n<blockquote>A roleplaying game is a storytelling game that has elements of the games of make-believe that many of us played as children. However, a roleplaying game such as D&amp;D provides form and structure, with robust gameplay and endless possibilities.<br/><br/>D&amp;D is a fantasy-adventure game. You create a character, team up with other characters (your friends), explore a world and batrtle monsters. While the D&amp;D game uses dice and miniatures, the action takes place in your imagination. There, you have the freedom to create anything you can imagine, with an unlimited special effects budget and the technology to make anything happen.<br/><br/>What makes the D&amp;D game unique is the Dungeon Master. The DM is a person who takes on the role of lead storyteller and game referee. The DM creates adventures for the characters and narrates the action for the players. The DM makes D&amp;D infinitely flexible - he or she can react to any situation, any twist or turn suggested by the players, to make a D&amp;D adventure vibrant, exciting and unexpected. <br/><br/>The adventure is the heart of the D&amp;D game. It's like a fantasy movie or novel, except the characters that you and your friends create are the stars of the story. --- <b>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Players Handbook, 2008</b></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387833">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387833/#Comment_387833" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-22T20:48:58+00:00" title="August 22, 2012  8:48PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 22, 2012 11:42PM by JDCorley.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game is a tabletop fantasy game in which the players take on the roles of heroes who form a group (or party) to set out on dangerous adventures.

This doesn't even fit into a single post:<br/><br/>Swords &amp; sorcery best describes what this game is all about, for those are the two key fantasy ingredients. ADVANCED DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS is a fantasy game of role playing which relies upon the imagination of participants, for it is certainly make-believe, yet it is so interesting, so challenging, so mind-unleashing that it comes near reality.<br/><br/>As a role player, you become Falstaff the fighter. You know how strong, intelligent, wise, healthy, dexterous and, relatively speaking, how commanding a personality you have. Details as to your appearance your body proportions, and your history can be produced by you or the Dungeon Master. You act out the game as this character, staying within your "godgiven abilities", and as molded by your philosophical and moral ethics (called alignment). You interact with your fellow role players, not as Jim and Bob and Mary who work at the office together, but as Folstaff the fighter, Agore the cleric, and Filmar, the mistress of magic! The Dungeon Master will act the parts of "everyone else", and will present to you a variety of new characters to talk with, drink with, gamble with,  adventure with, and often fight with! Each of you will become an ortful thespian as time goes by - and you will acquire gold, magic items, and great renown as you become Falstaff the Invincible!<br/><br/>This game lets all of your fantasies come true. This is a world where monsters, dragons, good and evil high priests, fierce demons, and even the gods themselves may enter your character's life. Enjoy, for this game is what dreams are made of!!<br/><br/>The game is ideally for three or more adult players: one player must serve as the Dungeon Master, the shaper of the fantasy milieu, the "world" in which all action will take place. The other participants become adventurers by creating characters to explore the fantastic world and face all of its challenges - monsters, magic, and unnamed menaces. As is typical for most of us in real life, each character begins at the bottom of his or her chosen class (or profession). By successfully meeting the challenges posed, they gain experience and move upwards in power, just as actual playing experience really increases playing skill. Imagination, intelligence, problem solving ability, ond memory are all continually exercised by participants in the game.<br/><br/>Although the masculine form of appellation is typically used when listing the level titles of the various types of characters, these names can easily be changed to the feminine if desired. This is fantasy - what's in a name? In all but a few cases sex makes no difference to ability!<br/><br/>As with most other role playing games, this one is not just a single experience contest. It is an ongoing campaign, with each playing session related to the next by results and participant characters who go from episode to episode. As players build the experience level of their characters and go forth seeking ever greater challenges, they must face stronger monsters and more difficult problems of other sorts (and here the Dungeon Master must likewise increase his or her ability and inventiveness). While initial adventuring usually takes place in an underworld dungeon setting, play gradually expands to encompass other such dungeons, town and city activities, wilderness explorations, and journeys into other dimensions, planes, times, worlds, and so forth. Players will add characters to their initial adventurer as the milieu expands so that each might actually have several characters, each involved in some separate and distinct adventure form, busily engaged in the game at the same moment of "Game Time". This allows participation by many players in games which are substantially different from game to game as dungeon, metropolitan, and outdoor settings are rotated from playing to playing. And perhaps a war between players will be going on (with battles actually fought out on the tabletop with minature figures) one night, while on the next, characters of these two contending players are helping each other to survive somewhere in a wilderness.<br/><br/>Each individual campaign has its awn distinct properties and "flavor". A good Dungeon Master will most certainly make each game a surpassing challenge for his or her players. Treasure and experience gained must be taken at great risk or by means of utmost cleverness only. If the game is not challenging, if advancement is too speedy, then it becomes staid and boring. Conversely, a game can be too deadly and become just as boring, for who enjoys endlessly developing new characters to march off into oblivion in a single night of dungeon adventuring?!<br/><br/>Sometimes, however, because of close interaction (or whatever other reason) two or more Dungeon Masters will find that their games are compatible to the extent that participants in these individual campaigns can use the characters created in one to adventure in the others. In such cases the Dungeon Masters have created a very interesting "world" indeed, for their milieux will offer interesting differences and subtle shifts which will pose highly challenging problems to these players.<br/><br/>...to be continued...<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387835">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387835/#Comment_387835" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-22T20:57:21+00:00" title="August 22, 2012  8:57PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 22, 2012 9:02PM by Johnstone.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...continued from previous post...<br/><br/>Ultimately, despite the fact that this is a game system created by someone else, the game's viability rests principally with the referee. The Dungeon Master must design and map out the dungeon, town, city, and world maps. He or she must populate the whole world, create its past history, and even devise some rationale for what transpired (and will probably happen). As players, you help immeasurably by participating, by letting the referee know that you appreciate his or her efforts, and by playing well and in a sportsmanly fashion. Good play inspires better creations to challenge that play.<br/><br/>Skilled players always make a point of knowing what they are doing, i.e. they have an objective. They co-operate - particularly at lower levels or at higher ones when they must face some particularly stiff challenge \u2013 in order to gain their ends. Superior players will not fight everything they meet, for they realize that wit is as good a weapon as the sword or the spell. When weakened by wounds, or nearly out of spells and vital equipment, a clever party will seek to leave the dungeons in order to rearm themselves. (He who runs away lives to fight another day.) When faced with a difficult situation, skilled players will not attempt endless variations on the same theme; when they find the method of problem<br/>solving fails to work, they begin to devise other possible solutions. Finally, good players will refrain from pointless argument and needless harassment of the Dungeon Master when such bog the play of the game down into useless talking. Mistakes are possible, but they are better righted through reason and logic, usually at the finish of play for the day.<br/><br/>This game is unlike chess in that the rules are not cut and dried. In many places they are guidelines and suggested methods only. This is part of the attraction of ADVANCED DUNGEONS 8 DRAGONS, and it is integral to the game. Rules not understood should have appropriate questions directed to the publisher; disputes with the Dungeon Master are another matter entirely. THE REFEREE IS THE FINAL ARBITER OF ALL AFFAIRS OF HIS OR HER CAMPAIGN. Participants in a campaign have no recourse to the publisher, but they do have ultimate recourse - since the most effective protest is withdrawal from the offending campaign. Each campaign is a specially tailored affair. While it is drawn by the referee upon the outlines of the three books which comprise ADVANCED DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS, the players add the color and details, so the campaign must ultimately please all participants. It is their unique world. You, the reader, as a member of the campaign community, do not belong if the game seems wrong in any<br/>major aspect. Withdraw and begin your own campaign by creating a milieu which suits you and the group which you must form to enjoy the creation. (And perhaps you will find that preparation of your own milieu creates a bit more sympathy for the efforts of the offending referee. . . )<br/><br/>One of the most important items you must have to play the game is a character record. This can be a specially printed sheet done by TSR and available in pads, or you can simply use a note pad and design your own record sheet for your character if your Dungeon Master is agreeable, far he or she will usually retain at least a copy of all such records.<br/><br/>As information is developed for your character- his or her abilities, race, class, alignment - it must be accurately recorded. All details of the capabilities and possessions of the character must be noted. Where equipment and weapons are carried must be listed. Spells known and spells memorized for an adventure have to be kept track of. A running total of experience points must be maintained. All of these subjects are discussed herein. Ask your DM how records of your character should be kept, read the rules and commentary, and record the data you develop according to the rules (and your campaign referee's instructions) in a form suitable to your DM.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a game for enjoyment. We are certain that it will provide endless hours of entertainment and excitement. That is the sole purpose for its creation. So enjoy, and may the dice be good to you!<br/><br/><b>--- Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons Player's Handbook (1978), by Gary Gygax.</b><br/><br/>(this isn't even the majority of the introduction, either)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_387847">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387847/#Comment_387847" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-22T23:46:27+00:00" title="August 22, 2012 11:46PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Storytelling games are about doing just what you'd think - telling stories.

The story unfolds like a movie, except all the action takes place in your imagination.<br/><br/>There's no script to follow, other than a rough outline used by the Gamemaster (GM); you decide what your character says and does. The Gamemaster, as the director and special effects designer, decides what the story is about and takes on the roles of all the other characters - the villains, the extras, the distinctive guest stars. The Gamemaster also keeps track of the rules, interprets the outcome of actions and describes what happens.

Now imagine several readers all making things up together at the same time and you get the idea. --- <b>Marvel Super Heroes Basic Set, 1984</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387851/#Comment_387851" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-23T00:43:53+00:00" title="August 23, 2012 12:43AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How do you talk when playing a role-playing game?<br/><br/>This is literally the sum total of concrete instructions posted so far in this thread:\n<blockquote>...A group of players sit around a table and describe the actions of their characters... - <b>Call of Cthulhu quickstart rules, 2012</b></blockquote>\n<blockquote>...the GM describes to the players where their characters are and what is going on around them.

Choose one player to be the Master of Ceremonies. Since this is the Master of Ceremonies\u2019 playbook, from now on I\u2019m going to call the MC \u201cyou.\u201d<br/>The game takes quite a few sessions to play, so choose friends with space in their schedules for a commitment. I don\u2019t figure it\u2019s much of a game until 6 sessions, and it can go much longer.<br/>Print and assemble a batch of character playbooks, one of each. Pass them around. Have everybody choose one, no duplicates allowed.<br/>Print your pullouts too: a 1st session worksheet, an MC playsheet. Maybe print a fronts sheet too, although you won\u2019t need it yet. Fronts are your prep for play, starting after the first session. (Tink \u201cI\u2019m fighting on three fronts! I\u2019m fucked!\u201d)<br/>You\u2019ll also need notepaper, pencils, and some 6-sided dice, at least two of them.<br/><br/>- The Conversation<br/>You probably know this already: roleplaying is a conversation. You and the other players go back and forth, talking about these fictional characters in their fictional circumstances doing whatever it is that they do. Like any conversation, you take turns, but it\u2019s not like taking turns, right? Sometimes you talk over each other, interrupt, build on each others\u2019 ideas, monopolize. All fine.<br/>All these rules do is mediate the conversation. They kick in when someone says some particular things, and they impose constraints on what everyone should say after. Makes sense, right? --- <b>Apocalypse World, 2k+10</b> (sic)<br/><br/>This is what qualifies as "what is an RPG" even though it never says so explicitly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387854">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387854/#Comment_387854" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-23T02:23:07+00:00" title="August 23, 2012  2:23AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I think the problem with this discussion is that as soons as we look at some type of roleplaying games to to create an archive of what a roleplaying game is, then we already decided what a roleplaying game is and isn't.</blockquote>\nI agree with what you're saying, but I definitely think this thread, just as-is, is a worthwhile effort. Yes, JDCorley has only chosen a subset of RPGs and looked at what those RPGs say RPGs is. For some diversity, I added Apocalypse World. I've never been to a LARP, so I can't help with adding the description any LARP gives of itself or its medium, but I'd be interested if you or someone else did.<br/><br/>As long as we remember that "Games listed in this thread" is not anyone's suggestion for an exhaustive definition, I think it's interesting just to read the texts from traditional games. Especially so to inspect how including the different definitions are. Which ones allow for the possibility of a diceless game? Which ones would include LARPing? A great deal reference the pretend play of children as something RPGs stem from, but how many would include those same games in their definition?<br/><br/>In short, the restricted subset of RPGs that have had their definitions of RPGs archived in this thread doesn't bother me. If it does bother someone else, I suggest they improve on the diversity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_387855">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w176" title="w176"><img alt="w176" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/649/nZVYYAKMQQQR6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w176">w176</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387855/#Comment_387855" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-23T03:39:00+00:00" title="August 23, 2012  3:39AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Then lets look at definition for roleplaying games outside of the scope of traditional roleplaing game books.<br/><br/>Lets look at Wikipedias denintion os sexual roleplaying:\n<blockquote><i>"Sexual roleplay<br/>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br/><br/>Sexual roleplay is an erotic form of roleplay: it is a sexual behavior where two or more people act out roles in a sexual fantasy. How seriously this is taken depends on the people involved, and the scenario may be anywhere from simple and makeshift to detailed and elaborate, complete with costumes and a script. Nearly any role could become the base material for an erotic experience, and there is no limit to what objects an individual could consider sexual."</i></blockquote>\nLets change the words sexual an erotic to any other genre. Like "horror and fear".<br/><br/>What interesting to see here is that there is a lot of focus on presenting great variation in how "deeply" and how elaborate you want the roleplay to be.<br/><br/>But apart from that it really interesting to see that this description fit right in among the others.

You may already be familiar with these let's pretend games. If so, feel free to skip this section and move on to the next chapter. If you're not sure what roleplaying games are all about, read on.<br/><br/>In a roleplaying game, you pretend to be a hero, pirate, space pilot or whatever...just like when you were a kid. The difference is that you have rules. Roleplaying games can be simple (and they don't get any simpler than TOON) or they can fill several volumes. It doesn't matter. Roleplaying is just "let's pretend".<br/><br/>You need at least two people to play Toon. Three or four people make up an ideal group. One person, the Animator, runs the game. The Animator tells the players what sort of cartoon world they're in, who (or what) lives there, and what happens. The Animator picks the adventure from the Short Subjects and Feature Film in the back of the book. Experienced Animators can write their own adventures!<br/><br/>Each of the other players pretends to be a single cartoon character in the Animator's adventure. Here's where the roleplaying comes in. As the Animator describes the setting and events of the adventure, each player reacts, describing what his or her character does. The Animator determines what happens because of the players' actions. The players respond...and so on until the end of the cartoon.<br/><br/>And that's all there is to that!<br/><br/><b>Toon, 1984</b><br/><br/>Note to self and others: <i>Tunnels and Trolls</i> has a really interesting, and long, introductory section.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_387857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w176" title="w176"><img alt="w176" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/649/nZVYYAKMQQQR6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w176">w176</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387857/#Comment_387857" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-23T03:46:43+00:00" title="August 23, 2012  3:46AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From Lajvnorr by Henrik Thurfj\xe4ll (translated from Swedish):\n<blockquote>"LARP is a form of storytelling, just like a movie, a book, etc., the difference is that during a LARP you a participant in the story and may thus influence the plot, but also experience the story with more senses "</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387858">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387858/#Comment_387858" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-23T04:02:32+00:00" title="August 23, 2012  4:02AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Corley's not looking for definitions of role-playing or role-playing games.

There are many different ways to play an RPG but the basic concept is that the player guides an imaginary person referred to as a character though an adventure or series of adventures. The common term for a player\u2019s character is a Player Character and this convention is used in this game. In the Player Character\u2019s adventures, there will be things the player wants their character to do but it is not clear that the character can easily accomplish them. Con\ufb02icts between characters is one situation where the outcome is not clear. Steampunk\ufb01tters is a diceless game meaning it uses no randomizer to resolve con\ufb02icts. The con\ufb02icts are resolved by strategy and surprise. <br/><br/>RPGs can be very \ufb02exible games, meaning they can be made to do a lot of different things with the same rules. Steampunk\ufb01tters is designed to create unique stories of science and adventure in a steampunk atmosphere. The story is almost always different and no one player controls everything. The rules explain how to test if the players can do the things they want, the fact that they cannot assume they will be successful every time ads tension and intrigue to the unfolding story. <br/><br/>Story is very important to an RPG. The rules do not make the story, it is created by the setting and the players. There is one very <br/>important job for one player to handle. While the rest of the players have their Player Characters to guide, this one player guides the rest of the story. This player is called the game master (or GM). One of the important jobs the game master has is to decide what the player characters have to do to win each game. <br/><br/>How Do You Win? <br/>In most games there is a set of circumstances that the players have to achieve to win the game but it can change greatly for game to game. In one game the winning conditions may be achieving a goal like getting a dif\ufb01cult to \ufb01nd part that is needed for an invention. Sometimes the goal may be to simply stay alive in a dangerous place. In some games it may be to just have fun.<br/><br/>My <b>Steampunkfitters 2011</b><br/><br/>I worked hard on this description to not say that an RPG is "like" something else or that it "is not" another thing. Some of the text is specific to this game and that was intentional but when it speaks generally, I think it does a reasonably good job of encompassing the process.

And even if they do, this thread will still exist, and it would take a lot for Andy to delete any of the posts in it.</blockquote>\nExactly, this ain't one of those forums where I will come in and go "TUT TUT" if you post something that I'm not interested in.  If there's a sexual roleplaying game text and it has a "what is a roleplaying game" section, go for it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387897">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387897/#Comment_387897" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-23T09:51:30+00:00" title="August 23, 2012  9:51AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Elements of Stylish Horror<br/><br/>This  book  presents  rules  for  playing  a  type  of roleplaying game called Storytelling. In this type of game, the traditional elements of a story \u2014 theme, mood, plot and character \u2014 are more important than the rules themselves. The rules serve to help you tell stories about your characters in an interactive experience. They help prevent arguments and provide a solid basis for handling elements of chance, but they don\u2019t overshadow the story itself. The triumphs and tragedies of your characters as they try to survive and even thrive in the World of Darkness are the main focus, not dice rolls or lists of traits.<br/><br/>Storytelling games involve at least two, although preferably four or more players. Everybody involved in the game participates in telling a group story \u2014 the players<br/>create and act out the roles of their characters, and the Storyteller creates and reveals the plot, introducing allies and antagonists with which the players\u2019 characters interact.  The  players\u2019  choices  throughout  the  course  of  the Storytelling experience alter the plot. The Storyteller\u2019s job isn\u2019t to defend his story from any attempt to change it, but to help create the story as events unfold, reacting to the players\u2019 choices and weaving them into a greater whole, introducing secondary characters and exotic settings. --- <b>The World Of Darkness Storytelling System Rulebook, 2004</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_387906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387906/#Comment_387906" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-23T11:06:36+00:00" title="August 23, 2012 11:06AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Love this!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387907/#Comment_387907" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-23T11:21:58+00:00" title="August 23, 2012 11:21AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Love this!</blockquote>\nYes.

The gamemaster manages the action of the story and controls the opposition (often in the form of non-player characters\u2014NPCs for short), as well as providing the props, the setting, and any other situations or obstacles the players\u2019 characters may encounter. Together with the gamemaster, the players create an intense and interesting adventure for their characters to resolve (if they can).</p>\n<p>The player characters (PCs) in A Time of War are operatives or warriors from one of the many factions who constantly struggle for dominance in the BattleTech universe. The statistics and information needed to run these characters effectively are noted on each character\u2019s Character Record Sheet.</p>\n<p>During the course of the game, the GM will describe the events and surroundings to the other players, while those players will attempt to navigate their characters through the adventure. Periodically, the GM may require a dice roll to resolve a character\u2019s actions, using the rules to determine the success (or failure) of the attempted action based on the dice roll result, the character\u2019s statistics, and any relevant circumstances.</p>\n<p><strong>Battletech: A Time of War (Quick Start Rules) (2010)</strong></p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_387912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387912/#Comment_387912" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-23T11:48:45+00:00" title="August 23, 2012 11:48AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 23, 2012 11:49AM by Wordman.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A roleplaying game is part improvisational theater, part storytelling and part board game. It is played by a gamemaster who runs the game and a group of players who pretend to be characters. These characters are defined by a set of statistics that represent skills and attributes developed in the character creation process. These are then fleshed out with an invented background and personality. The gamemaster presents the setting and situation; through their characters, the players interact with the storyline and other characters. <br/><br/>Think of it this way: everyone has read a book or seen a movie in which the lead character does something that the reader or viewer finds so utterly wrong that he or she wants to shout out a warning. But no matter what we say, the character will do what the plot demands; we\u2019re just along for the ride. Even throwing popcorn won\u2019t help.<br/><br/>In a roleplaying game, the players control their characters\u2019 actions and respond to the events of the plot. If the player does not want his or her character to go through the door, the character will not. If the player thinks the character can talk him- or herself out of a tight situation rather than resorting to that trusty pistol, he or she can talk away. The script, or plot, of a roleplaying game is flexible, always changing based on the decisions the players make as characters.<br/><br/>The gamemaster controls the story. He or she keeps track of what is supposed to happen when, describes events as they occur so that the players (as characters) can react to them, keeps track of other characters in the game (referred to as nonplayer characters), and resolves attempts to take action using the game system. The game system comes into play when characters seek to use their skills or otherwise do something that requires a test to see whether or not they succeed. Specific rules are presented for situations that involve rolling dice to determine the outcome (see Game Concepts, p. 38).<br/><br/>The gamemaster describes the world as the characters see it, functioning as their eyes, ears and other senses. Gamemastering is not easy, but the thrill of creating an adventure that engages the other players\u2019 imaginations, testing their gaming skills and their characters\u2019 skills in the game world, makes it worthwhile. FanPro publishes game supplements and adventures to help this process along, but good gamemasters always adapt the game universe to suit their own styles.<br/><br/>In roleplaying, stories (the adventures) evolve much like a movie or book, but within the flexible storyline created by the gamemaster. The story is the overall plot, a general outline for what might happen at certain times or in reaction to other events. It is no more concrete than that until the players become involved. At that point, the adventure becomes as involving and dramatic as that great movie you saw last week, or that great book you stayed up all night to finish. In some ways it\u2019s even better, because you helped create it.<br/><br/>- <b><i>Shadowrun</i>, Third Edition (2005)</b><br/><br/>First and Second Edition had no such section at all.

Rather than playing soldier or house and running around in your backyard or the alley behind your apartment, you and your friends sit around a comfortable room and describe the heroic feats your characters accomplish. To help make sure you all share the same vision of what\u2019s going on, there\u2019s a mediator and narrator (the \u201cStoryteller\u201d), who describes events and keeps the story moving along. In order to prevent arguments of who did what first and if an action is possible, there are rules that describe what your character can and can\u2019t do. In order to prevent bitterness over someone beating someone else in a fight, the characters are usually allies against imaginary opposition that the Storyteller tries to portray as even-handedly as possible. In order to prevent jaded adult imaginations from being bored quickly, the setting is much more intricate and complex than most people\u2019s childhood fantasies.<br/><br/>But just because Exalted is like something children do doesn\u2019t make it any less serious. Kids build little forts and treehouses, while adults build skyscrapers. If you want, your storytelling can be as serious as improvisational acting. It doesn\u2019t have to be terribly serious, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with taking it seriously.<br/><br/>To play Exalted, you\u2019ll need between three and six people. One person assumes the role of the Storyteller. It\u2019s her job to describe how things unfold, play the bit characters and the supporting cast and moderate any disputes over the rules. Everyone else makes up a \u201ccharacter\u201d (the game term for the imaginary person you portray) and thrills vicariously to the heroic deeds of their alter egos. The reason the game is best with four to six people participating is that there tend to be a lot of awkward silences with less than three players, while a game with more than five players can be very hard for the Storyteller to manage.<br/><br/>Exalted is a continuing game \u2014 the basic assumption in this book is that you\u2019ll play your character more than once. Most people who play Storytelling games meet between once a week and once every two weeks and play for between four and eight hours a session. Most people seem to enjoy playing the same character for between six and eighteen months.<br/><br/>- <b><i>Exalted</i>, First Edition (2001)</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387916">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387916/#Comment_387916" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-23T12:00:27+00:00" title="August 23, 2012 12:00PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Storytelling<br/><br/>At its heart, storytelling is make-believe with rules. Rather than playing House or Cops and Robbers in your backyard, you and a group of friends describe and bring to life the heroic exploits of your characters. To make sure every player shares the same vision, one takes the role of narrator of events and mediator of disputes (the Storyteller), who is in charge of describing events and keeping the story moving forward. In order to prevent argument over who did what first and how successfully, certain rules outline what a character can and can\u2019t do. Typically, the players\u2019 characters are allies against the imagined opposition portrayed by the Storyteller.<br/><br/>Yet although storytelling is an outgrowth of games children play, that doesn\u2019t make it childish. Exalted\u2019s setting is much more intricate and engrossing than most folk\u2019s childhood fantasy worlds, and it can be taken as seriously as its players want. If they want to treat it like improvisational theatre, great.<br/><br/>In order to play Exalted, you\u2019ll need a group of three to six people. One of you will take on the role of Storyteller while the others generate characters. It\u2019s the Storyteller\u2019s job to bring the game world to life for her players. She describes the environment and how events unfold, she portrays all the characters of the Exalted world with whom the players\u2019 characters come into contact, and she moderates any rule disputes. The players thrill to the heroic derring-do of their characters on the stage provided by the Storyteller.<br/><br/>Exalted is typically played as an ongoing game. There are no winners and losers, just players. Such games are most enjoyable if the players meet every week or two to play as it keeps things fresh in everyone\u2019s minds and gives everyone a genuine sense of their characters\u2019 development over time. Although an Exalted series can be open-ended and continue indefinitely, most Storytellers construct series with an end in mind, as both Storyteller and players often want to try their hand at new characters and genres of play.<br/><br/>- <b><i>Exalted</i>, Second Edition (2008)</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_387918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387918/#Comment_387918" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-23T12:07:09+00:00" title="August 23, 2012 12:07PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I should mention that, though it is way too long to quote here, the "how to run this game" chapters of <i>Gamma World, Sixth Edition, Gamemaster's Guide</i> might be the best "what is a role-playing game?" text in history.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387919/#Comment_387919" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-23T12:09:36+00:00" title="August 23, 2012 12:09PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            HOW TO USE THIS BOOK<br/><br/>GAMMA WORLD is a role-playing campaign game. One (or more) of the participants acts as referee, creating a world in which the players act out parts as in a book or play, parts scripted by the referee but formed and finalized by all participants. The referee presents the situations in which the players are to adventure. In each adventure, the players gain experience, and hopefully, valuable artifacts, which increase their chances of survival (they are occasionally killed) in GAMMA WORLD. An interconnected series of such adventures is called a campaign.<br/><br/>Potential players and referees with previous experience in role-playing games will find that the mechanics of GAMMA WORLD are similar to most conventional role-playing games. Much of the material, however, is for the benefit of players seeking their first experience in a role-playing game. The rules are rather lengthy, but actually quite simple. They provide a nearly endless multi-level, science fantasy game that, once begun, need never end.<br/><br/>The referee is the participant who is willing to provide the mental and physical labor of completing the game within the framework provided. He will also preside over the actual play of the game itself. Instructions detailing the referee\u2019s tasks are given in the material to follow. However, three attributes necessary for a good referee imagination, creativity, and a sense of fair play - must be provided by the referee himself. He must carefully balance risk with reward. The game he creates must not be so \u201cdeadly\u201d as to make survival of the player-characters impossible. On the other hand, he must see to it that the player characters are challenged. Too many rewards given at too little risk is sure to create a boring game.<br/><br/>Since \u201cnew\u201d characters are, by game mechanics, relatively weak and inexperienced, the referee should plan to present smaller risks and correspondingly small rewards at the beginning of the campaign, and increase the risks and rewards as the player characters become more powerful and experienced.<br/><br/>The players cannot begin the game until the referee has completed his design work. Once the referee has made the necessary preparations, the players create their game personae, called player characters, as described under CREATING CHARACTERS. After a character has been established, the player is responsible for keeping records of his character\u2019s attributes and possessions, as well as notes and maps concerning areas which his character has explored.<br/><br/>- <b><i>Gamma World</i>, First Edition (1978)</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_387920">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387920/#Comment_387920" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-23T12:11:15+00:00" title="August 23, 2012 12:11PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            HOW TO PLAY<br/><br/>This game is a role-playing game, an extended form of "make-believe." In a typical game, 2 to 8 players are seated around a large table. They may have a map showing part of a ruined city spread out before them. Perhaps, they are acting out the adventures of a band of explorers. One player might be a mutated human with some awesome special power (telepathy, for example). Two others might be unmutated humans. They may be accompanied by a fourth player who is a highly intelligent mutant bear. Together, they make a formidable team as they search the ruins for a precious artifact said to be in the city. As they enter dark sewers and crumbling buildings, they face such futuristic horrors as the Badder (an evil species of mutant badger), the Cal Then (an intelligent flying insect) and the Kep (a man-eating plant).<br/><br/>The people these players are pretending to be are called Player Characters (abbreviated as PC's). In some cases, players might play more than one character in an adventure. From time to time these Player Characters will meet other people or intelligent animals (or even plants) who aren't being "played" by any player. These other characters are called Non-Player Characters (NPC's). In addition to the Player Characters in the game, one player takes on the special role of the Game Master (GM). The Game Master does not play a character. Instead, he acts as a referee, helps keep the action moving and plays the parts of all the NPC's the Player Characters meet. When a connected series of adventures (called a Campaign) is being played, the GM establishes the setting for those adventures the same way an author sets up a background for the action in a novel. The GM's duties are explained in more detail later in these rules.<br/><br/>HOW TO WIN<br/><br/>There are no "winners" or "losers" in a GAMMA WORLD\xae game. The object of the game is just to have fun. The Player Characters are, of course, interested in surviving and (in a Campaign) gaining status. But a player whose character is seriously hurt or killed doesn't "lose." He simply creates a new character and keeps playing!<br/><br/>- <b><i>Gamma World</i>, Second Edition (1983)</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387922">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WPTunes" title="WPTunes"><img alt="WPTunes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/193/nI9P6PIU22T8F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WPTunes">WPTunes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387922/#Comment_387922" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-23T12:11:52+00:00" title="August 23, 2012 12:11PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Welcome to the world of roleplaying. Or, as it's called over here, the world of an authentic <strong>Victorian Adventure Entertainment</strong>. In the pages to follow, I'm going to show you how you can become an adventurer in the world of <em>Castle Falkenstein</em>, how to fight Evil Unseelie Lords, meet Dragons, thwart Masterminds and all the other things <em>I</em> get to do for real on a daily basis. But unlike <em>me</em>, you won't be in danger of getting decapitated by a saber or eaten alive by a Troll.</p>\n<p>Instead, you'll adventure from the safety of your own drawing room, much like many New Europans who now play Adventure Entertainments as a regular pastime. You'll do this through the power of imagination, your ability to project yourself into the role of another person in another place and time - a <strong>Dramatic Character</strong> as it's called here - a fictional personal you will adopt and roleplay through each new situation that Character encounters. It's the ultimate form of Method Acting, if you will, and once you know the tricks, you can do it anywhere: in your automotive as it chuffs down the road, on the train to Paris, or even in the comfortable passenger lounge of your aeroship as it speeds high over the Alps.</p>\n<p>One of you will become the <strong>Host</strong>, a player in the Great Game who has all the good parts: judge, jury and creator of the fantasy world everyone else will share. As Host, it will be your job to pose the Situation that all the Players will become involved in, whether it's a desperate mission to restore a Lost King to a throne like I did, or to battle the forces of the marauding Fredonian Air Pirates as they swoop down upon a helpless city you have all sworn to defend. The scope of your adventures in New Europa will have no limit except those of your own mind - and the few rules I'll outline in these pages to help keep things consistent and authentically Steam Age.</p>\n<p>As Host, you have a lot of tools at your disposal; you'll get to create all of the characters the other Players don't (including the parts of the Bad Guys), using them to shape and create the Adventures you conceive. You'll also have this world as a tool. The stories, pictures and descriptions I have brought together in these Notebooks for you to enjoy, besides being a record of my own adventures, they are a good source of information on just how the world of <em>Castle Falkenstein</em> works. They are also a pretty fair example of how Diaries and Journals work as well. Lastly, you'll have these rules I have cobbled together from the many Adventure Entertainments I have personally "hosted" for my Steam Age friends at parties and gatherings all over New Europa, a background of experience that I give you to use in your own Adventures.</p>\n<p>The rest of you will become <strong>Players</strong> in the Great Game: the actors of a joint story that everyone will have a hand in writing. As a Player, you'll use your wits, powers of visualization, and acting skills to make your hour upon the Grand Stage a memorable one. You'll also use a <strong>Diary</strong> or Journal - a special book in which you'll record the hopes, dreams, plans and schemes of your Dramatic Character as he adventures in the Steam Age. The Diary will be your way of becoming part of the creative process that makes up a good Adventure, and may even provide hours of entertainment if you choose to read them aloud to each other.</p>\n<p>So gather your band of stout comrades together and prepare to take up saber and revolver in the name of Adventure.

A game of imagination and make-believe. Where each player decides the actions of individual characters as if acting in a play or movie.<br/><br/>A role-playing game requires one player to play the role of the Game Master (GM for short), the creator and teller of the story and the arbitrator of the game\u2019s events. The GM creates the goals and obstacles of an adventure and plays the part of all the creatures encountered throughout the story. It is a tough job, but one that is very rewarding, for only the GM knows what is really happening and what obstacles lie before the heroes.<br/><br/>Usually from two to five players adopt the roles of individual heroes with amazing powers and devices. Only through the players\u2019 decisions and actions can he heroes defeat their foes and reach their goals. Nor are any of these roles mundane, for heroes may be true humans with command of the wonders of high technology, or mighty mutants, or intelligent animals, or powerful plants, each possessing unique powers. The rewards of success for players are many: recovering lost wonders, solving the mysteries of the story, and overcoming fearsome foes. But the greatest reward is the growth of one\u2019s character as he becomes more powerful and improves or gains abilities as a result of reaching his goals.<br/><br/>The heroes created and controlled by these players are called Player Characters, or PCs for short. The creatures played by the Game Master are called Non-Player Characters or NPCs. Rules for creating adventures and running NPCs are explained in later sections of this book. The next section shows you how create your own hero, your player character.<br/><br/>Winning?<br/><br/>The real goal of the GAMMA WORLD game is to have fun! There are no winners or losers, but all delight in a grand adventure and a story brought to a successful conclusion.<br/><br/>True, heroes may survive and grow in rank and power. But even if a character dies, a player has not lost; he has contributed to the telling of the story and he can create another hero who will try to succeed where the first one failed. The story and the adventure go on!<br/><br/>The GM succeeds if his players had fun during the adventure, regardless of whether they completed their mission. It is a GM\u2019s job to challenge players and reward their efforts, not just their accomplishments.<br/><br/>- <b><i>Gamma World</i>, Third Edition (1986)</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387926">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387926/#Comment_387926" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-23T12:19:22+00:00" title="August 23, 2012 12:19PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you're familiar with other roleplaying games, you might want to skip to the next section, because we're about to provide a qUick overview of what 0 roleplaying game is. If you're new to the hobby, get ready to enter an exciting new world.<br/><br/>Remember when you used to ploy Make Believe, when you pretended to be "Cops and Robbers" or "Cowboys and Indians"? For a few hours on a summer afternoon, you played the role of a police officer, a cowboy, or some other hero from comic books or television. You created props and settings from your imagination, and you and your friends made up stones that everyone contributed to. It was lots of fun, but it was also totally free-form-there were no rules to speak of, and sometimes disagreements cropped up that ended a game before a full story could be told.<br/><br/>Make Believe has come a long way. It has matured and developed into modern roleplaying games such as this one. In a roleplaying game, every player takes on the role of an imaginary character. These player characters are the heroes of the story. One member of the group acts as the referee, or Gamemaster. This person uses the rules of the game along with his judgment to decide the outcome of every hero's actions, usually by applying the results of dice rolls or by gauging the heroes' reactions to specific situations.<br/><br/>The Gamemaster (GM) sets up the overall plot of each story, also coiled on adventure. The GM's role includes creating the background, developing the characters who make up the supporting cast and villains, planning key events that propel the story forward, and establishing the opening scene that gets the action moving. From that point on, the Gamemaster acts much as the director of a movie or the narrator in a novel, showing the heroes the world around them and describing the action as it unfolds.<br/><br/>The Gamemaster is the person in charge of the game. He gets it started and keeps it gOing. When a simple game of Make Believe comes to a halt, It's usually because the players couldn't agree on what Just happened or what was going to happen next. That disagreement doesn't occur In a roleplaying game, because the Gamemaster has the final soy in any situation that isn't covered by the rules.<br/><br/>However, the Gamemaster doesn't dictate everything that happens. Unlike the characters in a novel or a movie, the players' heroes don't just do what an author decides they will do. The players take on active role, describing how their heroes react to the events going on around them.<br/><br/>When players, characters, plots, rules, and imaginations get together, the resulting swirl of interaction and participation is called roleplaying. Through roleplaying, the group tells a story that's started by the Gamemaster and expanded on by the players-a group story. These group stories can be more fun and rewording than the static stories found in books and on the big screen because they're interactive. Everyone participates In their creation.<br/><br/>- <b><i>Gamma World</i>, Fifth Edition (2000)</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_387927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387927/#Comment_387927" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-23T12:19:31+00:00" title="August 23, 2012 12:19PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 23, 2012 12:20PM by Johnstone.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The book you hold contains a roleplaying game, its setting, and its rules. So what is a roleplaying game? Simply put, it is a combination of board game, strategy game, and improvisational theater. It is a more mature version of the games of \u201clet\u2019s pretend\u201d that we all played as children. The rules are meant to avoid the old disputes about exactly what happened (\u201cI shot you! You\u2019re dead!\u201d \u201cAm not!\u201d). To enforce the rules and provide a coherent setting, one of the participants assumes the role of Chronicler (known as Game<br/>Master or Referee in other contexts). The rest of the players assume the role of one character each, or a Cast Member. The player controls the actions of that character, limited only by the rules, the character\u2019s abilities and limitations, and the player\u2019s imagination.<br/><br/>Roleplaying games have been around for more than two decades. They run the gamut from mindless combat scenarios to nearly ruleless, story-driven acting exercises. The Unisystem, the game rules of the WitchCraft game, concentrates on the following elements. We consider these to be the main characteristics of a good roleplaying game.<br/><br/><b>Acting:</b> Participants in a roleplaying game are acting out the part of a Cast Member, a fictional character (or, in the case of the Chronicler, several characters). The character may be as similar or different from the player as desired. Some players prefer to take on the roles of heroic versions of themselves, while others want to \u201cbe in the shoes\u201d of completely different people. Many elements of improvisational theater can be found in roleplaying. The player has to come up with the \u201clines\u201d of her character as the storyline develops.<br/><br/><b>Storytelling:</b> During a game, the Chronicler and the Cast create a story, shaped by the actions of the Cast Members and the conflicts and situations provided by the Chronicler. A Story is being experienced at the same time it is being written. Because there are multiple authors of this tale, however, the creators do not know how exactly how it will end. Each character\u2019s actions impact the result, as do the conflicts and drama injected into the story by the Chronicler.<br/><br/><b>A Game of Chance:</b> The uncertainty of not knowing the end of the story is enhanced in many games by the use of dice, cards and other randomizing elements. This gives roleplaying an aspect similar to sporting events and to games of chance: what will the outcome be? This provides an excitement similar to the feeling that many experience when watching a football game or a boxing match. The skills of the participants play a big role in what the results will be, but the final outcome remains uncertain until it is over. Some gamers prefer to reduce or even eliminate randomness altogether, preferring to let the needs of the story dictate the outcome. The Unisystem is designed to please both those who like the chance element, and those who wish to minimize it, or eliminate it outright.<br/><br/><b>An Outlet to Imagination and Creativity:</b> Instead of being a passive form of entertainment, like watching television or reading a book, roleplaying exercises the players\u2019 imagination and creativity. Each shares the responsibility of producing a good and entertaining experience. Each brings humor, drama and suspense to the game. In roleplaying, the goal is not to win, but simply to have fun and help others have fun.<br/>In sum, by playing a roleplaying game, the Chronicler and the Cast Members weave a Story together. The adventures, triumphs, and tragedies of the characters will be part of a larger tapestry. In effect, the gaming group is creating and experiencing a novel or play, experiencing the double thrill of the creative act and the enjoyment of reading a book or watching a movie.<br/><b>--- C. J.

In some ways characters are like the pieces used in other games, but players in a role-playing game do not simply roll dice and move pieces around on a board. Characters can do anything a real person could do if he was living in a STAR FRONTIERS world: shoot a laser, drive a skimmer, chase dangerous interstellar criminals, explore alien worlds, or anything else the player wants the character to do. Players are not limited to only a few actions by the rules. A player has complete control over his character, and makes all the decisions for him.<br/><br/>In fact, you can think of your character as being you, placed in a science fiction world. Your character may not be like you at all - it may even be an alien, unlike anything you've ever seen before - but you make all the decisions, and act through your character. This is part of the fun of role playing; even if you are not a hero in real life, you can become one in a STAR FRONTIERS game.<br/><br/>Unlike many other games, there is no clear winner or loser in a STAR FRONTIERS game. In most games, the players will have a goal, such as capturing a group of terrorists who have kidnapped a politician or recovering a rare medicine that was lost when a spaceship crashed on an alien planet. If the players cooperate and reach their goal, everyone wins. A skillful player who uses the same character in several adventures will see that character rewarded, becoming richer, more powerful and able to handle more difficult missions.<br/><br/>- <b><i>Star Frontiers</i>, Alpha Dawn (1982)</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_387931">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387931/#Comment_387931" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-23T12:26:59+00:00" title="August 23, 2012 12:26PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            HOW TO USE THIS BOOK<br/><br/>TOP SECRET is a role playing campaign game. One {or morel of the participants acts as the referee (or Administrator) and designs exciting missions and the environments in which they will be performed {secret hideouts, a section of a City, etc. }, as well as playing the role of the head of the spy organization to which the players belong The plavers are the agents of this organization; by using dice. players randomly determine the characteristics of their agents. and then act out the role of the agent each has created. In each mission the agents gain experience (which increases the abilities of the agents), and are pard if the mission is successful (the money can be used to purchase sophisticated espionage equipment!. An interconnected series of such missions is called a campaign.<br/><br/>The main Idea, then, is for each player to create a persona for his or her character, and then to react to game situations las presented by the Administrator! according to the agent"s personality rather than the player's own. Most people in the "real world" WOUld, quite sensibly, run for cover and call the police if someone was shooting at them. In this game, however, such an occurrence is not uncommon and a player's reaction might well be to return fire upon the opponent! Readers who have participated in other role-playing games will be familiar with this concept. and the mechanics of TOP SECRET are similar to these other games. The rules provide a nearly endless multi-level game that can move in any direction the Administrator wishes: real-life Adventure, science fiction, even fantasy (once the U.N.C.L.E. agents encountered an actual vampire!).<br/><br/>The Administrator (abbreviated as "Admin") is the participant who must do the most work. He or she must provide the mental and physical labor of completing the game within the framework provided. As this game takes place almost entirely within the mind, the Admin should have a good imagination with which to "color" the adventure so that it will seem real to the players. Creativity and a sense affair play are also necessary for the Admin-risk must be carefully balanced with reward, and the situations designed must not be so deadly that no one will want to play the game!<br/><br/>Since "new" characters are, by game mechanics, relatively weak and inexperienced, the Admin should plan to present smaller risks and correspondingly small rewards at the beginning of the campaign, and increase the risks and rewards as the player characters become more powerful and experienced A good example of an environment for beginning-level characters is shown in the introductory module included with t his game.<br/><br/>The players cannot begin the game until the Admin has completed hiS or her design work. Once the referee has made the necessary preparations, the players create their game personae, called player characters, as described under CHARACTER CONSTRUCTION After a character has been established, the player is responsible for keeping records of his or her character's attributes and possessions, as well as notes and maps concerning areas which that character has explored. Much of this information can be conveniently recorded on a photocopy of the TOP SECRET AGENT'S DOSSIER, included as a perforated sheet in the rear of this book.<br/><br/>Unlike many games, the players will not necessarily be competing against one another, but often against a common enemy While the Admin must play the role of the various people the agents will encounter (guards, police, bystanders, victims, and the like), it is important that the Admin remain completely neutral, the Admin is not playing against the characters, but is in charge of running the world the characters live in. There is no defined "winner" as in most other games, but rather, anyone who survives to go on to the next mission has played successfully-everyone who participates and enjoys the game (live or die) has won the real victory! The big advantage of role-playing games over real life is that if someone makes a mistake and their character dies, the player just creates a new one and starts again.<br/><br/>The format of TOP SECRET allows for two different (but related) styles of play: running a preplanned adventure from a module like the one that is included with the game, or letting the Admin design his or her own scenario. It is a good idea to play the included adventure module before designing one's own, because in the module the reader will find good examples of how to run the game, how to design the environment, types of non-player characters to populate the environment With, and so forth.<br/><br/>After the rules become familiar, groups playing TOP SECRET may wish to have additional Admins in the campaign, There is no reason why this cannot be done, with each Admin running a separate organization with its own agents. Whether they cooperate (such as the various branches of British intelligence) or whether they compete (for example, the CIA and the KGB) would be up to the players. Guidelines for this sort of campaign expansion are detailed in the CAMPAIGN RULES.<br/><br/>- <b><i>Top Secret</i> (1980)</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387932">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387932/#Comment_387932" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-23T12:28:31+00:00" title="August 23, 2012 12:28PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The moment - to - moment play of The Mountain Witch is much like other role-playing games.

One player provides the narrative and some of the dialogue, but the other players, instead of just sitting and envisioning what's going on, actually participate. Each player controls the actions of a character in the story, decides on his actions, supplies his character's dialogue, and makes decisions based on the character's personality and his current game options.<br/><br/>The DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS game is a fantasy role-playing game. This means that it's set in a world where men and women can wield powerful magic, where monsters like dragons thrive, and where heroes like Sinbad, Hercules, and Lancelot abound.<br/><br/>When you play the D&amp;D game, one player will become the Dungeon Master (also known as the DM or referee). He or she will create the world and setting in which the adventures will .be taking place and will create a variety of characters to populate the world. The DM will also develop situations taking place in that world and will then run adventures\u2014acting as the main narrator of the stories in which the other players' characters will participate.<br/><br/>The other players will create characters\u2014the heroes of the DM's story. The DM will present their characters with situations, and they'll decide how to react to those situations.

The gamemaster plays all the people the characters meet and introduces the plots that go on around the characters, drawing them into dramatic conflict. The gamemaster is like a playwright, an author and a movie director rolled into one. He is the \u201cGreek chorus\u201d when necessary, telling the players what\u2019s going on as a narrator reveals a story element. He is also an actor, playing the wheedling informant the players\u2019 characters hook up with on the black market, the vain baron who seeks the characters\u2019 aid in rescuing his daughter, or the jolly innkeeper who is kind enough to extend the characters credit, because he likes their faces.</p>\n<p>The gamemaster creates the plots that move the story forward, but it is the players who decide how their characters will react to the people and machinations active around them. Each player is like an actor taking on a role, but she is also a co-author of the drama, along with the gamemaster and the other characters. She decides who her character is and how that character reacts to the story.</p>\n<p>Unlike a novel or film, a roleplaying game is a truly interactive experience, created from an interplay between the gamemaster and the players. The gamemaster introduces a conflict, the players react to it as they see fit (within the guidelines of their character concepts and characters\u2019 knowledge), and the gamemaster, taking the players\u2019 reactions into account, adjusts his plot as needed and introduces the next conflict. Players speak their characters\u2019 dialogue, all spontaneously in reaction to the gamemaster\u2019s plot. Roleplaying is even more interactive than computer games touted for their interactivity; no computer can yet match the sheer variability introduced into roleplaying games by clever players. It\u2019s an adage that you can never guess what a player will do in a roleplaying game, and it\u2019s a true one. </p>\n<p>One important rule to remember is that roleplaying games are not won or lost like traditional board or video games. There are no scores to tally up. Regardless of whether the characters win or lose their struggles, it is the playing of the game itself \u2014 the flow of imagination and interaction \u2014 that determines whether or not a game succeeds.</p>\n<p><strong>Fading Suns, 2nd Edition (1999)</strong></p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387938">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387938/#Comment_387938" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-23T12:34:38+00:00" title="August 23, 2012 12:34PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Roleplaying Game:</b> We assume you\u2019ve already got this covered.

It is not a single player<br/>game. In fact, it works best with three to<br/>six people. The group uses the rules to<br/>create a world, decide what the conflict on<br/>the world will encompass, build characters<br/>who are a part of that conflict and then play<br/>out the fate of the world as mirrored by the<br/>struggles of the characters. One player plays<br/>the opposition to the main group, and both<br/>sides play to win.<br/><br/>These conflicts and struggles are resolved using the abilities of<br/>characters within the context of the game\u2019s structure.

I ask them, \u201cAre you prepared to<br/>accept the consequences of your actions?\u201d<br/><br/>In the game, players take on the roles of characters inspired<br/>by history, current events and works of science fiction. These<br/>characters are represented by a series of numbers that designate<br/>their abilities, and a list of player-determined descriptions and<br/>goals. The synergy of inspiration, imagination, numbers and<br/>priorities is the most fundamental element of Burning Empires.<br/>Manipulating these numbers and goals within situations presented<br/>by the game master (GM) is what the game is all about.<br/><br/>The mechanical consequences of the players\u2019 decisions are<br/>described in this chapter, in the World Burner, Character Burner and<br/>the Burning Wheel.

You\u2019re going to build technologies, create ideas and probably step on<br/>a few toes. You\u2019re going to earn recognition and favor from your friends and, we hope, from the<br/>rest of the station. Of course, station resources are limited\u2014 particularly space\u2014so not every idea or dream<br/>can be brought to fruition. Therefore, users spend their reputations to ensure that their ideas are produced,<br/>seen or heard. With 80,000-odd contestants, the competition for status and resources is intense.

This arrangement can change<br/>in the next session, but for now it stands.<br/><br/>The users all create unique profiles and form<br/>a group\u2014a MRCZ of their own. The MRCZ<br/>will then confront rivals and other problems in<br/>an attempt to gain individual and collective<br/>recognition.<br/><br/>The first time a group sits down together, the<br/>superuser walks the users through the profile<br/>creation process. If this is your very first time on the<br/>station, the superuser will also walk you through<br/>a challenge before starting the session in earnest.<br/>Otherwise, after each user has generated a<br/>profile, the superuser presents the users with a<br/>challenge to overcome. They are challenged to<br/>effect a small change on the station, increasing<br/>their status and reputation.<br/><br/>Bolstering your rep is never as simple or as easy<br/>as it sounds. Good luck!

The whole time, you\u2019re thinking: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t walk down those<br/>creepy stairs to the dark basement, especially without a flashlight. I\u2019d do X, Y, or Z instead!\u201d Since you\u2019re in the passenger\u2019s seat for the plot you\u2019re reading or watching, however, you simply have to sit back and let it unfold.<br/><br/>What if you could take hold of the driver\u2019s seat? What if you could take the plot in the direction you\u2019d choose? That is the essence of a roleplaying game. A roleplaying game (or RPG, for short) is part improvisational theater, part storytelling, and part game. A single person (the gamemaster) runs the game for a group of players that pretend to be characters in a fictitious world. The world could<br/>be a mystery game set in the 1920s that takes you adventuring around the globe, a fantasy realm inhabited by dragons and trolls and sword-wielding barbarians, or a science fiction setting with aliens and spaceships and world-crushing weaponry. The players pick a setting that they find cool and want to play in. The players then craft their own characters, providing a detailed history and personality to bring each to life. These characters have a set of statistics (numerical values) that represent skills, attributes, and other abilities. The gamemaster then explains the situation in which the characters find themselves. The players, through their characters, interact with the storyline and each other\u2019s characters, acting out the plot. As the players roleplay through some scenarios, the gamemaster will probably ask a given player to roll some dice and the resulting numbers will determine the success or failure of a character\u2019s attempted action. The gamemaster uses the rules of the game to interpret the dice rolls and the outcome of the character\u2019s actions.<br/><br/>As a group exercise, the players control the storyline (the adventure), which evolves much like any movie or book but within the flexible plot created by the gamemaster. This gamemaster plot provides a framework and ideas for potential courses of action and outcomes, but it is simply an outline of what might happen\u2014it is not concrete until the players become involved. If you don\u2019t want to walk down those stairs, you don\u2019t. If you think you can talk yourself out of a situation in place of pulling a gun, then try and make  it happen. The script of any roleplaying session is written by the players, and the story, based upon the character\u2019s actions and their responses to the events of the plot, will constantly change and evolve. <br/><br/>The best part is that there is no \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d way to play an RPG. Some games may involve more combat and dice rolling-related situations, where other games may involve more storytelling and improvised dialogue to resolve a situation. Each group of<br/>players decides for themselves the type and style of game they enjoy playing!<br/><br/>-<b>Eclipse Phase</b>, 2008                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_387954">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BRennekamp" title="BRennekamp"><img alt="BRennekamp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BRennekamp">BRennekamp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387954/#Comment_387954" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-23T14:27:42+00:00" title="August 23, 2012  2:27PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 23, 2012 2:33PM by BRennekamp.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>What is a Role-Playing Game?</b><br/><br/>  As strange as it seems to experienced role-players, some people (even people who have purchased this role-playing book) might not be familiar with the concept of roleplaying. This section is provided for their convenience. For those of you who know already, this is all just dead space. Pretend a pretty picture is here instead. . . .<br/><br/>  A role-playing game is a cooperative storytelling game where the players take the role of \u201ccharacters\u201d that act and interact within a fictional adventure, devised and run by the Game Moderator. The GM is responsible for the consistency of the story the Player Characters (PCs) navigate through, and for the actions of other characters the PCs interact with in the game. Each Player portrays their one character, and the GM portrays everyone else. These other characters played by the GM are called Non-Player Characters (NPCs). Obviously, this places a large amount of responsibility on the GM\u2019s shoulders. The enemy agent, the character\u2019s mother, and the President of the United States, each would be played (when necessary) by the GM, while the player is only responsible for a single personality, and a lot less trouble.<br/><br/>  The role-playing game, by nature, is rather fluid. Unlike other games, it rarely involves tedious markings and movements of pieces on a board (although this is sometimes necessary). It\u2019s much more abstract. Usually, the GM describes the situation in the adventure to the Players, explaining what the PCs see and hear. The Players tell the GM what their characters wish to do. Sometimes interaction<br/>between the PCs and the GM are resolved simply by talking; the GM decides something will happen, and it happens. Often, such decisions are made when the outcome of such an event is not in doubt (for example, a character wants to open a door, so the GM decides he does so).<br/><br/>  However, when an outcome is in doubt, such as when a PC is attacked by an NPC, or a PC wishes to complete a difficult task, the GM may ask the player to roll dice and consult the statistics of his or her character. This adds a level of excitement and uncertainty to the game. These statistics assign a numerical value to how well a character can do something, like lifting a weight, hitting someone in the jaw or shooting a gun. A successful roll made on a statistic indicates success in that particular action in the adventure<br/>and the GM continues the story accordingly. Many such rolls may be made over the course of a single adventure.<br/><br/>  Sometimes the PCs will try to resolve some linear \u201cmission\u201d within an adventure, but sometimes (unlike other games) there is no absolute goal. Like real life, the PCs act and react just like normal people, in a world of the GM\u2019s creation. Well-played PCs should be like real people, with wants, hopes, dreams and fears. Sometimes there is a short-term goal for them to accomplish, like there is in life: completing a class, delivering the newspapers, or blowing up the enemy stronghold. Ongoing role-playing games are often composed of dozens of adventures linked together to form a campaign. Campaigns cover months or even years in story time, and follow the paths of the PCs as they grow and develop.<br/><br/>  Sometimes, however, an adventure is a one-time thing. The GM prepares and presents an adventure for the PCs that runs its course in a single night, or in a short period of time.<br/><br/>  That, in a nutshell, is role-playing.<br/><br/> - <b>Godlike</b>, 2001                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BRennekamp" title="BRennekamp"><img alt="BRennekamp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BRennekamp">BRennekamp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387956/#Comment_387956" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-23T14:39:06+00:00" title="August 23, 2012  2:39PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This one was a little buried in the text, and there's some fun blurbs before it . . .<br/><br/><b>A Game of Stories</b><br/><br/>If you have never played a story game before, welcome. I\u2019ve written this game in the hopes that both experienced and brand-new players will be able to read and understand the premise, setting, and rules with minimal studying or memorization. If you\u2019re new to story games, here\u2019s a quick primer to help you understand what\u2019s happening in this book. <br/><br/>Inside this book, you will find a setting and a collection of rules that you and your friends will use to tell a story together. The  premise, the basic idea, is that there are monsters only children can see and only children can fight. The players take the part of those children and they are the focus of this game. <br/><br/>It is called a story game because it\u2019s both a storytelling device and a game. The main goal is to have a great time, to immerse yourself in fiction for a few hours, and connect and engage with characters and their struggles, setbacks, and triumphs. That\u2019s the story part. There are rules as to when and how something will happen and who will succeed. That\u2019s the game part.<br/><br/>You need at least two people to play this game. One of these people will be the game moderator and she will have a special job. The rest\u2014and a group of three to four people is ideal in my experience\u2014are called players. Players create characters and contribute to the story through those characters. Creating a character should be fun\u2014and it is even more fun when all the characters are made together. These characters are called player characters or PCs because, as you can guess, they\u2019re characters designed and controlled by the players. Every player should have a copy of the character sheet (found at the back of this book and also at www.littlefears.com) which will make creating a character faster and easier. Every character needs his own sheet. <br/><br/>One of the players is going to be the game moderator or GM. Her job is to help guide the story and also to portray the other characters, both human and monster, that are in the story. These characters are called game moderator characters or GMCs. The GM also has the responsibility of injecting the environment into the story. By that, I mean the game moderator has tools that help her respond to what characters wish to do. Throughout the story, the characters will be opposed, by other characters and by situations. They will face challenges and overcome obstacles. Otherwise, their victory or defeat lacks substance or meaning.<br/><br/>Imagine you\u2019re all making a film (this won\u2019t be the last time I draw parallels between the two). The players are the actors and they\u2019re portraying (in words, not actions) the characters in the film. The game moderator is the director, setting the scenes and putting certain player characters in the spotlight at certain times. Both the players and the game moderator will collaborate on the  screenwriting. A player will speak for his character, improvising dialogue and deciding how his character will act in a variety of different situations. The game moderator will act as everyone who isn\u2019t a player character. The rules determine who acts and speaks at what time and what happens when characters disagree or act against each other. We\u2019ll get to the details of this in the next chapter.<br/><br/>There is no winner in this game though characters will be rewarded for doing well. The game moderator\u2019s primary duty is to oppose the actions of the characters and to test the decision-making skills of the players. The game moderator is not the enemy even if she does oppose the characters and control the monsters. Every person at the table shares the goal of telling a great story. They just serve different roles in accomplishing that. <br/><br/>Everything else you need to know about Little Fears Nightmare Edition can be found within these pages.

Do not worry, because you will learn quickly. You can also learn more about this activity on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roleplaying_game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roleplaying_game</a>. The \u201cPlaying Your Character\u201d aside of this book (p.178) gives novice Players some advice to start role-playing.<br/><br/>(On p. 178)<br/>Playing a Character<br/>This aside is more particularly dedicated to novice Players, who have never played role-playing games until now. Although it may seem difficult to you, a very simple thing can help you tremendously in quickly feeling comfortable with your Character: talk about him as if you were talking about yourself.<br/><br/>Therefore, when the Leader asks you \u201cwhat do you do?\u201d, the obvious answer will be \u201cI do\u2026\u201d and not \u201cmy Character does\u2026\u201d. In the same way, when you are talking with other Characters or extras played by the Game Leader, think about talking to the other protagonists as if you were the Character, and not by using terms such as \u201cI tell him that\u2026\u201d. Say it yourself, with your words. Do not be afraid, we are in a role-playing game, not in a speaking contest. Yes, some Players have a sense of the dramatic or a vocabulary<br/>that gives them an advantage when they express themselves in this way. Do not feel compelled to do as they do. In that regard, they most certainly did not always feel so at ease\u2026<br/><br/>The other Players are not your enemies or your rivals. There is no first or last place in a role-playing game. On the contrary, most of them will be glad to help you play your PC better. Shadows of Esteren depicts a universe without a nitpicky or excessive formalism. It requires no particular historical or linguistic knowledge. If you have never played a role-playing game, it is normal you should feel somewhat apprehensive, even more so if you do not, or barely, know the other people around the table. You may feel as frightened<br/>as if you should play a part in a theater scene. However, you have two advantages actors do not have: first, you write your part yourself, and do not have to render imposed dialogues and attitudes. Second, and most importantly, the other Players are your audience, in the same way that you are theirs. Do not hesitate to ask for a quick out-of-game break to think about the way your Character should or could act at a precise moment. Quite quickly, you will become more confident and such a need will fade. At the<br/>start, do not get too preoccupied about the interpretation of your Character. Nobody expects an optimal result from you right away. The essential thing is that as the sessions go on, this PC becomes familiar and increasingly easy to handle for you. Until the moment when you will be able to \u201cput on your costume\u201d without any difficulty for the time of the game, then put it back until the next session.<br/><br/>- <b>Shadows of Esteren</b>, English Edition, 2012                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_387961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WPTunes" title="WPTunes"><img alt="WPTunes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/193/nI9P6PIU22T8F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WPTunes">WPTunes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387961/#Comment_387961" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-23T14:57:29+00:00" title="August 23, 2012  2:57PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Should the reader match the description of that increasingly elusive beast, the first-time roleplayer, then a most hearty welcome to you!

Some think it is interactive storytelling, others emphasize immersion into the character, or competition, or achieving the objectives placed on your character or whatever. From the perspective of this rulebook it doesn't really matter but play sessions usually work better when everybody is on the same page on what they expect to experience<br/><br/>In a roleplaying game, the player assumes the role of an imaginary person in an imaginary world and directs his actions. Imagine you're reading a book. A big part of the enjoyment comes from being able to identify with the protagonist. The reader celebrates his victories and grieves his losses, laughing and crying with him. A book also offers a window into the imaginary world inside the author's head. However, a book's events are set and the reader can only see what the author has decided to show him. In a roleplaying game these limitations do not exist: <i>you</i> decide what the character does and where he goes. Even though you can make some assumptions on the characters' actions in a roleplaying game, the entire world is open to them.<br/><br/>[...]<br/><br/><b>Stalker (2012)</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_387965">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WPTunes" title="WPTunes"><img alt="WPTunes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/193/nI9P6PIU22T8F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WPTunes">WPTunes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387965/#Comment_387965" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-23T16:35:43+00:00" title="August 23, 2012  4:35PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p><strong>What is a Role Playing Game?</strong></p>\n<p>Role playing games, or RPGs, are a form of collaborative storytelling.

Players create fictional heroes and explore shared worlds populated by computer-controlled creatures and, in online games, accessed by a multitude of other players. The One Ring is a pen-and-paper version of the same type of game, with players meeting face-to-face around a table and the computer replaced by one person \u2013 the Loremaster \u2013 acting as narrator and referee.<br/><br/>Each player plays the role of a single character during the game. The player designs every part of the character, from personality to appearance, and chooses its skills and abilities. Players are encouraged to play \u2018in character\u2019 as much as possible, as this helps to bring the game alive. <br/><br/>The Loremaster doesn\u2019t take the role of a character, but is instead in charge of describing the setting and managing what happens to the players when they interact with the game world. He begins each session of play by setting the scene, plays the parts of the people and creatures the characters encounter, and adjudicates the consequences of the heroes\u2019 actions. Gameplay takes the form of a continuous conversation between the Loremaster and his players; a dialogue that, with the help of the rules, gives birth to a story that is created by and enjoyed by everyone involved.<br/><br/>As much as The One Ring is a storytelling experience, it remains a game. To play it, everybody relies on a set of rules not very different from those of a traditional board game. Dice are used to determine the success \u2013 or failure \u2013 of the characters\u2019 most important actions (with more simple actions resolved through common sense). The rules for the game are straightforward and easy to learn and, most importantly, should not interfere with everybody having a good time.<br/><br/>- <b>The One Ring</b>, 2011                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_387998">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387998/#Comment_387998" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-23T23:58:38+00:00" title="August 23, 2012 11:58PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 23, 2012 11:59PM by JDCorley.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As for White Wolf games, virtually all of them from 1992-1998 period (Vampire 2nd Edition, Werewolf 2nd, Mage, Changeling, Wraith) used identical language for the central element but surrounded it with 2-3 pages or so of more specific-to-the-game ideas. Here's the core language:\n<blockquote>Changeling is a storytelling game, but it is also a roleplaying game. As a Changeling player, you not only tell stories, but actually act through them by assuming the roles of the central characters. It's a lot like theater, but you make up the lines. <br/><br/>To understand roleplaying, you need only think back to your childhood and those wonderful afternoons spent playing Cops 'n Robbers, Cowboys and Indians, or Dress-Up. What you were doing was roleplaying, a sort of spontaneous and natural acting that completely occupied your imagination. This play-acting helped you learn about life and what it meant to be a grown-up. It was an essential part of childhood, but just because you have grown up doesn't mean you have to stop.<br/><br/>In Changeling, unlike pretend, there are a few rules to help you roleplay. They are used mainly to avoid arguments - Bang! Bang! You're Dead! No I'm not! - and to add a deeper sense of realism to the story. Rules direct and guide the story's progress and help define the characters' capacities and weaknesses. --- <b>Changeling: the Dreaming, 1995</b></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388109/#Comment_388109" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-24T14:04:25+00:00" title="August 24, 2012  2:04PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This "game", as the folks in R&amp;D refer to it, is a combination of 'Choose Your Own Path' and improvisational acting, with a bit of strategy and a dollop of problem-solving thrown into the mix. One person, designated as the Director, runs the adventures, presenting information about the setting, speaking for the villains and minor characters, and adjudicating the rules.

You will create a set of numbers and characteristics that will give you a clear idea of how your character things, acts, what he/she cares about and what he/she can do.<br/><br/>One of you will take on a different role, that of the Referee (or Gamemaster), the person who presents the story plot to the players, controls any characters not controlled by the players themselves, and applies the rules of the game. The Referee must have a firm grasp of the game rules and the fictional background in which the world is set. It's the most demanding position in terms of time, energy, and imagination - a lot like directing a play when you can't control all the actors - but it can be very rewarding as well. --- <b>Bubblegum Crisis - Megatokyo 2033 - The Roleplaying Game, 1996</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388114">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388114/#Comment_388114" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-24T14:17:50+00:00" title="August 24, 2012  2:17PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As the name indicates, role-playing means that the participants play roles. Kult is a game where the players control fictional characters in a frightful world of shadows, secrets, cults and madmen. The characters are bewhildered existences who chase knowledge, fight powers from beyond death, or from their own subconscious. The players act like actors in a radio theater.<br/><br/>But role-playing is not theater. The participants tell a story together. They don't actually walk around and do the things that happen in the game, but they tell the Gamemaster what their characters do, and they say the things that their characters say. Some players are contented to simply state what their characters do, others identify with their roles and try to act and speak like their characters. The choice is yours. Everyone plays in his own fashion and no way is better than another. The adventures in Kult will become more exciting if the players try to enter their characters' minds, so to speak, just like actors do. But they should not feel any pressure to perform--that detracts from the fun.

It's a game that offers a multitude of choices - more choices than even the most sophisticated computer game, because the only limit to what you can do is what you can imagine. The story unfolds like a movie, except all of the action takes place in your imagination. There's no script to follo, other than a rough outline used by the Gamemaster (GM); you decide what your character says and does. The Gamemaster, as the director and special effects designer, decides what the story is about and takes on the roles of all the other characters - the villains, the extras, the distinctive guest stars. The Gamemaster also keeps track of the rules, interprets the outcome of te actions, and describes what happens. Together, players and GM create a story, and everyone has a great time.<br/>- <b>D20 Modern Core Rulebook</b><br/><br/>The recurring comparisons to other media (video games, film) are very interesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388122">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388122/#Comment_388122" name="Item_89" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-24T14:43:58+00:00" title="August 24, 2012  2:43PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What Is a Roleplaying Game?<br/>Dragon Age is what\u2019s known as a tabletop roleplaying<br/>game, so named because you usually play while sitting<br/>around a table with your friends.

People come together to tell legends and tales, and to learn. A storytelling game like this one lets you and your friends make your own stories. Mage: The Ascension is White Wolf\u2019s game of belief, heroism, hubris and enlightenment. With these rules, you can make stories about your own mages and their destinies. The rules of this book show you how to build a character \u2014 an alter-ego in the game \u2014 and then tell a story with that character. Each player takes on a role, much like an actor in a play. However, this story isn 't pre-scripted; each player describes what his or her mage says and does. In the world of the game, each mage has his share of triumphs and tragedies. The telling of that tale is the fun of the game. Of course, the outcome of the story is no more set than the courses of our own lives. In some cases, then, the rules in this book offer guidance for resolving situations where chance sways the tale. The important thing is to develop the character's personality and capabilities through the course of events. Remember: The name of the game is storytelling. Rules are just convenient constructions for adjudicating chance occurrences with some consistency and fairness. The rules aren't the point of the game, so they should always give way to a mystical, rousing story.<br/>- <b>Mage: The Ascension 2nd Edition</b> (2000)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388126">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388126/#Comment_388126" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-24T14:50:19+00:00" title="August 24, 2012  2:50PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Roleplaying<br/>Changeling is a storytelling game, but it is also a roleplaying game. As a Changeling player, you not only tell stories, but actually act through them by assuming the roles of the central characters. It's a lot like theatre, but you make up the lines. To understand roleplaying, you need only think back to your childhood and those wonderful afternoons spent playing Cops 'n' Robbers, Cowboys and Indians, or Dress-Up. What you were doing was roleplaying, a sort of spontaneous and natural acting that completely occupied your imagination. This playacting helped you learn about life and what it meant to be a grown-up. It was an essential part of childhood, but just because you have grown up doesn't mean you have to stop.<br/><br/>In Changeling, unlike pretend, there are a few rules to help you roleplay. They are used mainly to avoid arguments \u2014 "Bang! Bang! You're dead!" "No I'm not!" \u2014 and to add a deeper sense of realism to the story. Rules direct and guide the story's progress and help define the characters' capacities and weaknesses.<br/><br/>Changeling can be played with nearly any number of players, but roleplaying games in general work best with six or fewer players. Mystery and flavor are diminished when players must compete for attention.<br/><br/>The Storyteller<br/>Changeling is structured a little differently from the games with which you might be familiar. In the first place, there is no board. Second, one player must assume the role of Storyteller\u2014 the person who creates and guides the stories. Being the Storyteller is a bit like playing the Banker in Monopoly \u2122, but bears greater responsibilities and rewards than control over a handful of play money. The Storyteller describes what happens to the characters as a result of the players' words and actions. She decides if the characters succeed or fail, suffer or prosper, live or die. Storytelling is a very demanding task, but it is equally rewarding, for the Storyteller is a weaver of legends.<br/><br/>The Storyteller's primary duty is to make sure the other players have a good time. The way to do that is to tell a good tale. Unlike traditional storytellers, however, the Storyteller doesn't simply tell the story. Instead, she creates the skeleton of a story, and then lets the players flesh it out by assuming the roles of its leading characters.<br/><br/>Storytelling in Changeling is a careful balance between narration and adjudication, between story and game. Sometimes the Storyteller must set the scene or describe what occurs, but mostly she must decide how the environment responds to the characters. She must be as realistic, impartial and creative as possible.<br/><br/>As the Storyteller, you are in charge of interpreting and enforcing the rules, yet you are also an entertainer \u2014 you must struggle to balance your two roles. This book was written to help you do just that. It won't make being a Storyteller easy, because it never will be easy, but it will make you better at it.<br/> <br/>Players<br/>Most Changeling players will not be Storytellers. They will instead assume the roles of the central characters in the story. Being a player does not require as much responsibility as being a Storyteller, but it does require just as much effort and concentration.<br/><br/>As a player in a Changeling chronicle, you assume the persona and role of a changeling \u2014 a faerie being whom you invent and then roleplay over the course of one or several stories. The life of your character is in your hands, for you decide what the character says and does. You decide which risks to accept or decline. Everything you say and do when you play your character has an effect on the world.<br/><br/>You must also be an actor. You speak for your character and act out whatever you want your character to do or say. Whatever you say, your character says, unless you are specifically asking the Storyteller a question or are describing your actions. As a player, you try to do things that allow your character to succeed and thus "win the game." This strategic element of the game is essential, for it is what so often creates the thrill and excitement of a dramatic moment.<br/><br/>Often, after describing the actions "you" want to take, ydu may have to make dice rolls to see if your character successfully accomplishes what you have illustrated with words. Your character's Traits numbers quantifying her strengths and weaknesses \u2014 dictate how well your character can do certain things. Actions are basic elements of Changeling, for it is through actions that characters change the world and affect the course of the story.<br/><br/>Characters are central to a story, for they alter and direct the plot. Without characters you can't have a story. As the story flows, the characters, not the decisions of the Storyteller, direct and energize the progress of the plot.<br/><br/>To some extent, each player is an assistant Storyteller. Players should feel free to add ideas and elements to the story, although the Storyteller may accept or reject them as she sees fit. In the end, a good story is the most important goal. Players and Storytellers work together to make a story come to life.<br/><br/>Characters<br/>Many different elements compose what we think of as the "self \u2014 too many, in fact, to separate or identify. We really don't know who or what we are. It is from this essential diversity of self that our desire and ability to pretend to be someone else originate.<br/><br/>Characters are the literary versions of real people \u2014 they are not real, but they do capture some aspects of reality. Only when you enter the world of the story can your characters become complete. They are real only with you as the animating force \u2014 the soul, if you wish. Treat your characters as unique individuals, as works of art, or as fragile expressions of your poetic sensitivity. You must treasure the characters that you create.<br/><br/>Changeling characters are easy to create. It takes less than half an hour to choose all the Traits that describe your character. It takes more time and effort to turn this collection of numbers into a living, breathing character. You must reach deep inside yourself to produce a complete character. The Frankenstein monster was easily assembled from available body parts; it was the breath of life that proved difficult.<br/><br/>Winners and Losers<br/>There is no single "winner" of Changeling, for the object is not to defeat the other players. To "win" at all, players need to cooperate with each other. Because this is a Storytelling game, there is no way for one person to claim victory. Moreover, the Changeling world is fraught with danger: monstrous chimera, implacable Dauntain, ever-encroaching Banality and the machinations of the Unseelie Court. Players cannot afford to squabble with their brethren, for so doing leads to death \u2014 and the only true measure of success in Changeling is survival. If, however, a character has some overwhelming motivation (such as aneed for vengeance), accomplishing this goal also becomes a measure of success. Stories and extended chronicles often come to conclusions that either benefit or harm the characters. If the players can turn stories to their characters' advantage, they have "won," at least for the moment. When a group of changelings manages to rescue a fellow changeling who has been captured by one of the Dauntain, those changelings can be considered to have "won" a temporary victory. If the Dauntain has powerful friends among the occult underground, however, attacking that individual may prove a dangerous exercise in the long run. A "victory" under these circumstances can become worse than defeat.<br/><br/>To achieve even partial victory, characters must usually become friends, or at least watch out for and have a modicum of trust in each other. The World of Darkness is a dangerous place, so trustworthy allies are essential. A divided group will not survive for long.<br/><br/>- <b>Changeling: The Dreaming 2nd Edition</b> (2000)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388176">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner" title="Evan_Torner"><img alt="Evan_Torner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/278/nHOYP3VNJB6A6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner">Evan_Torner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388176/#Comment_388176" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-25T06:11:35+00:00" title="August 25, 2012  6:11AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 25, 2012 6:12AM by Evan_Torner.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In a role-playing game, you direct the actions of a fictional character of your own devising through a series of adventures run by a player who takes on the role of <i><b>Game Moderator,</b></i> or <b><i>GM</i></b>.

(John's Answer)</b> <br/><br/>If you don't know, or you're just curious to see what I'd say, here's how I describe what a roleplaying game is. The analogy here comes courtesy of game designer Greg Stafford.<br/><br/>A roleplaying game is like <i>improvisational radio theater.</i><br/><br/>It's <i>theater</i> because each layer in the game portrays a single character, just as an actor on stage does. Each player creates his own character, and each time e plays, the character becomes more and more believable because of the time invested in portraying him. (Much as a television series: the main chracters in the first episode of the long-running comedy <i>Cheers</i> became a lot richer and more entertaining as the series went on, as the actors and writers got to know them better.) Also like theater, the game presents a story, rich with drama, mystery, excitement, and all those other things that the Geeks bequeathed to the western world through theater. <br/><br/>It's <i>radio</i> theater because unlike a stage play, the game's players don't walk around or use props, and there is no set. (Yes, there are exceptions, but let's keep this simple.) Typically, a roleplaying game is payed around a table, which means that players mostly use their voices, faces, and gestures to portray their character. Instead of seeing a stage set with furniture, walls and props, the locations and items in a roleplaying game story are described verbally and are often assumed to be there without being described. If a scene takes place in a warehouse, you don't ned to be told that there are large crates, forklifts and similar stuff. You can just get a simple description and move on.<br/><br/>It's <i>improvisational</i> radio theater because there is no script. Dialogue is made up on the spot, improvisationally, by the players. The story for the game will have been created, but it's a rough outline of events, not a moment-by-moment description like a script for a play or movie. The players all work together, through their characters, to both <i>follow</i> and <i>lead</i>the story. They follow it when events occur beyond their control - for instance, it could start raining, or someone the characters haven't met before could knock on their door - but most of the time they lead it, by making decisions and taking action to pursue their goals. No one knows for sure what's going to happen in the story of the game, and in particular the ending is very much up for grabs. The story is told improvisationally, which is both the major challenge and the core entertainment of roleplaying games. <br/><br/>Although the players only play one character each, there is a different kind of player. This player is like the director of your improvisational radio theater. He works out and presents the story, he plays the role of all the characters in the story beside the players' characters, and he guides the flow of the game. He is also responsible for  judging the rules of the game, which are used to introduce an exciting random element to the story, and also to resolve what happens when characters come into some form of physical, magickal, or psychological conflict. This different kind of player is often known by a lot of different titles, including referee, narrator, game master, storyteller, dungeon master and on and on. We're going to use game master - or just GM for short - but you can use whatever title you want. <br/><br/>If you've never played a roleplaying game before, it can be tough to learn on your own. The best way to learn is to find people who play roleplaying games and either watch them play for a while, or, preferably, join in and play with them. Hobby shops often provide ways to meet up with other players, and many universities and schools have official groups that meet regularly to play roleplaying games. <br/><br/><b> - John Tynes, Unknown Armies, 1998</b><br/><br/><b>What is a Roleplaying Game? (Greg's Answer)</b><br/>Personally, I'd call roleplaying games an attempt to get inside a story in a way that older forms of literature and entertainment (such as movies, novels and short stories) do not allow. When you read Paradise Lost, you're a passive observer. When you watch Casablanca, you can't tell Ilsa Lund to pick Rick instead of Victor. In a roleplaying game we can finally satisfy the frustrated novelist, screen-writer, and actor that many of us have inside.<br/><br/>It's not exactly the same, however. With a novel, the writer controls the outcome and the reader gets the thrill of novelty, suspense and surprise. A player in a roleplaying game keeps that pleasurable uncertainty, but in addition has some of the writer's power over the plot. Specifically, the player "writes" the actions and reaction of one specific character. <br/><br/>In order to keep the suspense, there has to be uncertainty. That's where the <i>game</i> element of a roleplaying game comes in. The uncertainty has to be genuine, not simulated; the suspense is badly cut if you now your character is going to succeed (or even just survive) no matter what he or she tries. The rules, the funny-shaped dice, and the mechanics governing the failure or success of an action are all in place to provide support for the story. There are games where the GM simple decides the outcome based on gut feelings, and they can be just as fun as ay other type of game, but for a setting like this one, full of treachery, uncertainty, and unpredictable <i>weirdness</i>, a high degree of chaos is desirable.<br/><br/><b> - Greg Stolze, Unknown Armies, 1998</b><br/><br/>It sucks that that was cut from content in the 2nd Edition of the book.

Like the name implies, it is about<br/>playing a role, essentially a version of the childhood game of \u201clet\u2019s pretend\u201d with rules and dice<br/>used to determine the outcome of actions. Although roleplaying games have been around in various<br/>forms for decades, they haven\u2019t changed all that much from the childhood essentials \u2014 up to and<br/>including sometimes protracted \u201cDid so!\u201d \u201cDid not!\u201d arguments, thus the need for a Game Master.<br/>Essentially, the Game Master is both narrator and referee. The GM comes up with a situation, the<br/>start or \u201chook\u201d of a story, and presents it to the players. They, in turn, decide what their characters<br/>will do. The GM responds with what happens next, and from their interaction a complete story<br/>unfolds. Along the way, the heroes encounter challenges, including fights with villains, and the<br/>game rules help the players and Game Master to resolve the outcome of those challenges,<br/>changing the direction of the story. A part of the thrill of a roleplaying game is that it is fiction you<br/>and your friends create together!<br/>- <b>ICONS: Superpowered Roleplaying</b> (2010)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388208">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner" title="Evan_Torner"><img alt="Evan_Torner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/278/nHOYP3VNJB6A6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner">Evan_Torner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388208/#Comment_388208" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-25T10:18:32+00:00" title="August 25, 2012 10:18AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>What is a Roleplaying Game?</b><br/>A Roleplaying Game, RPG for short, is a system of rules that define the way a player may interact with an imaginary world. Roleplaying is nothing more than the art of pretending, though some refer to it as acting. Games such as this one allow the player experience scenarios, morality and experiences otherwise unavailable. Like all games, roleplaying is meant to be fun, and accomplishes this with the stimulation of the imagination in the company of friends through the use of strategy and storytelling.<br/><br/>In this game, the storyteller and guide, referred to as the <b>Seneschal</b>, uses the rules contained here-in to create an interactive story-line for the players' characters to explore. The Seneschal verbally paints a picture of the world in which the characters are immersed, and creates events to challenge the players' wits, acting skill, patience and luck. While the player controls a character's actions, the accomplishment of these actions is left to fate. Gamers use dice to attempt to successfully achieve a character's physical actions, but must rely on their brains to solve mysteries and their wits to avoid dangerous situations. The point? To have fun. Roleplaying is like reading an unpredictable book, where you are writing the story, but have no idea what will occur next. Unlike video games, RPGs force you to interact with actual people! People who are unpredictable, often hilarious, and hopefully a lot more interesting than a glowing box.<br/><br/>Like all games and many RPGs, <i>The Riddle of Steel</i> involves elements of chance, skill, and strategy \u2013 the three are, in fact, tightly related. Chance is represented by the use of special dice (discussed below) while strategy is found in <i>how</i> and <i>when</i> you use those dice. Skill is learned over time, as not only the character, but the player also improves. To start the game you will need to acquire pencils, paper, a copy of this book, and dice.<br/><br/><b>\u2013 Riddle of Steel (2001)</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner" title="Evan_Torner"><img alt="Evan_Torner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/278/nHOYP3VNJB6A6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner">Evan_Torner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388209/#Comment_388209" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-25T10:49:36+00:00" title="August 25, 2012 10:49AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 26, 2012 6:51AM by Evan_Torner.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For reference of folks like myself, <a href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">@JDCorley</a>, <a href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch">@Will_Hindmarch</a> or others who want to do something with this list.<br/><b><br/>Inventory of Games Listed on this Thread as of <i>This</i> Post</b><br/><br/>Dungeons &amp; Dragons (1977)<br/>Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons (1978)<br/>Gamma World (1978)<br/>Top Secret (1980)<br/>Dungeons &amp; Dragons (1981)<br/>Star Frontiers (1982)<br/>Gamma World (1983)<br/>Marvel Super Heroes Basic Set (1984)<br/>Toon (1984)<br/>Gamma World (1986)<br/>Dungeons &amp; Dragons (1991)<br/>Kult (1993)<br/>Castle Falkenstein (1994)<br/>Changeling (1995)<br/>Bubblegum Crisis (1996)<br/>Feng Shui (1996)<br/>Men in Black (1997)<br/>Unknown Armies (1998)<br/>7th Sea (1999)<br/>Fading Suns (1999)<br/>Violence (1999)<br/>Witchcraft (1999)<br/>Changeling (2000)<br/>Gamma World (2000)<br/>Mage (2000)<br/>Exalted  (2001)<br/>Godlike (2001)<br/>Riddle of Steel (2001)<br/>D20 Modern (2002) - listed twice<br/>Ars Magica (2003)<br/>Dogs in the Vineyard (2004)<br/>World Of Darkness (2004)<br/>Dread (2005)<br/>The Mountain Witch (2005)<br/>Shadowrun (2005)<br/>True20 Adventure Roleplaying (2005)<br/>Burning Empires (2006)<br/>Mortal Coil (2006)<br/>Trail of Cthulhu (2007)<br/>Cthulhutech (2008)<br/>A Dirty World (2008)<br/>Dungeons &amp; Dragons (2008)<br/>Eclipse Phase (2008)<br/>Exalted (2008)<br/>Maschine Zeit (2008)<br/>Solar System (2008)<br/>Starblazer Adventures (2008)<br/>Little Fears (2009)<br/>Pathfinder Roleplaying (2009)<br/>Adventures in Oz (2009)<br/>Corporation RPG (2009)<br/>Terror Network (2009)<br/>Apocalypse World (2010)<br/>Battletech: A Time of War (2010)<br/>Dragon Age (2010)<br/>Freemarket (2010)<br/>ICONS Superheroic Roleplaying (2010) - listed twice<br/>Strands of Fate (2010)<br/>The Wildlings (2010)<br/>Argyle &amp; Crew (2011)<br/>The One Ring (2011)<br/>Steampunkfitters (2011)<br/>Call of Cthulhu (2012)<br/>Shadowrun (2012)<br/>Shadows of Esteren (2012)<br/>Stalker (2012)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388210">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388210/#Comment_388210" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-25T10:59:29+00:00" title="August 25, 2012 10:59AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It might also be interesting to list games that DON'T answer the "What is an RPG" question.

roleplayers. It doesn\u2019t dwell on common terms and concepts. To learn more about roleplaying games, try Wikipedia\u2019s article at:<br/><br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roleplaying_game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roleplaying_game</a><br/><br/>Roleplaying is a form of cooperative storytelling. In <b>\xc6ternal Legends</b>, most players take on the role of Legends: adventurers with special powers. One player is the GM (Game Master). He portrays villains, allies and bystanders, describes the world and introduces conflicts to move the story along. The GM also "chairs" the group during discussions about how to apply a particular game rule.<br/><br/>This last point brings up something specific to <b>\xc6ternal Legends</b> and other <b>Ready2Run</b> system games. The rules are "high trust:" loosely designed, so that different groups can interpret them to taste. Some groups will want to apply Aptitudes broadly and on the fly, while others want clearly defined limits. Make sure your group is prepared to trust each other and apply the rules in ways that best suit the games you all want to play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388217">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388217/#Comment_388217" name="Item_102" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-25T12:51:06+00:00" title="August 25, 2012 12:51PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>It might also be interesting to list games that DON'T answer the "What is an RPG" question.

Player Characters, NPCs, Encounters, and even the World itself can all be created by your players while sitting at the game table. In fact, creating these things is one of the unique charms of the game. <br/><br/>Players who are joining you to play <i>Mystic Empyrean</i> will be excited by the prospect of creating their own worlds, and will want to lead the rest of the party in exploring these places. Even if you and the other players at your table are not experienced storytellers, have no fear. This book contains information that will give you the power to generate stories and spark imagination, as we ll as a storycrafting process that helps players collaboratively reinforce one another\u2019s storytelling.<br/><br/>The rule of thumb is to follow the direction of the player who currently holds the title of GM (Game Master) and to play through situations that arise according to the GM\u2019s instructions. Avoid looking up rules or breaking into side discussions during gameplay \u2013 instead focus on the story and the characters, and let the mechanics of <i>Mystic Empyrean</i> fade into the background. The story is the game \u2013 the mechanics are just there to facilitate it.<br/><br/><b>The Golden Rules of Roleplaying Games</b>\n<ol>\n<li>Whenever the rules get in the way of the story, the story takes precedence.</li>\n<li>The GM has the final say in all disputes.</li>\n<li>When in doubt, take whatever course of action keeps the game, and the story, moving forwards.</li></ol> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388233">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388233/#Comment_388233" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-25T15:59:29+00:00" title="August 25, 2012  3:59PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is an AWESOME Thread.<br/><br/>How come none of these start "O MUSE?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388246">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner" title="Evan_Torner"><img alt="Evan_Torner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/278/nHOYP3VNJB6A6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner">Evan_Torner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388246/#Comment_388246" name="Item_106" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-25T20:26:39+00:00" title="August 25, 2012  8:26PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>What is a roleplaying game?<br/>What is this game?<br/>How do I play?<br/>What is this book?<br/>Who am I?<br/>What am I doing here?<br/>Why are you holding a knife?</b><br/><br/>This is a roleplaying game so fuck off if you don\u2019t know what that is.

Each player plays a character, making the decisions and saying the things the character would say in the situations that hap- pen. One player, the Gamemaster (GM) acts like the author and director of the play; he \u201csets the stage,\u201d telling the players where they are, what is happening, and what other characters (the Non-Player Characters, or NPCs) are saying and doing. The GM guides the action but does not control it; the results of the game depend both on the players and the GM. More simply, roleplaying is just like the \u201ccops and robbers\u201d or \u201cplaying house\u201d games you played as a kid, only this time with rules to help guide you, and situations that are more complex and interesting.<br/><br/><b>\u2013Fuzion (1997)</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388251">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner" title="Evan_Torner"><img alt="Evan_Torner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/278/nHOYP3VNJB6A6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner">Evan_Torner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388251/#Comment_388251" name="Item_109" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-25T20:42:02+00:00" title="August 25, 2012  8:42PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also: <b>FUDGE (1995)</b> and <b>Hero System (2008)</b> notably have no explanation for what an RPG is.<br/><br/>Nor does <b>kill puppies for satan (2001)</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388281/#Comment_388281" name="Item_110" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-26T06:17:32+00:00" title="August 26, 2012  6:17AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 26, 2012 8:21AM by Emily_Care.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Basics<br/><br/>During a Dread game you and your friends will create characters to populate your own brand of horror story. It may take several hours to accomplish this, or even several nights, and it will require some preparation. Within this book you will find a set of rules and guidelines that will help you with this endeavor. However, it is important that you remember the ultimate goal is the story itself. If any part of this book or its contents gets in the way, feel free to alter or ignore it as you see fit. <br/><br/>To play, you will need yourself and at least one other person, though it is recommended that you gather about five to six players in total. The majority of you will be playing the roles of characters caught in a tale of horror--one character to a player. One of you will have the fortune (fair or foul) to host the game. Who among you shall take up this mantle is a choice for your group to make. All players have responsibilities in the game, but the host's are unique. The host will create the basic framework for the story and will be the arbiter of all the conflicts the characters find themselves in. The host will also take on the roles of all the other characters that aren't played by the other players. Because the duties of the host are slightly more involved, the majority of this book is dedicated to them. <br/><br/>In addition to players, you will need a sturdy flat surface; plenty of scratch paper; pens or pencils; and the tower (see sidebar and the next chapter). It may also be useful to have this book handy--at least for the first few times you play. Eventually, once your group finds its particular style and rhythm, you will find this book useless. In fact, it can become a hindrance if you are constantly referencing it. Once that happens, we encourage you to pass it on. <br/><br/><b>- <i>Dread</i>, The Impossible Dream, First Edition (2005)</b><br/><br/>Doh!

This is why it is known as a <i>role-playing game</i>. Unlike conventional wargames, in which the troops maneuvered on the table have no personality, in fantasy gaming each little metal figure becomes endowed with life and character. How this is achieved is explained later, but in essence, dice throws are used to determine various aspects of each character \u2013 strength, build, agility, intelligence, social status, wealth, psychic ability, etc. \u2013 and these determine how he or she will behave during the game. A record of all these characteristics is kept on a card by each player, as they may change during the course of the game.<br/>[...]<br/><br/><b>\u2013Fantasy Wargaming (1981)</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388285">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner" title="Evan_Torner"><img alt="Evan_Torner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/278/nHOYP3VNJB6A6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner">Evan_Torner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388285/#Comment_388285" name="Item_112" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-26T06:50:14+00:00" title="August 26, 2012  6:50AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>What Kind of Game Is This?</b><br/><br/><i>Galactic</i> is what's commonly referred to as a role-playing game. I'm not certain how well the title fits, but the term has been around for more than thirty years; we're pretty much stuck with it. A few of Galactic's contemporaries opt for variations on the term, and you might encounter various personalities on the Internet arguing over what is and isn't a role-playing game by definition. It doesn't matter much to me what you decide to call it in the end, just so long as you know what it's all about.<br/><br/>Is it even a game? If your definition of a game requires a spirit of competition, then it isn't. Even when you aren't keeping score in a football game, you're still trying to do better than the person opposite you. In Galactic, it's more like you're all on the same team together. Maybe you'll prefer to call it a 'playset' or 'toolkit.'<br/><br/>As for the term role-playing, I suppose that depends on whether you have ever played a role-playing game and whether you have any preconceived notions of what a role-playing game ought to be. There are many who would not include Galactic in the category and might instead describe it as a 'story game' or something similar. The results in any case will be the same; you'll tell a story as a group with multiple characters. Some players will take on the responsibility for the decisions of various characters, and in that sense they're 'playing the roles' of those characters, but different players may have different expectations of what those responsibilities are. Do you do so as if you were an actor, making up a voice and speaking exclusively as the character? Some games assume as much. In Galactic, you don't have to do that. Is it still a role-playing game?

In this game you play super heroes in the Marvel Universe, like the Avengers, Fantastic Four, or the X-Men. As a player, it's your job to make decisions for your super hero, using your knowledge of his motivation and personality as a guide to how he uses his amazing powers and abilities. Players are like comic book writers and artists\u2014they bring these super heroes to life, making the big and small choices for them, and that's what you'll do at the game table. <br/><br/>One player has a special job\u2014the Watcher, after the enigmatic figure of the same name who observes the many timelines of the Marvel Universe and interferes from time to time at the behest of fate. This player is responsible for maintaining the coherent universe around the super heroes. The Watcher needs to know the rules well enough to determine the outcomes of the heroes' decisions, to present those consequences to the players, and to move things along at a good pace. Often this means playing the part of super villains, helpful allies, and innocent bystanders.<br/><br/>In a roleplaying game, your fate lies with the whims of the dice and the Watcher, but your choices lead the charge. At every decision point, the direction of the story changes. Everyone shares their ideas, describes what their heroes (or villains!) are doing, and reveals an on-going story. You might even describe what you're imagining in terms of panels and pages in a comic book\u2014establishing shots, splash pages, extreme close ups, huge sound effects. At the heart of this game is you, working with the other players and the Watcher to be awesome. When you've had a hard day of school or work, or you're frustrated with your neighbor or the news, it's fun to get in character, ham it up a little with your friends, and play a Marvel super hero!<br/><br/><b>Marvel Heroic Roleplaying (2012)</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388448">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner" title="Evan_Torner"><img alt="Evan_Torner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/278/nHOYP3VNJB6A6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner">Evan_Torner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388448/#Comment_388448" name="Item_115" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-27T12:47:24+00:00" title="August 27, 2012 12:47PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>What are roleplaying games?</b><br/><br/>A roleplaying game is you with a group of friends pretending to be some other people.

Your character can head off to explore the world, take part in convoluted intrigues, wage war against rival houses, and just about anything else you can come up with. But it is still a game, and as a game, this book has rules, guidelines designed to help players and Narrators tell the stories they wish to tell in a way that\u2019s both consistent and fun. As you make ready to dive into the rest of this rulebook, you should know a few things up front. These basic game concepts should help you along and give you an idea what all the numbers mean.<br/><br/><b>The Basics</b><br/><br/><i>A Song of Ice and Fire Roleplaying</i> (SIFRP) is a game in which the players take up the roles of notables in Westeros, distinctive personas that have a place and purpose within the larger society that makes up the Seven Kingdoms. These personas are called player characters (PCs) or just characters. In most games, each player creates just one character and uses that character to interact with the imagined setting in structured or unstructured scenarios called stories. The PCs, then, are the principal characters\u2014the protagonists\u2014of the story.<br/><br/>Of course, a story rarely tells itself, and while the players make the decisions about how their characters act and react in response to certain developments in the game, the world does unfold around them, their nemeses still plot and connive in the shadows, and their foes take steps against them. Each player is in charge of his or her particular character, but who, then, is charge of the rest of the world? The Narrator.<br/><br/>The Narrator has the best job of all. It may very well be entertaining to portray a particular character, but the Narrator doesn\u2019t have to settle on just one: the Narrator gets to play them all. The Narrator plays the villains, the minions, and all the other supporting characters who help make up the story. Furthermore, the Narrator also shapes the story, decides on the plot, what happens when, and is clued in on all the things that go on in the background. The Narrator might use a published story from Green Ronin such as <i>Peril at King\u2019s Landing</i>, or she might spin out a story of her own. It\u2019s a big responsibility being the Narrator, but it\u2019s also the most rewarding one of all.<br/><br/><b>The Game</b><br/><br/>Whether you are a player or a Narrator, everyone uses the same rules in SIFRP. Game rules are an important part of any roleplaying game because they help define what is possible and impossible. They ensure a certain level of fairness that comes from a shared understanding of how things work. Also, they help guide a player and Narrator in making decisions about the characters they portray by presenting meaningful numbers that reveal vital components about a character, such as his ability with social interaction, how well she swings a sword, or how big or small, weak or strong, beautiful or hideous the character is.<br/><br/>But, to cite a clich\xe9, rules are meant to be broken. Unlike other games, roleplaying games are famous for being fluid when it comes to rules, and if a certain rule doesn\u2019t fit with a group, it\u2019s not just okay to dump it, it\u2019s expected! Use the rules in this book to support the stories you tell, not to define them.<br/><br/><b>The Game System</b><br/><br/>Since rules support the stories you and your friends will tell, you may find there are long stretches when you don\u2019t have to rely on the rules at all, when the interaction of your characters and the dialogue generated between you carries the game without needing dice or flipping through the book. Other times, however, the rules may figure in the game a great deal more than you would expect, especially in combat, tricky negotiations, and other instances of drama that can have serious consequences if the characters fail.<br/><br/>Drama is the key when it comes to the game mechanics. Whenever a player character or the Narrator attempts to do something in which failure has consequences or the outcome is not certain, the rules come into play in the form of a test. A test is simply rolling the dice, adding them up, and comparing them to a number called a Difficulty. If the sum of the dice equals or beats the challenge, the test succeeds. If the sum of the dice is lower than the challenge, the test fails.<br/><br/><b>--- A Song of Ice and Fire Roleplaying (2009)</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388523/#Comment_388523" name="Item_119" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-28T03:26:51+00:00" title="August 28, 2012  3:26AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In a <i>roleplaying game</i>, you and other players take the roles of characters in an adventure story. One of the players, called the <i>Narrator</i>, takes on the job of starting the story and telling you about the situations your characters find<br/>themselves in. The players decide what their characters do, and the game rules determine how successful they are. The Narrator then moves the story along by describing what happens next, and so forth. As the game unfolds, you detail an entire story involving your characters, like the chapters of a novel or the episodes of a television series. Roleplaying games are unique in that no one player \u201cwins\u201d the game, since the goal is for everybody to have fun creating the story. A roleplaying game also has no predetermined ending; play can continue for as long as you and the other players wish, and your story can stretch over many different play sessions, just as a novel does over many chapters, and even many books<br/>in an ongoing series.<br/><b><br/>--- A Song of Ice and Fire Roleplaying Quick-Start Rules (2008)</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388525">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388525/#Comment_388525" name="Item_120" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-28T03:33:52+00:00" title="August 28, 2012  3:33AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            THE BASICS OF THE GAME<br/>Read this section carefully!

The players create hero characters who compete with each other to prove who is greatest. The Antagonist creates adversity to throw at the heroes to give them a chance to strive and prove their mettle. This is not a game of \u201cplayers vs. Antagonist,\u201d though it may seem that way at first glance. Instead, the players compete against each other, with the Antagonist as equal opposition to all\u2014the level playing field upon which the heroes compete.<br/><br/><b>Basic Game Philosophy</b><br/><br/>The core idea behind the Agon game system is that anything of value in the game must be won in a contest: goals are set, dice are rolled, and the final outcome is decided. Through this series of goals and contests, the heroes gain glory and add to their legends.<br/><br/>The winner of a contest is always rewarded. There is no prize for second place. In Agon, winning contests and gaining glory is the whole point of play.<br/><b><br/>What the Players Do</b><br/><br/>The players try to gain as much glory for their heroes as possible before the heroes meet their fates and retire from play. Glory is gained through victory in battle and by winning contests. Players also need to work together to complete quests given to the heroes by the gods. By finishing quests, players earn some glory for their heroes and\u2014if they complete enough quests\u2014earn the right to create a more powerful hero after the current one retires.<br/><br/>Players are competing against each other for glory. The hero who earns the most glory will have the greatest legend told about him or her, which is how you win the game. See Advancement, page 66.<br/><b><br/>What the Antagonist Does</b><br/><br/>The Antagonist creates the battles and contests that the heroes will face. To do this, the Antagonist creates a world filled with conflict and strife for the heroes to explore and engage. The Antagonist creates beasts, monsters, and men to challenge the heroes and thwart their goals. By establishing tough opposition to the goals of the heroes, the Antagonist provides the adversity needed for the heroes to demonstrate their prowess and earn glory for themselves.<br/><br/><b>--- Agon (2006)</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388527/#Comment_388527" name="Item_122" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-28T03:39:19+00:00" title="August 28, 2012  3:39AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Ashen Stars</i> is a roleplaying game, in which a Game Moderator (GM) and a group of players get together to spontaneously weave an ongoing storyline.

Children play role playing games all the time<br/>without even thinking about it.<br/><br/>Any game where you pretend to be someone<br/>else is an exercise in role playing. In Cops &amp; Robbers,<br/>everyone has a part to play: the heroic police or the<br/>greedy criminals. It doesn\u2019t really matter whether the<br/>cops or the robbers win\u2014long as the players all have<br/>fun. A tabletop role playing game, like this one, ain\u2019t<br/>much different. It\u2019s just got a bit more structure, and<br/>more focus on the story. Playing Cops &amp; Robbers, you<br/>might argue over whether a gunshot was a hit or miss,<br/>and rarely does an overarching tale unfold.

You could be a<br/>rising-star politician, a cocky fighter pilot, a triggerhappy<br/>marine, an ace mechanic, or just about anyone<br/>else that fits in the framework of the story.<br/><br/>One player has a slightly different role: the Game<br/>Master (GM). He sets the stage, interprets the rules,<br/>and portrays all of the supporting<br/>characters in the BSG universe. The job,<br/>and the rewards, are a bit bigger for the GM, but<br/>that don\u2019t make the other players less important.<br/>If you\u2019re a nugget, fresh to role playing games,<br/>and don\u2019t have an experienced player around, take<br/>a moment and visit www.bsg-rpg.com if you are<br/>looking for some help. There you can find the Battlestar<br/>Galactica RPG Quickstart Guide. It has simplified rules,<br/>pre-made characters, and a short scenario designed<br/>to teach new players the basics.

The whole<br/>time, you\u2019re thinking: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t walk down those<br/>creepy stairs to the dark basement, especially without a<br/>fl ashlight. I\u2019d do X, Y, or Z instead!\u201d Since you\u2019re in the<br/>passenger\u2019s seat for the plot you\u2019re reading or watching,<br/>however, you simply have to sit back and let it unfold.<br/><br/>What if you could take hold of the driver\u2019s seat?<br/>What if you could take the plot in the direction you\u2019d<br/>choose? That is the essence of a roleplaying game.<br/><br/>A roleplaying game (or RPG, for short) is part improvisational<br/>theater, part storytelling, and part game.<br/>A single person (the gamemaster) runs the game for<br/>a group of players that pretend to be characters in a<br/>fictitious world. The world could be a mystery game<br/>set in the 1920s that takes you adventuring around<br/>the globe, a fantasy realm inhabited by dragons<br/>and trolls and sword-wielding barbarians, or a science<br/>fiction setting with aliens and spaceship and<br/>world-crushing weaponry. The players pick a setting<br/>that they find cool and want to play in. The players<br/>then craft their own characters, providing a detailed<br/>history and personality to bring each to life. These<br/>characters have a set of statistics (numerical values)<br/>that represent skills, attributes, and other abilities.<br/>The gamemaster then explains the situation in which<br/>the characters find themselves. The players, through<br/>their characters, interact with the storyline and each<br/>others\u2019 characters, acting out the plot. As the players<br/>roleplay through some scenarios, the gamemaster will<br/>probably ask a given player to roll some dice and the<br/>resulting numbers will determine the success or failure<br/>of a character\u2019s attempted action. The gamemaster<br/>uses the rules of the game to interpret the dice rolls<br/>and the outcome of the character\u2019s actions.<br/><br/>As a group exercise, the players control the storyline<br/>(the adventure), which evolves much like any movie or<br/>book but within the flexible plot created by the gamemaster.<br/>This gamemaster plot provides a framework<br/>and ideas for potential courses of action and outcomes,<br/>but it is simply an outline of what might happen\u2014it<br/>is not concrete until the players become involved.

As a<br/>group, the players tell stories about their characters. Whenever<br/>those characters take risky actions, the players roll dice to<br/>determine the outcome. The higher you roll, the better.<br/><br/>In Houses of the Blooded, you play the role of a character in<br/>an ongoing story. You define your character with traits listed<br/>on a character sheet. Together with your friends, you sit down<br/>with other players and make your characters together, relying<br/>on each other to assist in that process. This game calls those<br/>characters player characters because they are characters<br/>controlled by the players.<br/><br/>One player takes on a special role. She doesn\u2019t make a character<br/>of her own, but instead, plays all the characters in the story you<br/>and your other friends don\u2019t play: the servants, enemies, rivals,<br/>and allies of your player characters (or PCs). Most games call her<br/>either the Game Master or the Dungeon Master. In this game, we<br/>call that player the Narrator because that better fits her role in<br/>the game.<br/><br/>Like I said, the Narrator plays all the secondary parts in the story<br/>you and your friends will tell together. She also narrates details of<br/>the scenes to the other players, serving as kind of a storyteller<br/>and referee all rolled up into one.

What do you do?<br/>That\u2019s role-playing. \u201cYou\u2019re pretending to be this guy, and stuff is happening to that guy. What do you do?\u201d<br/><br/>Beyond that, role-playing is also a game. There are winners and there are losers. In fact, because RPGs are an interactive and cooperative social experience, it is often possible that everyone wins or everyone loses a particular game. When you become a character, you don\u2019t know whether you are destined for great things, or fated to suffer an ignoble and useless death. You are not living the life of a storybook hero, you are exploring a fantasy world as if it were real. And fantasy worlds are dangerous!<br/><br/>However, winning and losing in the end is not as important as playing the game itself. Was the game interesting? Was it exciting? If it was, then it really doesn\u2019t matter if your character failed to reach his goals, or failed to survive at all. If not, then does it really matter if the character defeated many monsters and gathered a lot of treasure? No. In fact, sometimes losing is more interesting and exciting than winning.<br/><br/>Traditional role-playing games, such as LotFP Weird Fantasy Role-Playing, use rulebooks and dice to determine the outcomes of actions within the game. The game is typically played with all the participants around a table, with one<br/>player, called the Referee, moderating the in-game situations and enforcing the rules of the game.<br/><br/>Does this sound complicated? Perhaps it is, a little. This game creates a structure for you to imagine unlimited adventure and intrigue within an infinite number of possible worlds, after all. But learning a roleplaying game is no more complicated or time-consuming than reading a book. Even children have gotten through these concepts and learned these games on<br/>their own. Jump in and don\u2019t be afraid to make mistakes \u2013 that will happen regardless \u2013 and you\u2019ll be fine.<br/><br/><b>--- Lamentations of the Flame Princess Grindhouse Edition Tutorial Book (2011)</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388544">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388544/#Comment_388544" name="Item_132" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-28T05:11:22+00:00" title="August 28, 2012  5:11AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mars Colony is designed for two players.

The<br/>GM describes the scene for the other players and adjudicates<br/>the results of their actions, often by throwing some dice1.<br/>So, it goes something like this:<br/><br/><b>Player:</b> I open the door into the next room.<br/><b>GM:</b> You see an orc armed with a battleaxe guarding a chest.<br/><b>Player:</b> I enter into a frank and meaningful dialogue with<br/>the orc, validating his right to guard chests but not pigeonholing<br/>him into a stereotype, in the hopes of restructuring<br/>the traditional adventurer/monster antagonistic relationship<br/>into something more positive and mutually beneficial.<br/><b>GM:</b> Roll 1d20 against your Charisma skill.<br/><b>Player:</b> I succeed.<br/><b>GM:</b> The orc is moved by your rhetoric.

Players assume the roles of characters (referred to as player characters or PCs) who are the protagonists of the play. In some regards, a role-playing game is like Radio Theater in that the story is told verbally and not physically acted out.<br/><br/>Players are the actors and actresses of Aletheia. They are the ones who bring its stories to life. Their characters are the principals of the drama. The players decide who their characters are, what they look like, what they do, and how they act; they fuel the dynamic that drives the game via the actions of their characters.<br/><br/>Being a player is more than being an actor because there is no script. In a play, the script tells the actor what to do. In contrast, a role-playing game is wholly freeform and improvisational. The player must decide what the character does and says.<br/><br/>In a role-playing game, one participant assumes the role of Gamemaster (GM). He or she acts as the director, establishing the setting, plot, and mood. The Gamemaster must set the stage for the story being told, creating the framework in which the players act. It is the GM\u2019s responsibility to relate the environment to the players; the GM is their eyes and ears, describing the world of Aletheia to the players. The Gamemaster also assumes the roles of all the characters with which the players interact outside their group. These GM controlled characters are known as non-player characters (NPCs). While the GM must create the initial framework of the story, the players will determine the ultimate direction of the plot.<br/><br/>In addition to helping the player characters interact with their environment, the GM also acts as referee. The GM must interpret the rules of the game in a fair and impartial manner to facilitate play. Thus, the Gamemaster should be familiar with the rules beforehand so that informed rulings can be made.<br/><br/><b>--- Aletheia (2007)</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388555">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388555/#Comment_388555" name="Item_140" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-28T06:03:56+00:00" title="August 28, 2012  6:03AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Alpha Omega</i> is a role-playing game\u2014a collaborative storytelling<br/>game in which players assume the roles of central characters in a story led by<br/>the Game Moderator (GM). <i>Alpha Omega</i> is best played by two to six players, with<br/>one acting as the GM to direct the action.<br/><br/>The GM is responsible for creating\u2014or at least overseeing\u2014the story, describing<br/>the world and the action as it unfolds around the players.

They take the roles of the principal characters in an exciting adventure story, pretending to be those characters just as an actor pretends to be the person he or she plays in a movie. Unlike a movie, though, the actions of the characters are not acted out. Rather, the action is imagined by the players and described to the other participants. You don't actually pretend to shoot a gun at someone, for example. You describe that action, saying something to the effect of "my character opens fire on the enemy."<br/><br/>Role-playing games have rules that dictate what the character can and cannot do. Every character in the game is defined by a set of statistics and numbers that ordain how talented he or she is at any given action. Rules mechanics then help determine whether an action was successful.<br/><br/>[...]<br/><br/>The GM's job is to act as rules arbiter and describe the action to the players. He or she also handles playing other characters in the game \u2013 usually the antagonists, but sometimes friends of the players' characters \u2013\xa0and sets the environment in which the characters exist.<br/><br/>The object of a role-playing game is not to defeat the other players as you would in a game of cards or a board game, though. Instead, you are working to collectively tell a story about the principal characters of the game.<br/><br/>[...]<br/><br/>Role-playing games are typically played for about two to six hours \u2013\xa0about the time it takes to sit down with friends to play for an evening.<br/><br/>[...]<br/><br/>Role-playing games are tools for your imagination. They are designed to let you play out exciting stories of interest to you and your friends, and they provide structure and rules so that there are fewer conflicts and a framework within which to place the action of those stories.<br/><br/><b>\u2013 Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai (2000)</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P

You and some others would sit in a circle and one of you would start off with the first word of a sentence. The next child around the circle would add the second word and the one after the third. By every child adding a word, the group would soon complete the sentence, and then another sentence, and then a paragraph. If you played for long enough, eventually you would complete an entire story all together as a group. That\u2019s one of the most basic story games.<br/><br/>This is like that. However, instead of adding a single word, each player narrates what happens in an entire scene. Other players can help by posing questions, adding new ideas, or providing the voice of the characters who appear as the story develops. In <i>Anarktica</i>, the primary means by which other players help is through using what we call ritual phrases. There\u2019s a section on these later on. Also, there are some special characters \u2013 called the Heroes and the Adversary \u2013 who are owned and voiced by a single player. They are the central characters of the story of <i>Anarktica</i>.<br/><b>--- Anarktica (2012)</b><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388963">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388963/#Comment_388963" name="Item_152" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-31T16:09:32+00:00" title="August 31, 2012  4:09PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a spoken medium; the group creates a fiction through organized dialogue and shared imagination.

The nature of the adventure is set by a referee, called the Game Master (GM, for short). The GM determines the background and plays the part of the other people the characters meet during the adventure.<br/><br/>No gameboard is necessary for a roleplaying game (though some systems, including GURPS, include optional "boardgame" rules for combat situations). Instead, the game is played <i>verbally</i>. The GM describes the situation, and tells the players what their characters see and hear. The players then describe what they are doing to meet the challenge. The GM describes the results of these actions... and so on. Depending on the situation, the GM may determine what happens arbitrarily (for the best possible story), or by referring to specific game rules (to determine what is realistically possible), or by rolling dice (to give an interesting random result).<br/><br/>Part of the object of a roleplaying game is to have each player meet the situation as the <i>character</i> would. A roleplaying game can let a player take the part of a stern Japanese samurai, a medieval jester, a wise priest, a stowaway gutter kid on her first star-trip... or absolutely anyone else. In a given situation, all those characters would react differently. And that's what roleplaying is about!<br/><br/>Thus, good roleplaying teaches cooperation among the players, and broadens their viewpoints. But it's not purely educational. It's also one of the most creative possible entertainments. The major difference between roleplaying and other types of entertainment is this: Most entertainment is passive. The audience just sits and watches, without taking part in the creative process.<br/><br/>But in roleplaying, the "audience" joins in the creation. While the GM is the chief storyteller, the players are responsible for creating their own characters. And if they want something to happen in the story, they <i>make</i> it happen, because they're in the story.<br/><br/>So, while other types of media are mass-produced to please the widest possible audience, each roleplaying adventure is an individual gem, crafted by the people who take part in it. The GM (or the original adventure author) provides the raw material... but the final polish comes from the players themselves.<br/><br/>The other important thing about roleplaying is this: It doesn't have to be competitive. In most roleplaying situations, the party will succeed or fail as a group, depending on how well they cooperate. And, just as in real life, the most important rewards of good roleplaying come in <i>character development</i>. The more successfully a player portrays his character (as judged by the GM) the more that character will gain in ability.<br/><br/>A roleplaying adventure may have a fixed objective... save the Princess, find the treasure, stop the invasion. Or it may be open-ended, as the characters move from one escapade to the next. It's all up to the GM and the players. A roleplaying "campaign" can be open-ended, lasting for years, as characters (and players) come and go.<br/><br/>When it's all said and done, the GM and the players will have created a story... the story of how the characters met, learned to work together, encountered a challenge, and (we hope) triumphed!<br/><br/><b>--- GURPS Basic Set, Third Edition (1991)</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388977">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner" title="Evan_Torner"><img alt="Evan_Torner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/278/nHOYP3VNJB6A6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner">Evan_Torner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388977/#Comment_388977" name="Item_154" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-31T21:44:49+00:00" title="August 31, 2012  9:44PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>The Game</b><br/><br/>The novice gamer should think of the game as a combination of things.

The aim is to score runs by hitting a thrown ball with a bat and touching a series of four bases arranged at the corners of a ninety-foot diamond. Players on the batting team take turns hitting against the pitcher of the fielding team, which tries to stop them from scoring runs by getting hitters out in any of several ways. A player on the batting team can stop at any of the bases and later advance via a teammate's hit or other means. The teams switch between batting and fielding whenever the fielding team records three outs. One turn at bat for each team constitutes an inning and nine innings make up a professional game. The team with the most runs at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>(Bat-and-ball games (or safe haven games to avoid confusion with the club games like golf and hockey) are field games played by two opposing teams. The teams alternate between "batting" roles, sometimes called "in at bat" and "out in the field", or simply in and out. The fielding team defends, so only the batting team may score, but they have equal chances in both roles. The game is counted rather than timed.)<br/><br/>American football, known in the United States (but almost nowhere else in the world) simply as football, is a sport played between two teams of eleven with the objective of scoring points by advancing the ball into the opposing team's end zone by running with it or throwing it to a teammate. Points can be scored by carrying the ball over the opponent's goal line, catching a pass thrown over that goal line, kicking the ball through the opponent's goal posts or tackling an opposing ball carrier in his own end zone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389213">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso" title="MikeRiverso"><img alt="MikeRiverso" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/825/n647RY8THQBOA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso">MikeRiverso</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389213/#Comment_389213" name="Item_159" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-04T15:01:34+00:00" title="September  4, 2012  3:01PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, just for fun, I copy-and-pasted the entire text of this thread into a wordle: <br/><br/><a href="http://www.wordle.net/show/wrdl/5646399/What_is_a_Roleplaying_Game%3F" rel="nofollow">What is a Roleplaying Game?</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389629">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner" title="Evan_Torner"><img alt="Evan_Torner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/278/nHOYP3VNJB6A6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner">Evan_Torner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389629/#Comment_389629" name="Item_160" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-08T11:51:15+00:00" title="September  8, 2012 11:51AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>What is a Roleplaying Game?</b><br/><br/>For many people, a role-playing game (RPG) is the "mature" version of the games we used to play as children: "House," "Cops and Robbers," and "Superheroes." A rule system assists in settling conflicts and resolving actions, often with the use of a random generator (dice, cards, etc.) to add an unpredictable element to the game. A game requires a handful of players and one person to act as the Game Master (GM) or referee. The players tell the GM what their anime alter-egos would like to do, and the GM describes the results of their actions. The GM is also responsible for creating the plot and the setting for the game adventures and works closely with the players to keep the game interesting and fun for all.<br/><br/>In <i>Big Eyes, Small Mouth (BESM)</i>, players assume the role of an anime character suitable to the time period and setting of the adventure the GM will be using. The game system helps players assign some strengths and weaknesses to their characters using numbers to indicate relative ability. The remaining elements of a character's backround, family, knowledge, hobbies and interests are not covered by the rules and are described by each player according to his or her choice of character personality.<br/><br/>As a player, you control your character's actions in the game. He or she can be likened to one of the major characters in an anime movie, working through the unexpected twists and turns of the plot with the help of other major characters. Your character's actions can greatly affect the outcome of the adventure, but you must keep in mind that every action has a consequence that could return to haunt your character in a future session. Role-playing is a group effort, however, and positive interactions between your character and those of the other players are vital to everyone's enjoyment of the game.<br/><br/>As a GM, your contribution will be much greater than that from any one player. You must establish the genre, setting, conflicts, and plot of the adventure as well as all the non-player characters (NPCs) your group of players will meet during the game. NPCs are similar to the background characters in a movie \u2013 few are given quality screen time with the major characters unless they are good buddies, or central to the plot. Additionally, you must be able to project your imagination to the players by describing in vivid detail the world in which they live. Then, after all that, your game plot must remain sufficiently flexible to allow the characters' actions to make a definite impact on the adventure. A plot that is too rigid may leave players feeling their characters have lost the free will to affect their own destiny. Should you assume the role of GM, you must possess creativity, good judgment and the ability to improvise in unexpected situations. It takes extra time and effort, but the reward of a well-played adventure can be almost euphoric.<br/><br/>Each role-playing adventure or episode will require one or two sessions, each several hours in length. A number of episodes using the same characters can be linked together to form an anime campaign. Campaigns require more commitment from everyone involved, but watching the characters grow as the greater plot unfolds makes the extra effort worthwhile. The most engaging campaigns can last upwards of 5-10 years, but keeping a campaign running for 8 months to a few years is considered tremendously successful.<br/><br/><b>\u2013Big Eyes, Small Mouth (2000)</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389701/#Comment_389701" name="Item_161" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-09T15:05:51+00:00" title="September  9, 2012  3:05PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 10, 2012 12:41AM by John_Harper.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>GANGBUSTERS</b> is a role playing game, an advanced form <br/>of "make believe." In a typical game, two to eight players will be <br/>seated around a large table. They will be acting out the adven- <br/>tures of important people in the city; one player might be a <br/>prohibiton agent, another may be a newspaper reporter and a <br/>third could be a private investigator. Other players might be the <br/>city police chief, a detective and a gangster.<br/><br/>Now suppose the gangster player has just robbed a small hard- <br/>ware store. The police chief and his detective must try to arrest <br/>the gangster. The police chief knows the gangster also runs a <br/>bootlegging business, so he calls the prohibition agent to setup <br/>a raid on the gang's breweries. In the meantime, the newspaper <br/>reporter is trying to find out why the gangster would rob a small <br/>hardware store and the private investigator has been hired by <br/>the store's owner to recover the stolen property. <br/><br/>The people these players are pretending to be are called player <br/>characters (abbreviated PCs). From time to time these player <br/>characters will need to meet and talk to other people in the city, <br/>people who aren't being played by any player. These other peo- <br/>ple are called non-player characters (abbreviated NPCs). In <br/>games involving many non-player characters, one player takes <br/>on the special role of a judge. The judge of a game serves as a <br/>referee. He helps keep the action moving and plays the parts of <br/>all the NPCs the player characters meet. The functions of a <br/>judge for a GANGBUSTERS game are explained later in this <br/>rule book. <b>You do not need a judge in order to play. Many <br/>exciting games can be played without a judge.</b><br/><br/>If you play the game without a judge, you should not try to do <br/>anything that is not specifically described in these rules. Unu- <br/>sual things can be tried in games with a judge, since the judge <br/>can decide the effects of special actions. <br/><br/><b>- Gangbusters (TSR 1982)</b>, emphasis mine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389702/#Comment_389702" name="Item_162" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-09T15:09:36+00:00" title="September  9, 2012  3:09PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Holy crap y'all, check out that Gangbusters text!<br/><br/>The PCs, all set up at cross-purposes, pursuing their own interests, with no GM. 1982.

Th e players control the main characters of the story. The gamemaster directs the action of the story and controls the opposition (known as non-player characters, or NPCs), the props, the setting, and everything else the player characters may encounter. Players and gamemasters must work together to build an intense and interesting adventure. As a player, you control a player character (PC). During the course of the game, the gamemaster (GM) will describe events or situations to you. The plot given by the game master must, as a consequence, be flexible, as the players can freely choose where their characters will go, with whom they will speak, and how they will act. As you roleplay through some situations, the gamemaster will probably ask you to roll some dice, and the resulting numbers will represent your character\u2019s attempted action. Th e gamemaster uses the rules of the game to interpret the dice rolls and the outcome of your character\u2019s action.<br/><br/>The world of Degenesis is your world; you create the characters who inhabit it. Using your imagination and the rules system, you guide your characters through the intrigues of the various post-apocalyptic cults and have a hand in shaping the<br/>mythologies of the surviving cultures.<br/><br/>--- <b>Degenesis (English translation), 2012</b> (originally published in German, 2004).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_390010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390010/#Comment_390010" name="Item_171" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-13T07:20:55+00:00" title="September 13, 2012  7:20AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had no idea there was thiss much Gangbusters love around these parts.

Like many games, it has rules, components, and dice to help describe and resolve the action. Unlike most games, an RPG has no winner or loser and no opposing teams. If everyone has fun, then everyone wins!<br/><br/>The Game Master, or the GM, serves as the judge and the storyteller. It\u2019s his or her responsibility to present an exciting and compelling situation to the other players, and to help determine what happens next when those players respond to that situation. The GM also takes on the role of every character in the galaxy not controlled by another player. Characters controlled by the GM are called Non-Player Characters, or NPCs. GMs can invent their own stories and adventures, or use adventures written by somebody else, like the adventure included in the Star Wars: Edge of the Empire Beginner Game.<br/><br/>The other 2-4 players take on the role of individual characters in the Star Wars galaxy. There are four pre-generated hero characters included in the Star Wars: Edge of the Empire Beginner Game. If you are a hero player choose one of the character folios and keep it in front of you; It will explain the character you\u2019ve chosen to play and give you a lot of information about how to play the game. Over the course of the game you will choose what your hero does and says, and use the dice and game rules to determine whether you succeed or fail. Characters controlled by hero players are called Player Characters, or PCs.<br/><br/>-<b><i>Star Wars: Edge of the Empire</i> Beginner Game</b> (beta, presumably - from here: <a href="http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite_sec.asp?eidm=224&amp;esem=1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite_sec.asp?eidm=224&amp;esem=1</a>)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_390816">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390816/#Comment_390816" name="Item_173" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-19T13:17:42+00:00" title="September 19, 2012  1:17PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Traveller</b> is basically a conversation game\u2026 [It] is designed for mature people who have imagination and an interest in the world's science fiction. Traditionally, a more experienced person serves as the game referee and controls the action of the scenario. Since the referee usually needs to make some preparations before the current game begins, he or she is responsible for being read and knowing the rules that will apply\u2026<br/><br/><b>Playing the Game</b><br/><br/>There are three basic ways to play <b>Traveller</b>: solitaire, scenario and campaign. Any of these may be unsupervised (that is, without a referee; the players themselves administer the rules and manipulate the situation). Recommended instead is a the refereed game, where a separate player runs the situation and administers the rules.<br/><br/><b>The Solitaire Game</b>: One player undertakes some journey or adventure alone. He or she handles the effects of the rules as the situation progresses. Solitaire is ideal for players who are isolated by situation or geography.<br/><br/>In addition, there are many aspects ideally suited to solitaire consideration. A single player can spend the time generating characters, designing starships, generating worlds and subsectors, planning situations, and mapping out ideas to use in later group adventures.<br/><br/><b>The Scenario</b>: Several players embark on a journey or adventure together. The scenario resembles a science-fiction novel, in that some basic goal or purpose is stated, and the adventure occurs as the group strives to achieve the goal. Usually, the scenario is a one-time affair and ends when the evening is over of the goal is reached.<br/><br/>An example of a simple scenario might proceed like this: players generate characters (Book 1) and then look for a patron (Book 3). When they find one, he suggests an expedition to a world orbiting Sirius, a world reputed to be the source of "diamonds as big as your fist".<br/><br/>In most cases, the scenario is intended to be a one-time affair, with the characters and situation to be discarded at the adventure's end. Strangely enough, players generally become attached to their characters and usually want to continue their lives in further adventures. To this purpose, the campaign is designed.<br/><br/><b>The Campaign</b>: Several players manipulate their characters in a series of continuing, linked adventures in a consistent universe. The referee is responsible for generating the basic facts of the universe before play begins. As the campaign unfolds, the players may range far and wide through the universe, perhaps beyond the referees original boundaries. In such cases, the campaign may be temporarily halted as the referee expands the available data (or the referee may be forced to work through the night getting ready for the next day's adventures). Where the scenario is like a science-fiction novel, the campaign is like a continuing series.<br/><br/>- <b><i>Traveller, Book 1: Characters and Combat</i> (1977)</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390821">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner" title="Evan_Torner"><img alt="Evan_Torner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/278/nHOYP3VNJB6A6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner">Evan_Torner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390821/#Comment_390821" name="Item_174" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-19T14:17:11+00:00" title="September 19, 2012  2:17PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good find, <a href="/forums/profile/Wordman">@Wordman</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421952">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gordon" title="Gordon"><img alt="Gordon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gordon">Gordon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421952/#Comment_421952" name="Item_175" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-25T14:08:48+00:00" title="September 25, 2013  2:08PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            IN THE LABYRINTH is a fantasy game. It allows any number of players, refereed by a Game Master, to enter the world of Cidri - a world where swords and sorcery meet fragments of super-science, where medieval knights battle monsters to save fair maidens, and wizards labor in their towers to cast ever-more-powerful spells. Each player becomes an adventurer, traveling with his companions to deserted cities and beasthaunted tunnels, braving dangers to win loot and glory.  IN THE LABYRINTH allows you to play out the worlds of heroic fantasy \u2014 and live them for yourself.<br/><br/>IN THE LABYRINTH is a "role-playing" game. The players do not just move counters on the board. Each figure in the game is a "character" \u2014 an individual person (or elf or dwarf or halfling or orc . . . ) with his own likes, dislikes, special talents and abilities, magical spells, possessions and desires. Each player creates a character \u2014 whatever type he wishes. Then the player becomes that character, striving to survive dangers and gain experience. Successful characters will be able to increase their abilities, becoming more renowned fighters or more powerful wizards; unsuccessful ones will die and be removed from the game, leaving the player to start over with new figures. The essence of a role-playing game is the new persona the player takes on; the interactions between the characters and the Game Master make every game different and exciting.<br/><br/>The key to the game is the Game Master, or GM. The GM sets up the labyrinth which the characters will explore. He may even create an entire outside world for them to travel through! The GM referees the game, taking the part of Fate and the Gods. He (or an assistant) also plays the monsters, beasts, and other wanderers that the players will encounter. The Game Master is the final arbiter; he should strive to befair, but his word is law. It is his task to keep balance in the game and to see that the players have a fair chance \u2014 and enjoy themselves!<br/><br/>IN THE LABYRINTH may be played two ways. It is possible for a GM to design a small tunnel complex in a couple of hours; then, the players sit down, develop new characters, and begin play. At the end of the evening, the survivors with the most loot and experience are the winners.<br/><br/>More challenging is the "campaign game." In such a game, the GM is likely to spend much more time to create a detailed world. There may be dozens of players, not all of whom will be active at any given time. Play is not terminated after one session; rather, the game goes on indefinitely. Months and years pass in the fantasy world at a rate chosen by the players, while characters adventure, gain experience, age, make alliances, work at their jobs, intrigue against one another . . . whatever the players want. Labyrinth adventures are conducted at intervals by the GM, and the players spend the interim planning and negotiating. Several GMs (some of whom may also be players) can co-operate on a large campaign.<br/><br/>IN THE LABYRINTH, Gamemasters' Campaign And Adventure Guide, for The Fantasy Trip, 1980                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421954">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gordon" title="Gordon"><img alt="Gordon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gordon">Gordon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421954/#Comment_421954" name="Item_176" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-25T14:10:23+00:00" title="September 25, 2013  2:10PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The "may be played two ways" bit was why I thought this was worth posting here, but I guess "What is roleplaying" actually ends the paragraph before.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421967">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421967/#Comment_421967" name="Item_177" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-25T15:03:21+00:00" title="September 25, 2013  3:03PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For those not following my google+ thingy, here is the link to the first 40-ish What is a Roleplaying Game hierarchal cluster analysis from some text mining I did.<br/><br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BzWb0o2WBA-ASllOZVJDZDkwWGM/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BzWb0o2WBA-ASllOZVJDZDkwWGM/edit?usp=sharing</a><br/><br/>Some interesting patterns show up in how texts talk to us about what an RPG is.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421969">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421969/#Comment_421969" name="Item_178" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-25T15:09:37+00:00" title="September 25, 2013  3:09PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>For those not following my google+ thingy, here is the link to the first 40-ish What is a Roleplaying Game hierarchal cluster analysis from some text mining I did.<br/><br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BzWb0o2WBA-ASllOZVJDZDkwWGM/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BzWb0o2WBA-ASllOZVJDZDkwWGM/edit?usp=sharing</a><br/><br/>Some interesting patterns show up in how texts talk to us about what an RPG is.<br/></blockquote>\nWhat does this mean?
