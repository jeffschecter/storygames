Now all of the races of man: Dvegr, Humans, Sidda, Sidhain, and Fane-created Fomoradgh must stand together or fall before them and become their slaves once again.<br/><br/>High Valor takes fantasy gaming along familiar paths but trods in different boots. Glory in battle and die for your cause. Face down evil and kindle a light in the onrushing dark. Brutal battles come. You with your allies may be all that can shift the tide.<br/><br/>Rhyme your spell words and sing songs of magic; humble yourself before the High Lord and in the Martyr's name to gird your people against monsters; take the sword and fight. Rely on will, faith and valor as you risk damnation, death, and terrible ends for the needs of others.<br/><br/>The Long Night comes. The Fane-Lord armies sweep across the land, and the Free Kingdoms will be plunged into darkness.<br/><br/>Where will you make your stand?<br/><br/>Currently in PDF Print Coming Soon:<br/><a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=82385" rel="nofollow">High Valor</a><br/><br/><a href="http://silverlionstudios.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/High-Valor-Preview.pdf" rel="nofollow">Preview</a><br/><br/><br/><a href="http://chaosgrenade.gamesandgear.net/?p=1095&amp;cpage=1#comment-239" rel="nofollow">Review</a><br/><br/><br/>I may not be quite as "Story game" oriented. High Valor is something more traditional than some, less than others. It uses mechanics (like dice lending) that are framed into game aspects that come up in play through the characters ability to influence the world. Not the players. Dice lending specifically allows a player to lend dice to an ally by saying a prayer or giving a pep talk.It might be worth looking into if you like traditional games some, but want something with a few unique but simple ways to play out "vanilla" fantasy set in the late Dark Ages/Early Middle Ages. I fully believe in genre mechanics that put play power in the characters abilities, but keeping it tied to the player's choices of role-playing actions.<br/><br/>Take a look.

How about from a short campaign:<br/><br/>Brother Aethric:<br/>Raised by priest along with several other orphans, Brother Aethric followed into his "fathers" footsteps by becoming a deeply religious man.<br/>Though he is youthful and driven to fight the dark things he is still a priest and knight under the Church of the Martyr. <br/><br/>Returned from years of training to the home temple of his father and home village. He was resting in the inn with the innkeeps permission and rooms being made up for his brothers and sisters, offered for free by the innkeeper<br/>to the children raised in the temple.  It was just in time to gather with his friends before things went awry. A woman in a veil appeared with arms-man, and demanded the rooms the inn master had laid aside for them, Refusing<br/>to acquiesce to her demands she used some magic at her command to try and manipulate him.. Seeing the disturbance Aethric called upon the Martyr and Highlord to banish the vile manipulation and manage to drive the magic back<br/>from the room. It made the woman very unhappy.<br/><br/>Finally gathering with his father and brothers and sisters, his father told them of dreams and gave them each a token--their meanings unknown. They had all too brief a moment of reunion and love<br/>and laughter before monstrous humanoids who were withered and ghul-like appeared and tried to siege the town. Fighting them off the brothers, paused but a moment and the dragon, Hunger,<br/> sprang forth unleashing its locust breath on the village and its grape crops. They seeing no way to stop it--even prayer seemed weak against the dragon, guided the townsfolk to the stone walled church--hoping<br/>it would stand longer than the wooden building against the dragon. The village folk huddled near and heads were counted when Brother Aethric realized their father remained outside. He could only listen from behind the sealed church door as his father stood ground against the dragon. He struggled with other to try to leave the building but was held back by the less suicidal of his family. The sound at last subsided and he rushed outside to find his father dying. The strain too much upon his heart of standing firm in faith against the dragon's deadly might. He had only a few hours of weeping before the demands of the duke were made clear: The veiled woman would lead them and deal with refugees in the north along the coast, in an attempt to see if they were the sourced of the dragon being stirred up and assaulting the village. Their dictates were clear, deal with the refugees from elsewhere, and stop the dragon.<br/><br/>Aethric and the veiled woman battled will to will for the whole journey finally arriving at an abandoned mine system and facing the refugees, who had been driven here by raiders, and had nothing to do with the dragon. Given her orders the woman was ready to drive them off--but the kindness of the Church raised orphans rejected her idea, and offered other options--work a deal to train them to fight, help them get tools and eventually land, if they'd help slay the dragon. The story continues with monsters, strange Sidda, and their eternal love, and the dragon attacking and killing many before a lucky blow by the Dvegr Runesmith with his axe took the dragon out. Yet the dragon cursed them all with its dying words..<br/><br/>(This was a PC I played, and so the few anachronism come from the GM's version of the world. I tend to let things slide, because its hard to convey a true Dark Ages world, with all the fantastic that can change it anyway.)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kinship: Human<br/>Will 2  Faith: 3 Valor: 3<br/><br/>Profession: Ruteritten (Knight of the Rod)<br/><br/>Ruterritten- Lesser<br/>Athletic-Greater<br/>Fierce as a Lion- Heroic<br/>Gentle Demeanor-Lesser<br/>Adept-Staff Greater<br/>Banded Staff of Quality-Lesser<br/>Honor Code-Greater<br/>Mail-Greater<br/>Knight-Greater<br/>Agile-Lesser<br/><br/>Challenges: Poor, Shy<br/><br/>Dooms &amp; Triumphs: Slew Hunger "zombie", Witness his fathers act of love and faith, cursed by the dragon Hunger. <br/><br/>Likely if the campaign had continued Hunger would have returned--the Gm liked the Locust like dragon and its breath that devoured everything in its path by living magical locusts whose touch feasted <br/>on you and made zombies when they expired of those near them. Aethric would have to by off shy, as he's continually forced to face "that woman" and act as the more social and delicate representative of the people of the area. Plus<br/>his growing courage tended to make him truly more and more likely to push himself out of that places. Mind you the history is all from memory.<br/><br/>Want something more specific?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281178">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281178/#Comment_281178" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-16T16:30:55+00:00" title="July 16, 2010  4:30PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            snagged.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_281211">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Silverlion" title="Silverlion"><img alt="Silverlion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/943/nF5ZRHUHC8M5A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Silverlion">Silverlion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281211/#Comment_281211" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-16T22:48:07+00:00" title="July 16, 2010 10:48PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For those interested a friend put up MORE review.
