That would allow for a camera/audience to see faces but players could all still see each other.<br/><br/>If you really wanted it to be more like a stage production, you could make a quick guide to the evening's dungeon with a map and some callouts to the monsters and treasures in the different rooms.  You could fold it like a playbill at a community theater and give it out to the audience.  That way the audience can see everything laid out while the players are in the dark about the evening's adventure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333871">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333871/#Comment_333871" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-11T10:38:39+00:00" title="July 11, 2011 10:38AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p><strong><a href="/forums/profile/ivan">@ivan</a></strong></p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>You might also want to use hypersimplified rules to not lose your audience.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>I <em>wish</em> I had had the option of choosing the game, but I didn't.

If I'd known you were running, I would have come by.<br/><br/>I *love* the idea of giving the audience secret insider knowledge. Either a display of some sort or a printed program which would describe the dangers they're about to face (in the context of a dungeon crawl) would be great. "Little do the heroes know that in the room behind the altar there is fire demon [...] the main threat is that the demon has a powerful weapon which [...] how will they find a way past the Ogre on the bridge, an opponent far too dangerous for them to fight on even terms?" Etc.<br/><br/>That would give people who have no clue about roleplaying some sense of what to watch for and what's interesting.<br/><br/>System-wise and presentation-wise, some new design would definitely add to the drama of the proceedings. For example, some kind of central raised table with dice on it, which players would have to approach in order to roll, would make a big difference. "Ok, Mark, step on up to the dice!"<br/><br/>I love the idea of doing "confessionals" or similar asides to the audience. Perhaps, like a sporting event, you could have expert commentary, where commentators explain especially smart (or especially stupid) tactical decisions by the players. Or even moments where a commentator pauses play to interview one of the players. "You're in a bit of a bind. You don't have your sword, and there are two dire wolves chasing you. What are you thinking right now?"<br/><br/>But, fantasy aside, I want to hear more about how it went.<br/><br/>Ryan, from your side, what were things you found yourself doing differently as a GM because of the setup?<br/><br/>What were things the players did that might have been different from a "typical" session? It sounds like some of them, at least, were actors or other public persons.<br/><br/>Did the audience seem engaged?

I know I ran a pretty great one-shot, but I was focused on the players, not the audience.</p>\n<p>In all I got the impression that the 'show' part wasn't super for the audience... not exactly the right area was lit, not exactly the right seating, certain people couldn't hear me well.  That's all stuff that Aislinn will be adjusting for the next time. But I got lots of kudos for doing my job well, and people asking for my contact info and how to get into gaming at the break and after the show, so I'm happy to have done it.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333939">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso" title="MikeRiverso"><img alt="MikeRiverso" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/825/n647RY8THQBOA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso">MikeRiverso</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333939/#Comment_333939" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-11T20:49:45+00:00" title="July 11, 2011  8:49PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 11, 2011 8:55PM by MikeRiverso.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm wondering if we should print up a few flyers or cards or whatever with the Toronto gamers meetup group info.

As for the show, my understanding is that it's pretty much a one-time thing as part of the Fringe festival. Might be hard to get attention for something like this without the support from Fringe.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_334052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/otherdoc" title="otherdoc"><img alt="otherdoc" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://otherdoc.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/jimsquared32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/otherdoc">otherdoc</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334052/#Comment_334052" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-12T13:34:11+00:00" title="July 12, 2011  1:34PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This concept has continued to burrow through my mind.

The use of a playset also helps towards choosing props and masks (the sterotyped characters that everyone knows how to play).<br/><br/>I guess that a simplified Polaris-style system would play very well for storytelling-like sessions also involving the audience in conflit resolution.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
