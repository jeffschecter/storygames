So consequences allow you to clearly drive a character to a crisis point, for instance. The character generation stuff now also creates a lot of the material for play.<br/><br/>I guess Malcolm's goal in writing the book is to create an interesting setting and have his rules help the players enjoy that setting, rather than get in the way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_156337">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig" title="Malcolm Craig"><img alt="Malcolm Craig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/contestedground/UntitledAlbum/photo?authkey=UQZ1oivg8Lc#5239981636020065186"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig">Malcolm Craig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156337/#Comment_156337" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-13T15:20:25+00:00" title="July 13, 2008  3:20PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thunder_God</cite>Well, this had become a normal question for me, it's especially fitting, when you buy a game not only as a setting sourcebook:<br/><br/>So, tell us of the system.<br/>Also tell us of how it supports the game's goals.<br/><br/>Cheers.</blockquote>\nHey Guy,<br/><br/>Gregor accurately mentioned that the actual plays comment a lot on how the mechanical elements operate. I can also point you to <a href="http://www.contestedground.co.uk/forum/viewforum.php?f=47" rel="nofollow">the appropriate area on our forums</a>, which give all the rules in the last-but-one variation before the game went to print.<br/><br/>However, in brief the conflict resolution mechanics are D10 dice pool based, highest number vs highest number (if you're familiar with Sorceror you'll be familiar with that part). They support what the game is about by making the characters secrets (hidden agendas) and friends &amp; enemies (relationships) central to conflict resolution. Hidden agendas also operate as something of a pacing mechanism in the game as well.<br/><br/>As the pitch goes, it's a game of friends, enemies, secrets and consequences and that's pretty much what the system is all about. However, there's a good deal more than that in regard to collaborative game creation, resolving agendas, resolving character crises and so forth that would require a whole lot more space to adequately explain.<br/><br/>Suffice to say, it's my firm belief that the mechanical elements mesh extremely well with the themes and setting of the game. <br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malcolm                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
