(I say this with love; it is the human instinct to strike at a differing viewpoint, but that can grow somewhat unfortunate when the discussions of these contentious issues devolve into endless cycles of Paul nitpicking Tod about what his words really mean, and then nothing gets done.)<br/><br/>Therefore, hey presto! A thread in which we shall discourse upon Illusionism and perhaps even railroading in a strictly positive light. I have some vague memories of maybe having seen something similar some years back, but that's what the cyclical Internet is all about: opportunities to air your experiences and opinions for new people.<br/><br/>In case it wasn't clear, this thread is off-limits to "I was bored when the Illusionist GM pre-empted all my choices" and "I felt betrayed when the Illusionist GM forced their preferred outcome". That's such an everyday discussion with us here, we've already had it, and it leaves the people who might have something positive to say about Illusionism stuck raving defensively against people who say nasty things about their chosen tools of roleplaying. There's a bunch of other active threads in which we can continue complaining about who said what about whose mother.<br/><br/>(Yes, I am aware of how amusingly PC-brigade this thread introduction is shaping out.)<br/><br/>I'll put down some thoughts myself soon, but I hope others will also say their piece about the constructive artistic possibilities of Illusionism; I frankly don't have very deep pockets in this regard myself, Illusionism is very much something I've moved away from in roleplaying.

The last few times when we've argued about it with Contracycle (Gareth) about this, the morality of the matter has been a big, fat issue. The difficulty has apparently been in the fact that the discussion threads have mixed up personal social and creative issues with general ones. The productive <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19132/magicians-choice-when-is-it-good-when-is-it-bad/" rel="nofollow">magician's choice thread from half a year back</a> is a good example of what I mean: reading it in hindsight, it's obvious that Gareth stuck to the question of whether the magician's choice <i>can</i> be moral from the get-go (because it's a favoured technique of his, and it seemed to him like we were shaping up for a general condemnation), while e.g. I was myself mostly discussing the consequences for using this technique <i>in a game where it would be cheating</i>. No wonder that we wrote at cross-purposes there; at some point the discussion veered into basically the same thing we saw this weekend in <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19668/rails-rails-and-definitions" rel="nofollow">the railroading definition thread</a>, with Gareth defending himself vigorously from people who characterize Illusionism (his favoured technical strategy in roleplaying, one he seems to identify with passionately) as a dishonest and exploitative thing. It's been a tragic misunderstanding, especially as we find time and again that when asking for clarification, it doesn't seem to me like any clear thinker <i>actually</i> thinks that Illusionism is condemnable per se. We often have many suspicions about it, and lots of experiences of GMs who have been Illusionistic against player consent, but those personal experiences and historical trends do not logically translate into a condemnation of the practice itself.<br/><br/>So, let's assume a socially healthy Illusionist game project: there's a GM who is respected among their peers for being a talented storyteller, there is a joint decision to bestow this GM with the full discretionary powers over the experience of play, and so on. The Illusionism is strictly consensual: the players know that the game only has rules insofar as the GM decides to adhere to such, and they know that the GM "plays the world" and does that according to mysterious GMing precepts that might or might not originate in that big fat rulebook that sits on the table. The players know their own roles in the exercise, but those roles are not defined in terms of specific procedural tasks so much as by the audience relationship: the players are there to be entertained by a social and interactive show, put up by the maestro. There are likely plenty of player-facing rules, and the players even have narratives thrust upon them about the significance of those rules: the GM is building an interactive experience, and part of that is to let the players participate in the ephemeral level in e.g. task resolution.<br/><br/>This game, as described, is Illusionistic, Auteuristic (easier to imagine Illusionism as such), fully consensual and insofar as I can see, perfectly credible as a bare chassis for some pretty exciting art-form. It's only barely in the envelope of roleplaying as I tend to understand it personally, but that's just my creative preferences speaking there: I'm well aware that some people de-emphasize spontaneous gamelike interactive creative contribution (basically the money-shot in my roleplaying), and emphasize reliable, high-quality narratives, respect for the effort and genius the GM puts into the game, and the other virtues that an Illusionist game is well positioned to achieve.<br/><br/>Thinking about myself and the challenge of this Illusionist proposition, I admit to a slight failure of imagination regarding the core question: when and why would I structure a game like this intentionally? My personal answer involves horror roleplaying: in this genre over any others I'm most willing to do a little bit of prep work in advance as a GM, so as to come to the table armed with the most subtly horrifying phantasmagories. I love playing games like <i>Dread</i>, <i>Don't Rest Your Head</i> and <i>Dead of Night</i>, all of which are basically thrusts at the same core game of "yo GM, make up some scary shit and then lavish your delectable menu upon the poor players". This is something that I usually get to do as one-shot sessions a few times a year, as rare treats where I put just a little bit of literary work into my usual mix of sharp rules-use and quick improvised story play.<br/><br/>Illusionist attitudes and techniques <i>could</i> conceivably work for me in this creative context; to have a motivation for Illusionism you have to care about the outcomes (knowing that I usually don't might be either obvious or a shock to the reader, but that's how it is - my usual rpg schemes strive towards result-agnosticism), and I could certainly see myself prepping with outcomes in mind. My usual horror rpg scenario is basically just a bunch of scary images and fantasy theology (names, images, relationships of the fell forces), but it would be easy enough to sort of backtrack into a '90s mindset and think in terms of setpiece encounters: wouldn't it be cool if I could make it so that these two PCs fall in love, get married and find out they're siblings in the climax of the game? Ordinarily I would merely jot down the theme of "incest" and leave the rest to shape up in play, but perhaps with an Illusionist chassis and technique tool-box I could get more ambitious about preplanning my horror story.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's my take on a hypothetically relevant way for me to utilize Illusionism in a manner that I could find personally worthwhile. The question is: what do you accomplish by Illusionism, or what might you accomplish?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436911">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436911/#Comment_436911" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-10T21:01:46+00:00" title="August 10, 2014  9:01PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Excellent.

In other words, the horror game might be the most natural fit for a type of GMing toolbox that has misleading and misinforming the players in a major role. Not that well-defined systems can't do abusive horror (MLwM, a classic example), but a mysterious, arbitrary GM just might do that approach one better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436913">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436913/#Comment_436913" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-10T21:16:03+00:00" title="August 10, 2014  9:16PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very well, I think that we are on the same page, then. Here's a quote of what I wrote in the other thread - it appears it fits this one perfectly.\n<blockquote><br/>This thread has led me to think about railroading (in this case, meaning tight GM control over the storyline in a way which is not negotiated with the group).<br/><br/>There are three reasons/rationales I can see for the use of that technique. I'm going to list them here, perhaps that will help the discussion along. I'd also be curious to hear if there are other rationales not covered by these three categories.<br/><br/>1. It's seen as an 'easy way out'. This was probably reinforced (or even created?) by early module-writers who were trying to "tell stories", as can be seen in a lot of, e.g. early 90's published adventures. (It's entirely possible that many of these writers never played any games, as well - I've heard several such admissions on the internet, at least some of them might be true.)<br/><br/>Explaining how to do something open-ended and interactive is simply more complex than writing a linear story. It's easy for a designer or module-writer (or a GM preparing an adventure) to assume a linear story and prepare that. <br/><br/>Similarly for a GM in the middle of a game: it might be easier to just use the powers granted by the GM-seat to roll ahead at the players' expense than to try to create open-ended situations (or whatever else the game normally calls for). Less effort, less thinking involved - it's late and you're tired and the game has to wrap up in an hour.<br/><br/>Simply enough: it's easier. (Or at least seen as being easier.)<br/><br/>2. Playing a "railroaded" or linear story means that you know what will happen in advance. <br/><br/>This means that a creative individual can use all kinds of storytelling tools to craft a certain experience. Props and tools, like maps and miniatures and handouts and NPC portraits. A careful setup for future events, like foreshadowing, thematic coherence, dramatic coincidences, and so forth. Simply taking the time to craft elements (e.g. NPCs, prophecies, locales, even game rules like "custom moves") in advance might be a huge boon to someone who isn't creative enough (or confident enough) to come up with those things "on the spot". Statting up a monster or opponent in a highly-complex system is another example (if you can't do it on the fly, you need some other solution).<br/><br/>The idea here is that the GM gives herself extra time to prepare more carefully, and then makes sure that the preparation isn't wasted. This, in theory, allows a higher creative/artistic level to be reached in play. <br/><br/>Maybe you can play out a game where you have a mask you can put on for each of the characters the PCs meet, for example. A lot of people would find that cool.<br/><br/>Perhaps the best example I can think of is the "4 out of 7 cried" thread we had here on Story Games, as well as some of TomasHMV's accounts of his games. (I've never participated in a fun/successful/functional game like this myself, however. And I do note that all the examples I'm referring to were *consensual*, not hidden or disguised. May be a coincidence, of course.)<br/><br/>3. The GM is, not to mince words, a *better roleplayer* than the players in the game. Her input is *better*.<br/><br/>I suspect this is often a hidden feature/motivation behind railroading practices: the GM, simply, considers herself to have better ideas/better taste than the players, and therefore it is desirable to give precedence to her view and/or artistry over the other players.<br/><br/>In this case the idea is that the GM takes charge of the gaming group and the fictional events as they unfold, so that the entire group may benefit from her brilliance. Giving precedence to the "best" player at the table gives the group leadership and allows the game to reach a higher artistic level than it would if everyone were contributing equally: the group is raised up to a higher level and their game is better this way than if they defaulted to the "lowest common denominator".<br/><br/>This has a dark side - megalomaniac GMs, people who do this without consent, and so forth, which we've discussed to death - but it also has a positive or constructive side. I could see that being the case with an adult running a game for a group of young children, for example. Another example is someone teaching a game to a group for the first time, or any experienced gamer playing with a group of people who are beginners, shy, or unsure of themselves. <br/><br/>The person with better skills or more experience improves the game by contributing to it more than the other people playing.<br/><br/>This is already the case in most typical GMed RPGs - in most social contracts, the GM has more input into the game (choosing the system being played, to go back further to before the game even begins, for example) than the players do, and this is often seen as a positive. It can also be the case in collaborative games, like someone who "facilitates" a session of Fiasco.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>These three rationales all have different levels of potential problems, and at least I, having seen bad examples of all three, cringe a little when considering them. In every case, the tradeoff is individual choice and free will. (For me, this becomes a bit of a social/political/philosophical issue, where I'd rather preserve individual freedoms and teach players and GMs how to be better, rather than adopt a totalitarian or dictatorial hierarchy in a hobby which is primarily a social activity.) <br/><br/>However, as the "4 out of 7 cried" thread demonstrates, there are definitely times when each of these techniques is just the thing, and a group or designer/writer who desires it or needs it. (For instance, for a short game with strangers, like D&amp;D's 1-hr "Encounters" or other game demos, most of us have no complaints about using pre-gen characters. In a similar fashion, arguments could be made for limited fictional options as a player in such a game. We accept limited choice in a Choose Your Own Adventure book as an inherent limitation of the medium, as well.)<br/></blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436914">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436914/#Comment_436914" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-10T21:17:10+00:00" title="August 10, 2014  9:17PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 10, 2014 9:19PM by Paul_T.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>In my mind, and in my experience, none of these situations in any way require illusion or non-consent. I can't see any reason not to be above-board about what's happening and why, either in the game or module design, or in GM techniques. I always want to know what we're playing and how and why. If I'm at your gaming table, don't lie to me.<br/><br/>(Perhaps this is why Tod's discourse on the topic of railroading occasionally worries me: "If it's done well, you'll never notice!" That's a scary thought to me, not an appealing one.)<br/><br/>However, I know that some people actually *enjoy* the whole smoke-and-mirrors, magician's-trick school of roleplaying games. "Oh, my! That all turned out just as planned! How did he DO that?" "I don't want to know!"<br/><br/>(If you need an example, consider the typical D&amp;D combat where the monster has an unlimited number of hit points, and then is declared dead by the GM at the moment that seems most dramatic, or after the players "have fought hard enough". This is a perfect example of this kind of technique, and the type of thing that players occasionally say they don't want to know about.)<br/><br/>EDIT - Here's another good example from a different thread:\n<blockquote><br/>We may tend to think of these boundaries as being a defensive line for the GM's purposes ("plot" the typical jewel being protected).  But some boundaries might be placed to prevent the PCs from getting into trouble they're not ready to handle yet.  "Don't confront the Boss before you get the sword" kinda thing.  Not because of pacing or plot <i>really,</i> but simply because the GM knows that if they face that guy now, they're dead.<br/></blockquote>\nIf you're one of those people, what's the appeal for you? What leads you to enjoy this kind of game, and what turns you off? What are the perks and what are the drawbacks?</blockquote>\nEero, I think your hypothetical "horror" scenario points at some of these, except that you've developed so many non-Illusionist techniques over time that the first point no longer applies. (That is, the appeal of it being "easier" is no longer present for you; if anything, it sounds more challenging, perhaps, for being unfamiliar.)<br/><br/>You also mention, in the final part of your post, something else I've also thought about:\n<blockquote>One thing I think about myself sometimes (but haven't seen in action) is using GM force - railroading - in order to reinforce a certain theme.<br/><br/>For example, I can imagine some kind of dystopian future where machines control our fate (or a game which questions the existence of free will, or a game in which a certain outcome is fated, like an Oedipus Rex RPG). In that game, it might be effective to use railroading techniques to make the player feel some of the hopelessness of the character.<br/><br/>I don't know if I'd enjoy such a game as anything more than a one-shot or one-time experience, but the thematic connection there is interesting (from a design perspective, at least).</blockquote>\nAs another poster commented, <i>Paranoia</i> is one commercial example of such a game. (And supported by the rules text, which tells the GM to keep certain things mysterious from the players, punish them arbitrarily, and so forth.)<br/><br/>All in all, we seem to have a similar perspective on this, as far as I can see.<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to hearing some other people's thoughts on this!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436915/#Comment_436915" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-10T21:24:27+00:00" title="August 10, 2014  9:24PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The magician's choice thread link is off a bit.<br/><br/>Here is <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/428006" rel="nofollow">one about supposedly Illusionist advice in Shaintar</a>.<br/><br/>I do think you can find people who directly make the judgments you suspect nobody is making in your OP. <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/425321" rel="nofollow">here</a>, for example, it's compared to spitting into someone's drink (for years, actually!) and assault.

To me it's pretty obvious, as it was at the time of that thread, that these people are discussing situations where a GM has usurped extra-systemic powers in direct contradiction to what the players believed of them. That poison comment, for example, is directly followed by acknowledging that it's cool if it is what the players want, but they don't want to be ambushed like that themselves. So the consent is key, Illusionism vs. Participationism is only relevant in that Participationism is automatically consensual.<br/><br/>The subtle point that Gareth belabored so effectively today in the other thread stands: Illusionism-with-consent is possible (even if not common in many of our experiences), and <i>that</i> is the point where I doubt that any sensible person would disagree. Those venomous sentiments are directed, even if imprecisely at times, towards non-consensual Illusionism, I think. If we truly have somebody here who has an issue of principle with the idea that somebody might choose to be bamboozled for entertainment, do please let me know, and then go kick some stage magicians - they clearly deserve it, the sick fucks.<br/><br/>But anyway, be that as it may, let's not get into the who-said-what in this thread. Rather, you should tell us about how Illusionist techniques have improved your gaming, Jason. One striking example of an appealing gaming activity where Illusionism is necessary for the effect is all it takes to convince this hairy crowd that the ol' girl still has a place in the long-house next winter, next to the fire pit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436917/#Comment_436917" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-10T21:43:22+00:00" title="August 10, 2014  9:43PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The problem is that any time I said 'railroading can do this really cool thing' (like, say, beginning or skipping to an in media res situation or forcefully scene framing a cool situation), everyone immediately started screaming NO IT CAN'T IT'S EVIL and that was the end of that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436919/#Comment_436919" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-10T21:46:31+00:00" title="August 10, 2014  9:46PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If anyone does that in this thread, we'll show them the door.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436921">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436921/#Comment_436921" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-10T21:50:34+00:00" title="August 10, 2014  9:50PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for taking the Illusionism conversation out of the Rail Theory conversation.

If illusionism is used consensually, it is fair<br/>2. Illusionism can be used consensually<br/>3. Therefore, illusionism can be used fairly<br/><br/>So now the question is if fair and positive are equivalent for our purposes. If so, we've proven that some context exists where illusionism is positive \u2013 time to think up a few examples and call it a day. If not, then no conclusion can be drawn yet.<br/><br/>Next we could to demonstrate that illusionism causes some sort of kantian detriment to roleplaying or makes it no longer "true" roleplaying. This would end the discussion because positive illusionism doesn't exist within the realm of roleplaying. If we can't prove that, then we should accept illusionism is at LEAST a neutral force.<br/><br/>I'm saying this because proving it's a positive force or SOMETIMES a positive force seems too open ended and vulnerable to people's preferences.<br/><br/>Anyway, just some thoughts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_436925">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/contracycle" title="contracycle (Banned)"><img alt="contracycle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/contracycle">contracycle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436925/#Comment_436925" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-10T22:35:24+00:00" title="August 10, 2014 10:35PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 10, 2014 10:38PM by contracycle.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, let me say this, then.<br/><br/>I don't regard myself as a "story-teller".  In fact I think the whole idea of "story" is largely a red herring for games; the term seems to carry some cachet that makes it worth aspiring to, but I'm not at all sure that this is the case.  So the expectation, or assumption, that I have some "story" in mind, and that I'm determined to carry it out, by hook or by crook, and that the players exist purely as a passive audience to be bathed in the glow of my awsomeness, this, I think is totally off base.  That really is not what I'm doing.<br/><br/>There are some elements of "story" which I do make use of.  Such as the truism that a story has a beginning, a middle, and an end.  This is a useful thing for entirely practical purposes: there is a limit to how much prep can be done in advance, and how fast it can be done along side regular play.  It is useful for me to structure something so that it has a beginning, and middle, and end, mainly so that it does actually have an end.  I've run and played too many games that eventually just petered out, that tried to maintain continuous time too long, that lost all their punch and vigour.  For this reason, aiming to have an end, something with what might be called a degree of closure to it, is a useful practical strategy.  If I can take a plot, and wrap it up, and then go away and plan the next one, then IME the overall experience is much more satisfying for everyone involved.<br/><br/>Now the obvious corollary there is that I'm actually not really invested in specific outcomes after all.  It may be necessary for me to contrive some way for the villain to be able to get away in the course of act 1, but it's not like I'm necessareily commited to some specific grand finale setpiece.  If the players manage to contribute stuff that would make for a better ending, or something of that ilk, I'm quite happy to roll with it.  It's also far from impossible for me to set up some dilemma, and let the players answer it how they willl... although, I will expend effort into trying to prevent that dilemma being short-circuited or obviated such that it ceases to provide a sufficiently climactic climax.<br/><br/>Story, therefore, is a tool which aids the structure of play, which can make the experience of play more satisfying.  But is not the real point of the exercise, the real point is something Explorative.  So frex, one game I ran was based on the question, what if the Celtic peoples of Europe had not been conquored by the Romans and the Germanic peoples, but had instead developed into a medieval-level society by themselves?  What would that look like?  That was the real purpose of the game.  To the extent that I had a "story", which in this case was about how the warriors in a princes retinue deal with dynastic politics, that existed only in so much that it provided motivation to the characters, gave me a stable of NPC's to speak through, locations to go to, all of them various means and mechanisms to explore the underlying question for which purpose the setting had been created.<br/><br/>So for me, "story-telling" is not the point of play at all; it's a device, it is itself a technique, which we use to bring things to the table, things like my setting exploration, or character portrayal, or understanding inter-personal relations in societies very different to our own.  Those things are the real point of the exercise.  The "story" exists only in order to have some momentum, some direction of travel, and some way of saying, OK we're finished now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436930/#Comment_436930" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-11T00:59:37+00:00" title="August 11, 2014 12:59AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 11, 2014 12:59AM by AsIf.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "In the movie world, we have to pretend that everybody's gonna like our work.

Let's go see a show together on Monday, yeah?" - and a timid culture where things aren't stated explicitly: "Um, so you have Mondays off, you say? That must be nice. I wish I had Mondays off, too. I heard there's a pretty cool show on Mondays on Coronation Street. Funny, that reminds me: I actually will get a Monday off next week." (Expectant stare.)<br/><br/>Everyone's on board with the process (which is essentially exactly the same), there's just a bit of social taboo around talking about it overtly.<br/><br/>Does that sound about right? The two games we're describing are identical functionally - the players are just communicating less directly.<br/><br/>ETA: Or is this actually different? A game where the players are being directed this way, and they *do not realize it*? In other words, do you believe the game is better this way (for players who enjoy it, of course) just because the players don't say that's how it works out loud, or is it actually the case that they don't even know it's going on at all?<br/><br/>I find the latter has slightly disturbing implications (partially because it's very hard to prove in any way that someone enjoys something more than another thing when they can't tell the difference), but if you have seen some evidence that people enjoy that more, I'll take your word for it! (Although I hope you will be able to explain it or at least describe it in some detail.)</blockquote>\nDescibing it as taboo seems like a negative thing.  I'm saying that it's positive, that it is the draw.  So it's not like timidity at all, because I can think of no scenario where that sort of timidity is actively pursued.  Nor is it that they are communicating less directly, it is that that sort of direct communication is undesirable, contrary to their interests.<br/><br/>As for whether they know it's going on at all, that depends whether you mean at the SC level or the play level.  at the SC level, yes of course they should, otherwise they can't agree to it.  At the play level, ideally they would not know.<br/><br/>This is the distinction between the curtain being up or down.  When it's up, in participationism, the GM might say something like, so look, I forgot about Bob's Kill Nasty Things ability, this Big Bad needs a few more HP, I'm giving it 10, and everyone is OK with that.  With the curtain down, the GM does this unilaterally, without letting anyone know, because they specifically do not want to know.  If it were done openly, it would force them to see the sticks and wires, which is what they are trying to avoid.<br/><br/>The consent to do that is given in principle, beforehand, and not at the moment of play, when it would intrude into the fiction.<br/><br/>And if you're thinking that this might make it hard to know whether you're doing it right, yes it can.  I'm quite happy to discuss these things after the fact, happy to confess to the fact that I had forgotten Bob's Kill Nasty Things and had to intervene on the fly, precisely so I can get feedback and judge whether this was the right decision or not.  And I have been congratulated both for the fact that the intervention succceeded, and that the players did not realise it was happening.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436935">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436935/#Comment_436935" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-11T04:28:33+00:00" title="August 11, 2014  4:28AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 11, 2014 3:18PM by AsIf.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One night about a month ago I had expected a party of 3 (me being 4) for Fiasco, but it turned out to be a party of 5 (me being 6), so I needed something else, something simple and no-prep.  I grabbed Lady Blackbird and printed out the sheets.<br/><br/>Some of these people were regular Players in my group, and they're getting the hang of various playstyles, from heavily-GMd to totally freeform.  LB is somewhere in the middle.  A couple of these people had very little experience but knew how traditional D&amp;D worked.  And these 2 people weren't going to be around next week.  I wanted to give them something cool.<br/><br/>So the party gets out of the cell, they're moving through the ship, they're taking out the guards, but there's a lackluster feeling, they're not adding much detail, perhaps the two groups felt slightly uncomfortable in front of each other.  Whatever it was, I didn't want it to drag the game down.  So, as they turned a corner near where they've learned the engines will be, I stood up and began pointing out things: the massive engines pumping out steam, the pipes and pistons everywhere, and a huge sunken level full of tons of coal.  And in an extemperaneous attempt to add more color, I suddenly found myself saying: "There's a catwalk without rails extending way out over the coal pits, it's about ten feet wide and it ends in a large circular platform.  On that platform is a cage.  And in that cage... is a young adult black dragon."<br/><br/>I don't know why I said dragon.  It just sounded cool.  Steampunk plus dragons.  So I began describing it.  The Players were fascinated.  This dragon piqued everyone's curiosity and raised the energy of the whole room,  They decided they had to free the dragon.  Everybody has creative ideas all the sudden!  They approach it and Snargle begins speaking to it, unlocking the cage while the rest of the group holds off some more approaching guards.  A big firefight ensues (they've taken the weapons off the earlier guards they killed, of course).  And then the dragon comes out of its cage, spreading its big wings and roaring, letting out a huge puff of steam.  There are acrobatics!  There's Lord Blackbird (gender switch) shooting lightning bolts and suddenly learning to fly!  There's Snargle diving in front of a guard and getting hurt, so biting the guard's leg, everyone has moved, but another guard turns his weapon at the prostrate goblin when I remembered the dragon hasn't moved and so suddenly CRUNCH! - the dragon bites the guy's head off!<br/><br/>The party makes short work of the remaining guards and continues on their way to the bay holding their vessel, The Owl.  Only now they don't have to solve the problem of stealing and carrying coal... because Lord B does some quick calculations and - whaddya know? - the volume of steam this dragon can put out will be just enough to get them to Nightport, which happens to be (thanks to the word "secrets" in the brief planetary description) - the dragon's home.<br/><br/>When the game was over everybody kept talking about the dragon.  I said "You know, that dragon was totally made up on the spot."  They were flabbergasted.  They thought it was in the game.  In fact they thought saving it was part of the "plot" - and they thought that was cool.  Except there is no plot, I reminded them.  There's only like, 2 pages of rules.  "But what about the steam being exactly enough to power the ship?" LB's Player asked.  "That was just you doing a successful math roll and having a good idea," I answered.  He smiled quizzically.  "Huh," he said.<br/><br/>At that moment I realized I had deflated his bubble.  You know and I know that I had no plan for the dragon at all - it was simply color when I created it.  And I certainly never thought of using the dragon to power The Owl.  That was his idea.  But I got the distinct impression that he really <span style="text-decoration: underline;">wanted</span> it to be <i>a puzzle that he had solved correctly,</i> and I let him down by revealing that it was just me being a generous collaborator.  I should have simply smiled enigmatically, like a good illusionist.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436938">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436938/#Comment_436938" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-11T07:16:09+00:00" title="August 11, 2014  7:16AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 11, 2014 7:17AM by Paul_T.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Gareth.

The definitions I always use, right or wrong, are Illusionism=no-consent, Participationism=with-consent. Maybe that clears up my feelings in other threads.<br/><br/>Now for this thread...<br/><br/>My wife Steph and I co-GMed a house-rules tabletop for a couple years. It was very popular, with 10-15 different players over its lifetime and a solid group of 5-7 players every week. Because the rules were little more than "here's a character sheet and some dice/conflict rules," we did a lot of stuff by GM fiat, and that made it easy to do illusionist tricks. I was in my middle years between Old School D&amp;D gaming and all this newfangled storygaming. I was just starting to dislike hard-railroading techniques, but Steph loved them. Steph wasn't then, but she is now a professional fiction author with over a dozen books to her name, several of which have won peer awards and one of which hit the B&amp;N Bestseller's list. She's a good storyteller. She had those players at the table eating out of her hand. <br/><br/>We often would strategize between games what outcomes we wanted from the game and how to manipulate players' emotions and beliefs to get them to think that the path they were taking was their own, when it was our path all along. We wanted a traditional story arc and we got it. When people went off the rails, we set the dice difficulties higher or made them roll several times. Davey was the typical guy who was always running off on "adventures" that had nothing to do with the story line that we (GMs)--or even the rest of the players--were vaguely interested in pursuing. In this sense, there was strong agreement that the story was "on rails," or at least that certain stuff was core story and other stuff didn't have anything to do with existing plotlines they were pursuing. I guess we let him try to go on these adventures half the time because there was this sense of "the setting's world is real and we can't constrain you!" while constraining them all the time with hidden GM Force. Sometimes, though, Davey had weird, wild success against all odds and did real heroic crazy things that we all reveled in.<br/><br/>The plot was so much on rails that there was even a rewind-and-redo moment where they had messed up so bad, that it turned out they all had been in the Dream World of the goddess of sleep, and so they had a chance to wake up and do it right this time, with all the weird deja vu that suggests. We manufactured the Dream World scenario very early on, though, to be fair, starting their first or second session with an encounter with the goddess in a misty haze one morning. When they awoke from a 6-month-RL dream, they didn't throw things at us, but rather there was a lot of 'ohhhhhh! of course!' because we'd set it up. But it was hidden GM Force in a lot of ways.<br/><br/>We kept characters alive a lot. The combat rules were shaky and we'd often handwave things to keep them alive, or tweak enemies on the fly to have them fall just before the PCs died. How dramatic! The players might have suspected we were cheating, but they didn't seem to care. The story we were telling (okay, that Steph was telling) was amazing. Players cried real tears at a couple times. Lots of drama and emotion.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436952">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DustinDePenning" title="DustinDePenning"><img alt="DustinDePenning" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DustinDePenning">DustinDePenning</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436952/#Comment_436952" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-11T17:45:46+00:00" title="August 11, 2014  5:45PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great example, Adam!<br/><br/>Also, more abstract thought.

It's a fucked up phrase, and people should realize that it should be buried. I think "illusionism" says more about the people using that word than anything about the game style. It's like me trying to describe what Scientology is. I can tell you, describing it without using the word "nuts" is going to be hard. So why are we using a term coined by those who will find it as hard to be objective as me with Scientology?<br/><br/>I've been hesitant in writing the thing below, because I don't think it will give anything. It wont change anything in the previous paragraph. People will still talk about something else instead of how to use this playstyle in a good way. It's the reason why I didn't bother with <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/19630/bite-sized-ap-the-railroading/p1" rel="nofollow">Paul_T's thread</a>. It's one of those "Yeah, yeah, I can listen in attempt of acceptance but I wont believe it" kind of gestures. Should I really throw away an hour or two of my life to write this? Because the people using sequential stories, like <a href="http://jeepen.org/dict/" rel="nofollow">Vi \xe5ker Jeep</a>, already knows this, and the rest wont listen. What <b>AsIf </b><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/19643/railroading-theory-a-functional-analysis/p1" rel="nofollow">got in his thread</a> was a bunch of loudmouths that couldn't listen to what he wrote (which is hilarious in an ironic way. People opposed sequential stories in that thread, claiming that the game master should listen to what the players are doing, aren't being able themselves to take in what others are saying.)<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>I use sequential stories when I want to a) show a story, b) show a setting, or (both A and <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> c) show a history. The players are there to get a <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/433053#Comment_433053" rel="nofollow">sensation</a> out of it. They can also be there to focus on character personification. I'm mostly for <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/436290#Comment_436290" rel="nofollow">ballistic play</a>, meaning that the players can do whatever they want but some results wont change.<br/><br/>Every adventure I wrote when I was younger was based around ballistic play. It was the consensus of our group so I never thought of bringing it up, because it was the only playstyle we  knew. Nowadays, our range of playstyles are different, so I'm keen on telling my group (or the one I had, at least) if it was going to be sequantial, a fish tank or collaborative storytelling. Funny thing though, I don't do this at conventions. I feel it's still a consensus that those scenarios are sequential in some way. Hey, you got a four or six hour spot to fill and sequential stories are easier to handle when it comes to time. You just drag out scenes or remove some of them in order to end at the right time.<br/><br/>Anything sequential play is great when it comes to showing something, but it takes players to want the sensation. If a player shows up expecting collaborative storytelling, <i>then</i> you got a dysfunctional play. So never blame the playstyle, it's the collision of playstyles that is wrong.<br/><br/>[edit] changed "linear" to "sequential".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436970">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436970/#Comment_436970" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-12T03:26:02+00:00" title="August 12, 2014  3:26AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>If elements of game system are discovered to be "broken", or a pre planned module is discovered to not suit the party's taste, is it wicked to use illusionism to "fix" the situation?</blockquote>\nDustin, it\u2019s hard to discuss illusionism in a positive light while pointing out that a particular use of it is wicked.

So please take this question in a positive light! I am just trying to understand your point of view. This is not a criticism, but a question asked from a curious person who wishes to learn more and believes that there's no such thing as a stupid question (not if your goal is to increase your understanding, anyway).<br/><br/>OK! Your Lady Blackbird dragon-rescue adventure:\n<blockquote><br/>At that moment I realized I had deflated his bubble.  You know and I know that I had no plan for the dragon at all - it was simply color when I created it.  And I certainly never thought of using the dragon to power The Owl.  That was his idea.  But I got the distinct impression that he really <span style="text-decoration: underline;">wanted</span> it to be <i>a puzzle that he had solved correctly,</i> and I let him down by revealing that it was just me being a generous collaborator.  I should have simply smiled enigmatically, like a good illusionist.<br/></blockquote>\nHere's the part I wonder about when I read this: isn't this illusionist practice you're saying you should have followed somewhat like faking one's orgasms in bed?<br/><br/>What I mean is: one person expects a certain outcome, but that's not what happens. To make them feel good, the other person lets them believe that, yes, that's exactly what happened.<br/><br/>In a sexual relationship, this is problematic, because now the artifice must be continuously maintained or the whole relationship comes crashing down ("I've been faking it with you for the last seven years!"*). The stakes (the related disappointment) climb higher and higher each time the behaviour is repeated. In addition, whatever attitudes and techniques were being used to achieve this effect (but are in fact the wrong techniques) in the player's eyes are effectively being reinforced, so you're even *less* likely to achieve the desired cool gaming moment/orgasm in the future. You're rewarding the wrong stimulus, in other words, and then telling someone it worked, so they'll just keep doing it.<br/><br/>Doesn't this just force you to build higher and higher walls of deception, once you've committed to this path, with the constant threat of someone figuring it out and ruining the game experience for good?<br/><br/>And this is all assuming the same play group with the same GM. The problems potentially grow further if we think of migrating to different partners/a new group/a different GM.<br/><br/>Or does this analogy not apply? If so, why not? Where does the difference lie?<br/><br/><br/>*: Not autobiographical, I swear!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436977">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436977/#Comment_436977" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-12T03:46:26+00:00" title="August 12, 2014  3:46AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>This seems a bit harsh, Rickard.

Sandra, I figure this may be one reason for your values re playstyle, and perhaps even for your occasional bursts of anger at trad GMs.  If social contract is difficult for you, maybe you're thinking too hard about it.  But this thread is only about games where a potential for Illusionism exists; therefore single-GMd games.  When you are the GM, you are the offerer of the contract.  It's that simple.  You wrote the contract yourself.  You are under no obligation to use a contract written by anyone else.  You simply need to make your terms clear, and take the authority to be in charge of the group's experience.  If they hate it they only lost a few hours and they can never come back if that's what they want.<br/><br/>[The word "authority" is a red flag for someone here, guaranteed.  Just remember the kind of game we are talking about in this thread.  There are times when you will have to demonstrate it, and at those times you must be worthy of it - from <i>their</i> standpoint.]<br/><br/>Any game with even a possibility of "Illusionism" is a game that requires <b>Facilitation</b>.  We can call it all different things, but Group Facilitation is what it really is.  Group Facilitation is a natural talent for some, but it's also a skill that almost anyone can learn, practice, and get good at.  You can read books on it.  You can take classes.  Basically, you want to show the group that there's a good <i>reason</i> for giving you control right now.  There are many ways to convince people to do that (rhetoric, power, money, pity, etc), but since this is a Leisure Activity after all, the easiest approach is to make their experience (of you in control) be <i>Entertaining</i>  I.e., Fun.  If you're of an Artistic bent, that's another option, depending on audience.<br/><br/>You take an elevated position in the group through (a) being a good host and (b) your performance (in both senses of the word), for instance: You take the floor prior to the session, you get everyone's attention, and you take the authority they are granting you.  It's just like running any other kind of meeting.  You just take it.  Then you back it up.  <br/><br/>Introduce yourself and say what your function is tonight.  While you are performing, you are your friendliest, your most confident, your most charismatic, your most entertaining, your most clever (and depending on the game, your most cryptic &amp; mysterious).  Make sure they're all following you, and then simply <i>tell them</i> what they're gonna do tonight.  "Okay, tonight we're playing blah-blah.  This is a game where you blah-blah and I blah-blah.  But what's different about this game is blah-blah."  If there's any extreme content or bleedy things about the game, explain those things and make sure everybody's still onboard (Lines and Veils).  Put down an X card and explain that too if you want.  "So that's how this game works.  Everybody ready to give it a shot?  Ok, here we go!"<br/><br/>Like a teacher in a classroom, a speaker at a podium or a guide on a hike, you take the authority, you demonstrate competence, you instill Trust (which may be personal, artistic, or simply a willingness to go along), you explain the exercise, and you guide the exercise.  This isn't a negotiation at all.  It's a straightforward demonstration of your offer, which is either accepted or not.  Just remember: If it sucks, it's your fault.  So don't suck.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437016">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437016/#Comment_437016" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-12T07:25:08+00:00" title="August 12, 2014  7:25AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Sandra, I figure this may be one reason for your values re playstyle, and perhaps even for your occasional bursts of anger at trad GMs.</blockquote>\nI\u2019m more angry at the game designers than the GMs, but yes.

If it's (b), though, think about what that implies\u2014that the GM *has* to place the dragon in the players' path, even if that's implausible, and that if they don't think on their own of using it in the prescribed way, he has to somehow get them to do it, or the adventure stalls.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/snej">@snej</a>: In theory, different people having different preferences should be no big deal.

about the dragon.  I said "You know, that dragon was totally made up on the spot."  They were flabbergasted.  They thought it was in the game.  In fact they thought saving it was part of the "plot" - and they thought that was cool.  Except there is no plot, I reminded them.  There's only like, 2 pages of rules.  "But what about the steam being exactly enough to power the ship?" LB's Player asked.  "That was just you doing a successful math roll and having a good idea," I answered.  He smiled quizzically.  "Huh," he said.<br/><br/>At that moment I realized I had deflated his bubble.  You know and I know that I had no plan for the dragon at all - it was simply color when I created it.  And I certainly never thought of using the dragon to power The Owl.  That was his idea.  But I got the distinct impression that he really <span style="text-decoration: underline;">wanted</span> it to be <i>a puzzle that he had solved correctly,</i> and I let him down by revealing that it was just me being a generous collaborator.  I should have simply smiled enigmatically, like a good illusionist.<br/><br/></blockquote>\nThis is a rather interesting tidbit, because I don't really see this as being illusionist. It's improvisational. You threw something into the world that would make sense to be there, and then you treated it realistically. It sounds like the players were disappointed that they didn't solve a puzzle that you'd planned ahead of time. Which, of course, doesn't happen with improvisation.<br/><br/>I don't even think that prepping material means that you pre-plan solutions--it's certainly not an approach I follow. Like Vincent Baker advocates in PbtA games, you put stuff in the world and then play to see what happens. The plot is what the players create with the world that you give them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437074/#Comment_437074" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-12T12:42:28+00:00" title="August 12, 2014 12:42PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>You're right, but I was a fool to put that in an advice section of each chapter.

Yes, this is me not engaging with the conversation as it's played out over the thread, rather simply commenting with some initial thoughts. I will read the thread and engage the conversation as it's evolved momentarily...<br/><br/>Illusionism. Illusion of Choice. Railroading. They're all different bits or perspectives on the same thing. The GM has a story in mind that they are running the players through. Those are the rails. This story is happening, despite what the PCs do and the players may want. Railroading. Some players want to feel like they have control despite them having no control whatsoever. The illusion of choice. The act of running a game that is on the rails, ie railroading the story, while also providing the players with the illusion of choice. Illusionism.<br/><br/>There's only deception <i>if</i> the GM isn't upfront about what they're doing. If the GM declares you're running through a module that evening, chances are there's a fairly solid rail on that game. If the GM declares you're a group starting off in a town and starts play with, "What do you do?", chances are there's few, if any, rails involved. If the GM presents the game session as having real, meaningful choices but relentlessly takes the session back to the rails, that is deception, pure and simple. Presenting players with choices they simply don't get to make is deceptive. If the GM doesn't want to be accused of deception, then they should be explicit about what they're doing and be upfront with their players.<br/><br/>However, the mere act of being upfront with the players about the illusion of choice shatters that illusion. Once the players know they have no significant choice to make, they no longer suffer under the illusion of choice. Catch 22.<br/><br/>Also, there's a question of scale. Using a technique like this to jump from scene to scene, or to start the adventure is one thing, but using this throughout is entirely different.<br/><br/>Lastly, this touches somewhat on my thread a few months ago about the expectations of gaming vs the expectations of story. Telling a story has far different goals and needs than playing a game. Though there's a significant overlap of certain ideas and concepts in storytelling and game playing, others are at odds or mutually exclusive.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437086">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snej" title="snej"><img alt="snej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mooseyard.com/JensStuff/Self-portrait%20with%20hat%2032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snej">snej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437086/#Comment_437086" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-12T13:53:38+00:00" title="August 12, 2014  1:53PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Some players want to feel like they have control despite them having no control whatsoever.</blockquote>\nI think "control" is a continuum, and even what you call "no control whatsoever" is actually a <i>lot</i> more control than players of any existing video game are used to, much more control than listening to a traditional storyteller, and of course infinitely more control than watching a movie or reading a book.<br/><br/>No offense intended, but I felt I needed to call out a false dichotomy, because those really cause friction during discussions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437088">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/liblarva" title="liblarva"><img alt="liblarva" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/liblarva">liblarva</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437088/#Comment_437088" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-12T13:58:25+00:00" title="August 12, 2014  1:58PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A lot of what <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> is saying here makes sense...\n<blockquote><br/>This thread has led me to think about railroading (in this case, meaning tight GM control over the storyline in a way which is not negotiated with the group).<br/><br/>There are three reasons/rationales I can see for the use of that technique. I'm going to list them here, perhaps that will help the discussion along. I'd also be curious to hear if there are other rationales not covered by these three categories.<br/><br/>1. It's seen as an 'easy way out'. This was probably reinforced (or even created?) by early module-writers who were trying to "tell stories"...<br/><br/>2. Playing a "railroaded" or linear story means that you know what will happen in advance. <br/><br/>This means that a creative individual can use all kinds of storytelling tools to craft a certain experience...<br/><br/>3. The GM is, not to mince words, a *better roleplayer* than the players in the game. Her input is *better*...</blockquote>\nbut I'd like to point out that in all three of these cases it's the person who's DMing deciding that their creative input is better, more important, and more fun than the players' input. To me, this changes the session from a collaborative game into the players being told a story. I don't play games to be told a story. I play games to collaboratively create a story with my fellow players and GM. In some limited cases, ie a scene here and there, the GM just taking control and making things happens not only increases the fun, but is utterly essential to the fun of the game. But as a general practice it seems to tear out the most fundamental component that separates role-playing games from storytelling, namely the collaboration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437091">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/liblarva" title="liblarva"><img alt="liblarva" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/liblarva">liblarva</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437091/#Comment_437091" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-12T14:19:00+00:00" title="August 12, 2014  2:19PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 12, 2014 3:08PM by liblarva.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>Some players want to feel like they have control despite them having no control whatsoever.</blockquote>\nI think "control" is a continuum, and even what you call "no control whatsoever" is actually a <i>lot</i> more control than players of any existing video game are used to, much more control than listening to a traditional storyteller, and of course infinitely more control than watching a movie or reading a book.<br/><br/>No offense intended, but I felt I needed to call out a false dichotomy, because those really cause friction during discussions.</blockquote>\nToo right and none taken. Control is more than binary, it is a continuum as you say. In movies the audience has zero control over the developing narrative. In books the audience has some control over the narrative in that they can imagine more than just what's on the page. With books and movies the audience can imagine what happens after the narrative ends. In video games, lets take WoW as the base example you have far more control than either books or movies, but you're still at the whim of someone else (rather quite a few other people). You can perform a limited number of actions within a predefined range that only really affect the outcome of the story, ie success/failure. But you can simply brute force things till you succeed. Fight a monster, lose and die, rez and run back. Lather, rinse, repeat.<br/><br/>Further along that continuum you get some RPG modules, where you can plug in your character and largely have control over their actions and dialogue, but the overall story is simply set with only a modicum of control over how it plays out or ends. Will this NPC survive, yes/no. Will the PCs live or die? Being able to write the dialogue for my character within someone else's movie or novel isn't my idea of collaboration.<br/><br/>It's weird, I know, but one of the main reasons I don't play WoW anymore is I couldn't climb the walls as a Rogue. I couldn't sneak into blocked off areas of the game world. A closed area was presented as a tower with a door that couldn't be opened. I couldn't interact with that piece of the world. In tabletop games, I can. Essentially the difference being that possibility to interact with that door. I can open it. Whether I choose to or not is largely irrelevant. I'm happy to play through a given module and stay on the rails as long as I know they're there and that's what we're doing that session. If we're playing a session that's presented as a sandbox and I encounter a door I want to open but the GM just won't allow it. That strikes me as more of a video game or a movie or a book than a role-playing game.<br/><br/>In that bit you quoted above, I was trying to figure out why GMs would feel the need to present false choices to their players. By that I mean, have an idea for a story or scene in mind, but also present a false sense that the players had real input into the story. If the GM thinks a given scene playing out a certain way will be more fun, then why not simply declare it so. The answer's simple, I think: That GM understands that the players want to feel they have control over at least their own part in the story, if not actual input to the outcome of the story as a whole. To circumvent those conflicting goals (GM having control vs the Player thinking they have control), you get GMs who present an illusion of choice. The GM wants to tell a specific story to the players, but knows the players will object. Your analogy to movies and books is accurate, I think. But not necessarily how you intended.<br/><br/>To be in a session where these techniques are being used on a large scale, ie for the story as a whole, is to be the non-participatory audience to someone else's spoken word novel or movie or video game. Not to be a player in a game. I'm trying really hard not to be explicitly judgmental here, though I know I'm failing, but I'm honestly not saying this technique is bad. More that it ceases to be a participatory game and becomes storytelling, that is someone simply telling their audience a story. Nothing wrong with that. But sitting down to play a game you don't expect a movie or a novel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437102">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437102/#Comment_437102" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-12T15:56:01+00:00" title="August 12, 2014  3:56PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the same way that <a href="/forums/profile/snej">@snej</a> is correct about control being a continuum, the zone between "role-playing games" and "storytelling" is actually a blurry area with many levels to it, and different game formats or playstyles enter or cross that region in different ways, on different levels, all the time.

But maybe not for the reasons you'll assume.<br/><br/>I'm not sure that "role-playing games" and "storytelling" are on a continuum. For two things to be on a continuum they typically need to be really distinct to the point of being nearly or literally opposites. Take <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MohsScaleOfScienceFictionHardness" rel="nofollow">Mohs Scale of SF Hardness</a> as an example. This continuum measures how accurate the story is to real world science. Soft vs Hard on the extremes with subtle gradations in-between. If we tried to plot RPGs and traditional storytelling on a continuum, what would we be measuring exactly? Maybe collaboration as mentioned? Possibly. Might work.<br/><br/>But I think they're more like two elements on a Venn diagram, only partially overlapping in the middle. Storytelling, as properly defined, involves a single storyteller with a set story. Other forms certainly exist, say improv storytelling (no set story) or collaborative storytelling (multiple storytellers). However, the essential elements of what these are remains. Only where there's overlap do we get what we're referring to as "story games." Like the differences and similarities between tables and chairs. Certain elements overlap (vaguely flat surface with a means of supporting weight), but that doesn't mean you can put tables at one end of a continuum and chairs at the other.<br/><br/>A <b>game</b> is: <b>a form of play or sport, especially a competitive one played according to rules and decided by skill, strength, or luck</b>.<br/><br/><i>Storytelling</i> is: <i>the conveying of events in words, and images, often by improvisation or embellishment</i>. <br/><br/>So an overly simplistic and clunky definition of a <b><i>story game</i></b> could be: <b>a form of play or sport, especially a competitive one played according to rules</b> for <i>the conveying of events in words, and images, often by improvisation or embellishment</i> that is <b>decided by skill, strength, or luck</b>.<br/><br/>If you remove the essential elements that "game" contributes to this "story game" amalgam, then what you have left is "storytelling". There are no elements of game left. So too by removing the essential elements of "storytelling" from "story game" would you end up with a "game". Again, nothing wrong with gaming or storytelling, but to call a table a chair is still wrong. If you already know how the game is going to end, there's no point in playing it. Ever tape sports and look forward to watching it after work, but before you watch it a friend or coworker tells you the final score? If you even bother to watch it your enjoyment is diminished because the discovery is gone. It's no longer a game if the finale is pre-determined.<br/><br/>Illusionism is just the gaming name used for a storytelling technique. It is neither good nor bad. It is what it is. But certain storytelling techniques do limit the amount of game that can happen. Imagine the GM decides to script your character's dialogue in a certain scene? Or for the entire session? Or campaign? Scripting is a time honored storytelling technique, but it also runs counter to the basic concept of a game. Improv is also a storytelling technique, that by and large gamers flock to (I think because it gives them control and it's their expectation), while they flee from scripting (I think because it takes away their control and is contrary to their expectations).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437112">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437112/#Comment_437112" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-12T17:05:22+00:00" title="August 12, 2014  5:05PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 12, 2014 5:18PM by AsIf.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/liblarva">@liblarva</a> I see your point about the word continuum.

It's not interactive if you have no input. If they have no impact on the success or failure of the thing, it's not a game.<br/><br/>But you're assuming people want the same things from movies and novels as from gaming. I disagree.<br/><br/>In a movie I watch or novel I read, I want someone to tell me a good story and for it to be well told. I'm a writer, so I know more than most about the formulaic nature of this stuff. I'm not saying I'm awesome or anything, just that I know exactly when to get up to pee at the theater. I like when the beats are hit at just the right time, the writer/director plays with the timing a bit, when the scene is well constructed, or the actor disappears into the part.<br/><br/>When people act in a play, they're there because they want to contribute to the production. Play a part, contribute to the whole. Collaborate with a group to help tell a story. When I watch sports, I want to be surprised by the outcome. To see the skill of the player on display. When I play in a game, I want to contribute to the outcome. Good day, bad day. If I'm playing I should have an effect on the outcome, otherwise, why bother playing? Easier to watch a movie if you just want to sit back and be told a story.<br/><br/>Again, I'm not saying there's anything wrong with this. They're not doing it wrong by having a "GM" simply tell them a story. But it definitely does cross over into storytelling as opposed to gaming at that point. Good, bad, or indifferent, if the "players" are not contributing to the thing, it's not a game. The outcome has to be determined by the skill of the players for it to be a game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437118">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437118/#Comment_437118" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-12T17:39:14+00:00" title="August 12, 2014  5:39PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 12, 2014 5:40PM by AsIf.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is</span> a hybrid medium, after all, and we keep hybridizing it further.<br/>This guarantees that at their own points, our metaphors from other mediums will fail to completely capture what's going on.<br/>That's good news, actually.

You can't have a mix of two things without... two things to mix.

But then (hopefully) at some point a Hegelian Synthesis occurs, and the third arising thing is substantially different from its progenitors to be considered a separate thing.  I feel like we passed that point, personally, and we need to find new words for things.  Or maybe we're in the torturous transitional zone in which some alien child is individuating.  Or maybe some of us have passed through that zone but others haven't... that would explain some things, wouldn't it?  Ah.  Yes.  Ok.<br/><br/>To flip back to the nautical metaphor, I think different people pass (or passed, or will one day pass) that point moving in different directions independently, like different ships finding different routes out of a mid-oceanic storm.  As such, some of us believe that the direction they found is the only way to get out.  Then they attack or feel attacked by the reports and charts of other ships, acting like <span style="text-decoration: underline;">they</span> found the only way out.  Then things get ugly.  Egos get involved.  We have to watch out for dogma, superstition, bigotry, etc.  Which is really just us being ignorant, until someone puts together a map of the entire ocean.<br/><br/>So I misspoke above when I said "It is a hybrid medium".

By this view, making a game out of storytelling is reinforcing something that's already integral to its nature. If you've read Bernard Suits' <i>The Grasshopper</i>, you'll recall that he defines a game as any event where the participants agree to try to reach a goal by means other than the most efficient. Make-believe is a game because it would be more efficient to just write a script. You don't need hybridity to get a story-game by this view, just an agreement to abide by a set of rules that produce a narrative by inefficient means.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437133">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snej" title="snej"><img alt="snej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mooseyard.com/JensStuff/Self-portrait%20with%20hat%2032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snej">snej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437133/#Comment_437133" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-12T20:09:41+00:00" title="August 12, 2014  8:09PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>If there's no "game" in a "storytelling game", then it's no longer a storytelling game.</blockquote>\nYou're dichotomizing again, friend.

Winter of Sulfur) when I clearly stated several times to the players that it was going to be a hard railroad. One players said afterwards that he felt their choices mattered. How did I manage to do that?<br/><br/>I can see three techniques that I use: shifting (a term from the Swedish RPG community), cementing, and letting the players take care of it. All three are about how to structure an adventure by how the different information is presented, to be able to steer the players in a way so they can get a sensation of either the plot, setting, or history. Which one, depends on what effect the game master wants to achieve. I'm mostly into delivering a surprise through giving the players an insight. Like I said in my <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/433053#Comment_433053" rel="nofollow">definition of sensation</a>, as a reason of participating in a task: "to experience something. To escape from reality. To get an insight or to live out a different perspective."

Nothing I say in this post should be taken as judgement.<br/><br/>I'm going to bring in the classic GNS terminology here and I'm going to pre-emptively say that I'm not advocating or denying the Forge theory behind these, just using the labels to provoke thought.<br/><br/>Gamism / Step on Up / Competitive or Challenge Play<br/>Illusionism is generally used here to fast-forward efficiently from one challenge to the next, like in a video game (ex. Mass Effect). After all, the players are interested in the challenges and going their own way will lead to less intricate challenges that the GM doesn't have as well prepped. Some groups will find that there is a logical reason to use illusionism because player choice outside of challenges isn't important to them.<br/><br/>Why People get Angry: If challenges are what is important to the players, then the GM has to be very concrete and open about the challenges. ex. Always roll in the open and use baddies that follow the RAW. Challenge focused players with a GM who thinks tactics and battles are just fluff (to be fudged) will rapidly result in a fissure within the group because the GM will be stepping on their creative agenda by taking away the challenge or making it arbitrary.<br/><br/>I've personally played this style of game and it can be great fun. I played in a bit more Participationist style, but that is because I was in a mixed creative agenda group. If you know that all your players care about are challenges, you can go full illusionist with this and have a blast.<br/><br/>I'm going to write a few more posts like this about the other GNS agendas, but the moral of the story is that illusionism is functional, but GMs need to talk with their players about what they <b>really</b> enjoy about the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437194">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nikolai" title="Nikolai"><img alt="Nikolai" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nikolai">Nikolai</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437194/#Comment_437194" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-13T17:50:47+00:00" title="August 13, 2014  5:50PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Continuation of my prior post -&gt;<br/>When is it OK or even optimal (for certain groups) to employ illusionism to manipulate...<br/><br/>...the task resolution mechanics? Probably in situations where the players aren't interested in the result, they are just enjoying the flavor.<br/><br/>For example, the players need to get up a cliff to get to the next cool scene, but neither the players or the GM want the cliff to keep them from getting to that cool scene. They engage the task resolution mechanics because they are there and make it up that cliff regardless of their rolls.<br/>The cliff scene is really just exposition. The GM could have just as easily just thrown in some exposition about the cliff, but engaging the mechanics slows things down a bit and starts building tension. It's like a travel montage in movies where the hero is shown briefly climbing a cliff, loose rocks come loose, then they tough it out and get to the next scene.<br/><br/>...the story toward prepped situations? Probably when the group is invested in getting to these situations and the bulk of their fun is derived from these prepped situations.<br/><br/>...the whole campaign towards an "epic" conclusion? If the players are genuinely most interested in just character-acting, this might be viable. If the players, for example, wanted to recreate the experience of LotR by playing the main characters as they quest...they already know (explicitly or implicitly) the story is going to be fixed and they also already know that the GM is going to bend things to ensure that characters largely live (or die) as fits the story.

Curious about what you guys think about illusionism in a certain context. \n<blockquote> [...]After all, the players are interested in the challenges and going their own way will lead to less intricate challenges that the GM doesn't have as well prepped. [...]</blockquote>\nThis is something I've always wondered about trad RPGs that I enjoy \u2013 I find it fun for there to be concrete challenges, esp. tactical battles. However, I find it fun to be able to make my own decisions and influence the tone or direction of the story.<br/><br/>Here's a snipbit of text from Synthicide, an RPG I'm developing:\n<blockquote><br/><b>PREPARING MISSIONS</b><br/>By using the NPC generator and some creativity, a GM can completely improvise a play<br/>session. However, preparing specific missions always helps. Try the following:<br/><br/><b> Create rough notes for two missions. </b>Don\u2019t have only one mission prepared.<br/>Think up a few characters and two simple stories for the players to explore. You<br/>need to give your players some choice so they feel like their characters\u2019 thoughts<br/>and wishes matter.<br/><br/><b>Still be prepared to improvise.</b>Don\u2019t be afraid to make things up, because your<br/>players will surprise you and do the unexpected. Mentally prepare yourself. Make<br/>sure you have a firm grasp of the game world and how things work. As long as<br/>you keep your story consistent, the players won\u2019t mind or notice when everything<br/>is off the cuff.<br/><br/><b>Don\u2019t be afraid to re-purpose NPCs and ideas.</b> Imagine you created some nasty<br/>gang members for a mission about recovering stolen valuables, but the players<br/>reject it and go explore the jungle outside the colony. Don\u2019t fret! With some<br/>creativity and re-skinning, you can use the exact same NPCs as animal poachers<br/>or drug farmers. Now the mission can be about discovering a crime syndicate in<br/>the jungle and trying to make it back alive.

Forget plot, forget story, forget pet NPCs -- those aren't the point, those are just means to an end.  The <i>end</i> is that the players gasp, or applaud, or get angry, or get scared, or truly feel the weight of a terrible choice.<br/><br/>Some players can still achieve this intense emotional investment with the GM being completely transparent, but for others it's much easier to lose yourself in the experience if the illusion is seamless.<br/><br/>I remember GMing a conversation between the players and a creepy NPC, where I turned off all the lights and led them through this encounter, pretty much prompting their every line of dialogue to create the right effect.  It was essential for the game, you see, that the players had at least a little fear of this NPC, but also that they respected and perhaps even liked him, such that the missions he'd later assign them would inspire rather than gall.  It worked and it was awesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437227/#Comment_437227" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-14T05:03:53+00:00" title="August 14, 2014  5:03AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 14, 2014 1:50PM by Rickard.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my previous posts in this thread, I used the word "playstyle" but that term can mean so many things: freeform, Story Now, player agencies, and probably some more areas. What I think sequential play really is about is more a way of structure how the game is played, very similar\u2014if not the same\u2014as designing a game system. If I want  to present a sensation for my players, I go with either <b>linear play</b> (prewritten places of interaction followed in one order), <b>assembly play</b> (prewritten places of interactions that can be executed in any order) and <b>ballistic play</b> (prewritten start and finish, with the players doing whatever inbetween), or a combination of them (ex. prewritten places of interactions that can be executed in any order with a fixed start and end). Note that the place of interaction can be an event happening, a conversation or an actual place where the players discover something.<br/><br/>Also note that anything can happen in that place, so even if I'm going with linear play, the players can still interact the way they want in that particular scene. I remember one theoretic discussion over at the Swedish roleplaying game community years ago, where one suggested the \xbbpicture frame\xab. "The player can paint whatever they want, but not going outside the frame". I thought it a nice analog for one type of structure for an adventure, but it can also be applied for a place of interaction. An example I hate to use is when you investigate a haunted house. You could run out the house and call the cops at the first sign of weirdness, but that's not how you should play <b>Call of Cthulhu</b>. That's painting outside the (often unsaid) frame. Why do I hate to use that example, even if it shows clearly what I mean? Because I think it's a flaw in the scenario design if you allow that option.<br/><br/>I will talk about three techniques in three different posts: cementing, shifting, and letting the players take care of it (yeah, I couldn't come up with a nifty term for it). I will do that by sharing some play experiences and my thoughts about how I should handle them. Which one I'm going to start with, because I mentioned the CoC example, is now obvious because you need to cement certain things to have a better success at delivering a certain sensation.<br/><br/>[edit] Changed "linear" to "sequential".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Virginian_John" title="Virginian_John"><img alt="Virginian_John" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/601/nK0KBJPN6LXY5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Virginian_John">Virginian_John</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437232/#Comment_437232" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-14T07:32:37+00:00" title="August 14, 2014  7:32AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 14, 2014 7:46AM by Virginian_John.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was playing Tunnels and Trolls 7.5 solo "Strange Destines" yesterday.<br/><br/><b> **SPOILER ALERT**</b><br/><br/>I made my character. The book suggested a whole lot of this and that for character but strongly suggested I play a warrior and some big tough hardy race. The adventure is already railroading me. My character begins underground without equipment. The character finds this famous lost place. I can either go investigate or retreat back into the tunnels. My character retreats.  As the journey progress my character gets a bit tired and then finds a way out of the tunnels and the book says and he exits. Opps! Big mistake not going to investigate the famous place. My character is ambushed by a big nasty. Anyway, this paragraph has a lot of options: fight, find things, get defeated, fumble clumsily about etc. No matter what my character did in this paragraph my destiny was sealed: The last sentence reads, "Regardless, it is THE END." RAILROADED! The book wanted me to take the path of the famous place, but I had other ideas and desires which was not in the cards for my character this day.<br/><br/>Now if I wanted freedom of choice I could have taken the premise of the book and started playing it with Mythic. There would be no predetermined ending; I would not have to save or find the quest item; I could have defeated the Big Nasty and went back to town to heal, reequip, and go back down the tunnel. Anything was possible. <br/><br/><b> **END SPOILER ALERT**</b><br/><br/>I made a choice to play TnT's "Strange Destines" as written knowing that my character's destiny was sealed in with very limited options.

The setup was pretty straightforward. The players played a family with a cruel and abusive father during the 18th century. The cruelness is portrayed at the beginning of the scenario through several scenes, and it should lead up to one member killing the father. The father awakes as an undead and starting to create an army of zombies by brainwashing the citizens of the village, either by magic or by killing them and raise them as undead. What shall the players do to stop that from happening?<br/><br/>Well, what should I do to make this happening? There are a couple of events that are bound to happen but it doesn't start until the father is dead. So that's a bit I cemented. I changed the scenario so the father was already dead. I wrote on each character how they killed the father. One pushed him over an edge to fall into rocks into the sea. Another poisoned him. A third ... well, you get the picture. What had happened was that he had arise only to be killed by another member. The only one innocent was the one playing the father's doctor, and I wrote on the doctor's character sheet that he should investigate what happened (which, amusingly, led 3 out of 4 times to him being framed and often killed by the others).<br/><br/>We started out playing with all characters sitting in a house. It was raining outside and the dad had died. I then took the liberty to jump backwards in time and frame some scenes to show the behavior of the abusive father. I cemented that too. When all this was done, I returned to the house in the rain. The players thinking the dad was dead. The door is thrown open and the dad is standing in the rain, all wet, walking in like nothing had happened. Imagine the players' faces. Imagine the unease they suddenly felt.<br/><i><br/>Cementing through</i> the use of unavoidable scenes. If something must happen, start with it. It sets the tone of the game.<br/><br/><i>Cementing through</i> the use of background information. People will begin to expect something. Use this expectation to your advantage. The example above shows how you can break the expectation to gain an effect.<br/><br/>In the adventure suit Svavelvinter, the linear story goes as follows: characters discover that a temple is abandoned. They are contacted by a group of local barbarians. They are sent to retrieve magic items. An undead king awakes, wanting his sword back, which is one of the magic items they stole. They go to a castle where an evil cult had their residence to kill them. So why should the characters want to go to the temple? Why should they want to retrieve the magic items? Why should they go to the castle of that evil cult?<br/><br/>The adventure itself gives out a couple of goals and character suggestions. One is a priest that wants to contact the temple - only to discover that the priests have been kidnapped (by the cult). Another has a mission to look for a person. A person who the character later finds out joined a cult. One player, who already played the adventure, came up with the idea of playing a pathfinder guiding the characters. (And why would a player want to replay an adventure? Because of the <i>sensation</i> the adventure's setting brought combined with my game mastering.)<br/><br/><i>Cementing through</i> the use of goals. This makes the players believe that it's what they want when it's really the adventure itself that controls what they strive for.<br/><br/>So what should be cemented to not make the characters run away and contact the police in <b>Call of Cthulhu</b>?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437239/#Comment_437239" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-14T08:38:43+00:00" title="August 14, 2014  8:38AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 16, 2014 11:56AM by Rickard.">edited November 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<h4>Delegation aka Letting the Players Take Care of It</h4>\nI remember when I was in my teens and the players started out imprisoned. I thought out thirteen different ways of fleeing. The players did the fourteenth. That made me realize that some things shouldn't be prepared. I noticed that if I ever had a solution to a problem I threw in front of the players, then the possibility for me to block the players' ideas would increase. Why didn't I like that the game master should come up with the solutions to skill contests in <b>D&amp;D4</b>? Yeah, you probably understand my answer to that.<br/><br/>So I only come up with the problems, but never the solutions. When I read about bangs, I got the similar notion. Only throw in bangs at the players. See how they react. React, in order to take a stand where your character is. It's one way of helping out the portrayal of the characters. When I prepare a sequential story, I do that to bring a sensation to the players, but they can also give themselves a sensation by portraying a character. Nothing in my preparations hinders the players, but on the other hand - unlike bangs - it doesn't help either. On the other hand, you could cement personality traits or relations between the characters if you want to put focus on either reacting through personality or creating relationship drama.<br/><i><br/>Letting the players take</i> the responsibility of portraying their character. This will add to the general atmosphere for the session. You do however need the players to buy into this way of playing. That's why I used the word "responsibility".<br/><br/>So what does this have to do with sequential play? The immerse experience through the sensation of another person's perspective got nothing to do with it(?), but the not thinking up solutions do. Even if a scene is bound to happen, when I game master, the players can still choose from where to enter that scene and where to end it. I will leave that up to them. When I play <b>Feng Shui</b>, it's going to start with me cementing some goals through the fight at the beginning of the session and then let the players take their own way to the fight in the end. Sometimes I got scenes to throw in, assembly style, sometimes I got a pure ballistic play where the players have a picture frame to paint whatever they want, as long as they are inside the frame.<br/><br/><i>Letting the players come</i> up with ways to come to the end. This will ease the burden for you as a game master, and let you having less prepared.<br/><br/><b>This Is Pulp</b> is collaborative storytelling, but it's also ad hoc linear play. All the participants will make up tropes - People, Rumors, Events, and Places - as P.R.E.P. The players then form together a goal to follow, based on the tropes, and the game master then uses all this to come up with a antagonist. That person then frames scenes using the tropes to create dangers for the characters. The players can do anything to overcome the danger but only affecting what's happening in the scene. The game master will still steer the character, and the story, towards ending with a fight between the antagonist and the characters. The game takes 1,5 hours to play so it's not like you need diversity in how the frames are set.<br/><br/><i>Letting the players take care</i> of coming up with the solution of the problems they are faced with. It will make the game master more open to the players solutions but also make them more involved.<br/><br/><i>Letting the players take care</i> of coming up with their own goals. In Svavelvinter, I can see the game master saying "Hey, you're going to fight an evil cult. I want you to come up with reasons to why you want that cult destroyed". It's their decision, but based on your premise.<br/><br/>[edit] Changed "linear play" into "sequential play" when I used it as an umbrella term for linear, assembly, and ballistic play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437253">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437253/#Comment_437253" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-14T11:36:29+00:00" title="August 14, 2014 11:36AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 14, 2014 11:45AM by 2097.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, how about renaming the thread to include sequential play, like:\n<blockquote>I go with either linear play (prewritten places of interaction followed in one order), assembly play (prewritten places of interactions that can be executed in any order) and ballistic play (prewritten start and finish, with the players doing whatever inbetween),</blockquote>\nnot just illusionism.

Playing out a story in roleplaying games is done through scenes, where a new scene occurs when there is a (significant) change in either place or time. There are two types of scenes: resting and delayed.  The resting ones wait until the characters done something but occurs instantly, like when they entering a place, visiting a person, triggering a situation, or fulfilling any other kind of requirements. The delayed scenes will happen no matter what the players do but will show up later. Something will happen after the second day has passed or they will be contacted by an organization because of the character's (cemented) agenda.<br/><br/>In previously mentioned Svavelvinter, the characters got hold of an old artifact sword. This triggered the awakening of a skeleton king. During any point of the adventure, the king will step in, grab the sword and go away. (It was a setup for the metaplot later to be revealed.) I played Svavelvinter because I wanted to try out my now published game <b>Matin\xe9</b>. The characters got involved in a skirmish, and the game system said that a combat should come to an end after 5-6 turns, otherwise the game master had to narrate it's ending. Again, a skirmish. The possibility that it was going to end in 5-6 turns was slim. So when it was time for me to end the combat, I remembered that the skeleton king wanted his sword back. A huge army of skeletons flooded the battlefield, making all participants flee or be killed. A huge knight with an old armor covered with cobweb went up to the character that had the sword, looked at him, took the sword without a word and went off. I could had done this scene at any time, but here seemed an appropriate moment.<br/><br/><i>Shifting can only occur</i> with the right type of preparations. Placing a band of bandits in one place will make them fixed. Having a band of bandits to throw in at any time, that's shifting. Having events waiting to happen at the right moment, that's shifting. The players will still go through the scene, but when you feel it's appropriate. I talked about three different styles of structures within sequential play: linear, assembly and ballistic play. This is one part of assembly play, where you got a lot of scenes but they can occur in any order.<br/><br/>What I find is interesting is that I tend to use shifting while playing other forms of play structures, like collaborative storytelling or an open-ended fish tank. The fish tank is a model where the relations between factions (an umbrella term I use for events, items, people and groups) ARE the scenario. It's used to play out mysteries and intrigues, and the players discovers the story by having the game master reveal the relations. I use the revelation as a reward for interacting with other people. When the players talk to someone, I look down at the relationship map that is so typical for the fish tank, I choose one or more relations to be revealed and also come up with a reason of why the person knows that relation. Someone can always have heard of another relation in form of a rumor.<br/><br/><i>Shifting can be used</i> to adopt to the players' plans and actions to reward them. Make them feel smart. Make them feel like they contributed with something. Never take that feeling away from them.<br/><br/><i>Shifting can be used</i> to add twists. Playing out a large battlefield between humans?

Thanks for the formalized write up.\n<blockquote><h4>Shifting</h4>\n<i>Shifting can only occur with the right type of preparations. </i></blockquote>\nI just wanted to add that <b>foreshadowing</b> is a powerful element of these preparations.<br/><br/><i>Show Signs of Impending Doom</i> from AW is a great example of a setup for a shifted scene.<br/><br/>Sometimes you can foreshadow via  a cemented scene which introduces the potential problem, but doesn't resolve it.<br/><br/><i> The adventurers come across a village burned to ash and giant claw prints in the ground. </i> Now tension has mounted and being attacked by a dragon while in this area is plausible as a shifted scene.<br/><br/><br/>Sometimes you can meta-foreshadow via the mechanics, sometimes known as Fail-Forward.<br/><br/><i> John (the player) rolls a critical failure on his detective's investigate check to investigate the Mafia family...but the GM still gives him all the information he needed. </i> What actually happens is that the die doesn't determine whether he succeeds or not, it determines what the consequences are. Now the GM secretly knows that the Mafia family was aware of the investigation, has all of John's information, and will use their influence to get him fired from his job (and thus investigative resources, <i>take away their stuff</i>). The key element is that it doesn't matter whether John's CHARACTER knows that he messed up the investigation, it matters that the PLAYERS know because it heightens drama. The character might not know that the Mafia has influence over the police until much later.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437399">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437399/#Comment_437399" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-16T07:45:54+00:00" title="August 16, 2014  7:45AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 16, 2014 10:34AM by Rickard.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, foreshadowing is something I use a lot and it's one part of cementing (but is it foreshadowing always a part of cementing?). Whenever I do sequential play, I think of the end and try to place elements of it at the beginning. Something <b>Feng Shui</b> did in their intro adventure, that was really smart, was using a named henchman to represent the Bad Guy as a foreshadowing. He and his motorcycle crew came in and wrecked the bar. I've played that intro scenario many times with a bunch of different people, and at one point the players caught the henchman. They believed that they had messed up the adventure, thought they outsmarted me, and wanted to see how I fixed it. I went with that feeling. Love it when the players think they outsmarted me (they can't because I'm going with their plans but I never rub it in their faces. This usually only happens when different expectations of the same "playstyle" collides). It's a kind of shifting doing that, and it's something I brought with me into collaborative storytelling and fish tanks as well.<br/><br/>It's interesting that you mentioned game rules, because that's a notion that I wanted to add to all of this. Cementing, shifting and letting the players take care of it can also be found in a game system. In <b>Matin\xe9</b>, it doesn't matter what the players do - the game system forms itself after the players. Shifting. The moves in <b>Apocalypse World</b>, like you said, shifting. Letting the players take care of it can include doing their own dice rolls, making them come up with aspects, having them creating backgrounds, framing scenes for themselves to activate keys, writing beliefs, and much more. Cementing is buying skills (I actually see skills as a form of foreshadowing), having a certain skills to form the experience (Stewardship in <b>Pendragon</b>, individual moves in Apocalypse World), the choice of kin, powers and so on.<br/><br/>What I would like to highlight with this is that there are major similarities in how to structure an adventure as in how it should come out in play compared to how to design a game system. Creating a game system takes structures, in form of game mechanics, and creating a story takes other kinds of structures, often in form of techniques. The thought you probably have is that a game system also consist of techniques. Yeah, and story structures can also have game mechanics. That's why I disagree when <a href="/forums/profile/liblarva">@liblarva</a> said "If there's no 'game' in a 'storytelling game', then it's no longer a storytelling game". You need a set of structures to create a story, so in a roleplaying game that creates a story, you will always have some sort rules and rules are part of the game. It's VERY important to realize that.<br/><br/>It's my opinion that designing roleplaying games should be about designing how to play a session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437410">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437410/#Comment_437410" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-16T10:32:38+00:00" title="August 16, 2014 10:32AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 16, 2014 5:27PM by Rickard.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Extra Credit talks about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0RFoGvkQfs&amp;list=PLhyKYa0YJ_5AbJCmY5GzfzJHL3acHeI_N&amp;index=3" rel="nofollow">How Much Agency Do Games Need?</a> (It's a six minute long video.)<br/><br/>Even if what the video says is with computer games in mind, I find it very applicable to what we're talking about in this thread.
