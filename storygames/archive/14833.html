With a pull quote from Gail Gygax, no less. According to the website, they have an "Official Terrain partner," LR Hobbies, producing modular 3D dungeon terrain a la Dwarven Forge. Apparently, L&amp;L made a playtest appearance at DexCon this year and <a href="http://legendsandlabyrinths.com/2011/07/07/ll-at-dexcon-overfilled/" rel="nofollow">sold-out</a> (or whatever free game slots do). Here's an overview of the <a href="http://legendsandlabyrinths.com/2011/07/06/what-makes-legends-labyrinths-different/" rel="nofollow">key features of L&amp;L</a>.<br/><br/>George Strayton himself is a screenplay writer with a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0833971/" rel="nofollow">handful of cool credits</a>. Based on a couple not-so-subtle drops in his blog, I am guessing that he's been tapped to write the screenplay for a biopic about Gary Gygax. This would explain why he's getting pull-quotes from Gail for his own game. He's also a game designer, obviously, with a <a href="http://index.rpg.net/display-search.phtml?key=contributor&amp;value=George%2BStrayton&amp;sort=system" rel="nofollow">handful of cool credits</a> there, too.<br/><br/>I'm trying to figure out if this is Justin Alexander's <a href="http://legendsandlabyrinths.com/tag/the-secret-fire/" rel="nofollow">Legends &amp; Labyrinths</a>, <a href="http://www.thealexandrian.net/dreammachine/roleplaying/legends-and-labyrinths.html" rel="nofollow">which was gonna do what Pathfinder did</a>, but then decided to become the "red box Basic Set for 3rd Edition." Probably not. And now George Strayton appears to have registered a trademark for "Legends &amp; Labyrinths," only to abandon it for the name "The Secret Fire" (though his Official Terrain partner was already producing L&amp;L-branded stuff, so we'll see that, too).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_337516">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DevP" title="DevP"><img alt="DevP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/818/nB2L0MAZS1OU2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DevP">DevP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337516/#Comment_337516" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-07T10:58:42+00:00" title="August  7, 2011 10:58AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.oldschoolhack.net/" rel="nofollow">Old School Hack</a> won a Gold Ennie for best new game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_337554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337554/#Comment_337554" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-07T17:59:49+00:00" title="August  7, 2011  5:59PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>Anyone see the big George Strayton press release for "<a href="http://eon.businesswire.com/news/eon/20110804005479/en/RPG/gamer/Role-Playing-Games" rel="nofollow">The Secret Fire</a>, which seems to have been called Legends &amp; Labyrinths before it was renamed.</blockquote>\nRe-posting my post from the snarky RPGNet thread:<br/><br/>"Hi all. I played three sessions of The Secret Fire at DexCon in July.<br/><br/>There's some pretty neat stuff in the game that differentiates it definitively from other D&amp;D heartbreakers: the wound levels, the color wheel, the way skills work, the way initiative works, and using descriptors instead of numbers, are all quite solid innovations. Where it really shines, though, is in the Energy Point system. Others upthread are right to compare it to FATE compels and tags. To me, anything that makes narration more interesting in D&amp;D-esque combat, without incurring narration fatigue, is a great thing. Because you have to actually describe how you're spending the EPs for the effect you want, like more damage or knockdown or whatever, and convince the group/the GM that it makes sense. So you can't simply say, "Oh yeah and I knock him down too" when you're done declaring your attack. But if you aren't feeling creative that round you can just save your EPs.<br/><br/>That said, there are a couple of ways in which the EP and descriptors systems, as innovative as they are, aren't yet fully thought-out, and I plan on hacking those parts just a bit when I run TSF*. <br/><br/>For example, I don't love the idea of three personality traits associated with your alignment throughout an entire campaign. I'd want them to change over time. (Easy enough to fix.) Same with the stats and their descriptors. Plus, just a personal pet peeve, I hate it when games use the big six stats but then have no way to change them. I haven't read the text yet, though I've ordered it, so maybe some of those things are in there.<br/><br/>More crucially, there's a flow-of-information problem with 1) the expectation that players will use descriptions rather than numbers in their attacks, and 2) the way in which EP are used. 1) is a problem because, as written, you have to wait for the GM to tell you if you hit or not, then roll damage, and then (presumably) narrate. This is a legacy thing that is a huge time-waster. Just tell players the target # already! That way when it's my turn I can roll my attack and damage die and then narrate the outcome right away. In fact, it could lead to some cool narration of misses, too\u2014"I aim a mighty blow at the monster's leg, but it bounces off his thick scales." (High damage roll, but too low on the d20.)<br/><br/>2) is more subtle, but definitely a failure on the part of the design team. You see, there are two EP expenditures that allow you to get a bonus to hit: 1 EP gets you a +1, and 2 EPs get you a +3. So you can, post-facto, get +4 to your d20 roll to hit. This is totally fine, but for the decision to be meaningful, you have to know the target number. I brought this up at the con and we wound up doing a thing where the GM kind of tried to make it clear through his description of your miss whether it was worth it to spend EPs or not, but it was all just a huge mess and there's a great deal of potential for players to feel robbed by the EP system.<br/><br/>Another thing we came up with on the spot at the con that I'd love to see in the official game is the players offering an EP or two to the GM's NPCs when he plays them particularly engagingly. There was this one hilarious demon that we gave an EP to, it was great.<br/><br/>Matt<br/><br/>*I'm currently planning on running it at NerdNYC's Recess on October 8th and at Dreamation in February."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_337563">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark" title="Captain_Thark"><img alt="Captain_Thark" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/674/nQDB5F77NZR8N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark">Captain_Thark</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337563/#Comment_337563" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-07T21:05:01+00:00" title="August  7, 2011  9:05PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, over on another forum, there was all this disparging The Secret Fire, but I looked at the sheet and got <i>very</i> intrigued by it, I may have to order a copy when I get some money, as it looked potentially awesome for a certain playstyle.
