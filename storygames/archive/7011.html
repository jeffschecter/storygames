What's the inspiration, the impetus?  Inquiring minds want to know.<br/><br/>Mine's pretty simple.  I spend a lot of time daydreaming, and sometimes I'll daydream up a situation that really jazzes me.  It might be a guy with a rapier fighting a pterodactyl while dangling from a zeppelin, and it might be a chain-smoking, gun-toting bear wreaking vengeance on poachers and litterbugs, and it might be a small squad of rangers in the American West with strange charms dangling from their guns, tracking angry spirits through strange, twisted forests.  Anyway, point is, a fictional situation pops into my head and I think, "Whoa!  I want to play a game where <i>that</i> happens!"  Then I look for a game where that kind of stuff happens.  If I can't find it, I invent it.<br/><br/>So, how about you?<br/><br/>-Marshall                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155936/#Comment_155936" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-10T16:33:42+00:00" title="July 10, 2008  4:33PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To paraphrase a quote: the only reason to write a game is because all the games out there aren't good enough.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_155942">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155942/#Comment_155942" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-10T16:49:11+00:00" title="July 10, 2008  4:49PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            'Cuz I see this shiny thing here, and this shiny thing there, and I ask:  Is there more shiny to be had?

The primary reason is to create a game that fills a hole in my play experience. Either I've played a certain game and it didn't do exactly what I wanted (or it did, but not reliably) or there's no obvious game out there that does what I want a game to do. I get an idea for a solution in my head and I go design it.<br><br/>The second reason I might design a game is to test a hypothesis of some element of game design theory. I have some notion that X will happen if I do Y, so I write a small game to test it. <br/><br/>Verge is full of notions like that, but I started the project to fill a need: I wanted a cyberpunk story game that did certain things.

Wrote down a list of Goals and began to crunch through what basic (sim) elements are critical to cover the most possible play situations. I am, at this point, utterly stalled for lack of playtesters--LARP systems take a BIT more time and buy-in to really check all elements and interactions, even with a "Test Plan" designed to hit everything, in as many relationships as is reasonable.<br/><br/>Pyramid games - Typically, I'm just fumbling around with my Icehouse pieces at the pub, flicking them here and there, stacking them, considering relationships... and BAM, a game notion comes out and I begin to noodle with it further. I'm at about a 40% completion rate on such games--playtesting can be hard to arrange (I have lame "gamer" friends, who only touch game stuff maybe once a month, if that).<br/><br/>ASCII <a href="/forums/profile/HACK">@HACK</a> - Was playing ToME and talking about it with a buddy, when it occurred to me that the random dungeon thing could be handled with instantiation, using resources (a la Universalis). Then, as a big fan of generic systems, I thought about how to reduce "gear and loot" to the bare essentials--DitV Traits; buy what matters; invoke however, if not vetoed (Challenges). A bit more polish and she's gonna be good to go. (Ever, the playtesting issue.)<br/><br/>For Mature Audiences - Game Chef, Ashok Desai's disturbing art, and Meg Baker's "I Will Not Abandon You" notion dialed up to 11. Add in the idea of blurring the line between character and player (Jeepish?), and BAM! FMA was written in about a day. Needs more work--might never get it done--but at the time it felt powerful and dangerous. A "dangerous" role playing game ought to have SOME niche, somewhere, I figure. Just gotta polish more (is there an echo in here?) and playtest (echo?!?) and get some AP photos of mangled plush dolls to replace Ashok's work (as he's flaked on me or utterly forgotten).<br/><br/>So the whys are several: to "fix" a lame and confusing system; just because an idea occurred to me; to move a fun game type to an utterly different medium and mode of play; to push every presumed ("traditional"?) boundary of what a role playing game entails.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_156062">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156062/#Comment_156062" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-11T08:31:18+00:00" title="July 11, 2008  8:31AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd like to design a game--or a variant anyway: "Ganakagon" combining Ganakagok with Agon because the titles just go great together, I think John Harper could make a cool character sheet for it, and I could use my Inuit, penguin, and polar bear miniatures for it.  <br/>Mel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_156093">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156093/#Comment_156093" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-11T11:03:08+00:00" title="July 11, 2008 11:03AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First I designed games only as a creative outlet, while waiting for my poetic self to awaken again.<br/><br/>As my poetry got recognition I saw that I could not stop designing games.<br/><br/>Now I design games for exactly the same reasons I write poems.<br/><br/>I really don't know why I write poems, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_156096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156096/#Comment_156096" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-11T11:28:32+00:00" title="July 11, 2008 11:28AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mel White</cite>I'd like to design a game--or a variant anyway: "Ganakagon" combining Ganakagok with Agon because the titles just go great together, I think John Harper could make a cool character sheet for it, and I could use my Inuit, penguin, and polar bear miniatures for it.</blockquote>\nAgon would work surprisingly well for going whaling, I bet.

I wanted to write a fantasy game that had the conventions of the Wizard of Oz and Alice in Wonderland, rather than Tolkien or whoever. So I did, and it was fairly successful commercially and monumentally successful to me as an exercise. My impetus was technical.</p>\n<p>I wrote Shock: because I'd wanted to play it since I first played Cyberpunk. I'd always wanted to play real science fiction, but for some reason, our science fiction games never came out that way. In retrospect, the reasons were obvious. But it took writing Under the Bed to make them obvious to me. I wanted to be able to do political speculative fiction. I wanted to talk about society inlarger-than-life terms. I <em>re</em>wrote Shock: because it wasn't communicating to a lot of people how it was to be used. My impetus was personal expression.</p>\n<p>I published Beowulf because I've always wanted to do an edition of Beowulf, the poem (I love making books. That's a big part of all of this.), and I'd thought about how to make a Beowulf game be interesting and hadn't come up with anything. Then Vincent started telling me how he thought In a Wicked Age was going to work, and I started hopping up and down. My impetus was primarily aesthetic.</p>\n<p>There are several games I've started but have been overgrown by other projects.</p>\n<p><em>The Grim Game</em> is a game about freaks, stage magicians, and escape artists who are secret agents. Believe it or not, it's based on Harry Houdini's real story. I played it with The Mountain Witch and my krewe and ... that was that! I didn't really need to do the game any more. I can't really say what my impetus was, which is probably why I didn't finish it.</p>\n<p><em>Wings of White, Sea of Grey</em> (which will probably get a new name if it ever starts to fly) is a game of sea combat with persistent characters and bargaining, so it has role-playing aspects, but it's fundamentally a game of naval pursuit in the 18th century. Think Master &amp; Commander around Cape Cod. This one is a big baffler to me. I think it needs some playstorming. The idea is that there's Pursuit, Cannonade, and Mel\xe9e. At each phase, you can win or lose, but the stakes get higher each time you come out at a draw. I need to read more about how sailing ships work and naval combat, in particular. My impetus is to get the charge I get when I watch Master and Commander.</p>\n<p><em>Xenon: Alien Science Fiction</em> Just had its first playstorm. It does what I want to do \u2014\xa0pretty well, in fact \u2014\xa0but it might be overly focused, which, ironically, makes it weaker. This one will probably be finished at some point, once I figure out some systems that liven up player/character identification without detracting from awe about the world you're in. The idea is for it to be like National Geographic, where Sign In Stranger is like the Peace Corps. My impetus is aesthetic: I want to make something like Wayne Barlowe's <em>Expedition</em> or Dougal Dixon's <em>After Man.</em></p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_156619">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kobayashi" title="Kobayashi"><img alt="Kobayashi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://zadkin.free.fr/logoBaveuse2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kobayashi">Kobayashi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156619/#Comment_156619" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-15T07:21:46+00:00" title="July 15, 2008  7:21AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wanted a game about greek mercenaries and Xenophon's Anabasis.

Of those people, I'm curious, how many of the "I had a cool idea!" games actually got done?</blockquote>For me, all have gotten to playable test stages. Of my pyramid/Icehouse games, about half get finished--often the simpler ones which are easy to test multiple times in a single play session. Of my RPGs, so far none have been published to print, though one is just some playtesting away (A@H). <i>GLASS</i> (as I said) needs a LOT of long hours in battle kit, with more than a handful of folks and a LOT of sample scenario tests and pre-gens (to spread the test plan)--gonna take me really making it a part time job for a few months and being VERY persuasive amongst LARPers in my region (or being willing to travel a lot). <i>For Mature Audiences</i> prolly won't ever go beyond its Game Chef stage (plus some feedback-driven additions and explanation), mainly because I doubt anyone would really play it the way it's intended, outside of very close committed relationships. Lacking one of those currently....<br><br><i>Stacktors!</i> is an edge-case, as it's a combination between a wargame and an RPG with a lot of abstraction because it uses only pyramids for character and challenge representation as well as mechanical resolution and rewards. Basically a minis game with questing and puzzle solving, but also with a way to do things like "duels of wits" (putting mechanics behind persuasion or argumentation RP) and "condensed" conflicts (a series of otherwise-dull tasks rolled into a single challenge). It <i>might</i> see the light of day, after a lot of playtesting, as a single-sheet, color (obviously), laminated, folding (if possible) product, as well as free-to-download PDF.<br><br><i>Three Stooges Role Playing</i> (d30) was my very firstest game, back in 1985-ish (?). Played great with my friends at the time; built to be two teams against each other in some wacky situation; very, VERY stats and rules light (think Toon with less stats and powers) but I think it would be a great con game, if I ever resurrected it. Of course, a name change (or significant IP license-wrangling) would have to occur--Keystone Kops is in the public domain, I think; or I could go generic and call it <i>Slapstick</i>, to capture everything from Buster Keaton through Laurel &amp; Hardy and the Marx Bros, up to the Nobel Three (actually Five-and-a-Half, at last count). I leave cartoon slapstick to <i>Toon</i>, as it does it so well (and human slap doesn't/can't do some of what toons can, obviously).<br><br/>Everything else--from house rules for mana (BEFORE the mana system came out for D&amp;D) to my Shadowrun 1E "system parallelization" reworks that predated SR2E's similar rules streamlining--exist only as notes and hand-drawn charts... as in, with a ruler and/or graph paper--this was before anything but ASCII-art charts and fixed-width font text was possible with a PC/C64 and my Epson printer.
