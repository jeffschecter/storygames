Let's see if I can't say something fun and inspiring.<br/><br/>I like thinking of games in terms of incentives, especially incentives for specific behaviours. I also like to think about ways of putting what are traditionally the roles of the GM \u2013 or even the game designer \u2013 into the hands of the players. I have a lot of great games to thanks for inspiration on this topic, as well as many of you.<br/><br/>My main sources of inspiration on this particular little essay are <i>Ars Magica</i>, of which I have read the 4th and 5th editions, <i>Solar System</i>, which I have read in the form of <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i>, and the Pulp Gamer podcast, which recently discussed borrowing from video games, and mentioned the troubadours in the largely-problematic <i>Star Wars Galaxies</i>. From there, my brain jumped to <i>Earthdawn</i>, which I played in the early 2000s for about 6 months, and constantly had to rotate characters, since I couldn't figure out a way to match my play-style to the way it was being run. Fiction-wise, some of the ideas come from  by Patrick Rothfuss. Finally, I credit the little election-simulation game that my professor made us play in Electoral Systems class during my undergrad.<br/><br/>Here we go: Imagine, if you will, an archetypal tavern in an archetypal fantasy setting. Humans of all lands and persuasions mingle with mysterious elves, dour dwarves, pleasant halflings, and maybe even more exotic creatures. All of them adventurers, all with tales to tell. Some adventure for fortune or revenge, others simply for glory. All of them will undergo great quests, survive great challenges, and resist great temptations, but not all of them will be remembered. Only a precious few will become legends in their own time or beyond.<br/><br/>So, mechanically, we start with a bog-standard fantasy game. Either <i>D&amp;D</i> in your preferred flavour, or something more esoteric. So long as the experience system is sufficiently abstracted, it should work. Alternately, you could, of course, home-brew. Something like <i>Burning Wheel</i> or <i>Solar System</i> where the character development is tied very tightly to the process of play has shades of this already, and so it won't work quite as well, at least not as I've envisioned it. Basically, the structure of play proceeds as normal: PCs hear of a wrong that needs righting or a treasure that needs recovering, and go out and do that. Smash smash, loot loot, huzzah! But in this little hack, we don't give out experience points. We instead track everything the characters do. Do they fight? Do they haggle? Do they perform great feats of skill or strength? You're probably going to want to hash out a list of common tasks that you and the players want to see in the game, things that you all really love from heroic myth and fiction. Break them down into as many categories as you have players, and provide some sub-examples. Try and ensure each category favours at least one of your PCs. You might also want to steer towards at least two examples, with variation in scale (one big vs. many small) and style (narrative vs. mechanical).<br/><br/>From here on, I'll work with an example, using a standard <i>D&amp;D</i> array of Cleric, Fighter, Rogue, Wizard (numerical examples obviously subject to revision based on play experience and taste):<br/>VIOLENCE<br/>Struck the killing blow<br/>Struck a mighty blow (more than level + 35 points of damage in a single turn)<br/>SOCIAL<br/>Told a legendary lie (Bluff check result higher than level + 20)<br/>Turned foe to friend (used a social skill to avoid a conflict)<br/>MAGIC<br/>Recovered a magic item (the player who actually gets to keep the item)<br/>Undertook a quest to gain magic power<br/>Crafted a magic item<br/>ATHLETIC<br/>Climbed the highest tower, swam the deepest sea (Athletics check result higher than level + 20)<br/>Swift as a shadow (Stealth check higher than level + 20, or remain unseen through an entire conflict)<br/><br/>Hopefully there's a bit of overlap there, but it hopefully won't matter too much. Clearly, everyone can potentially profit from the VIOLENCE category in this example, but some will make more use of it than others. I'm sure you can see other good examples, depending on what your group is into, like LOOT (collect treasure worth at least X gp) or SLAYER (fight at least 4 different types of monster or 10 monsters of any one type). I'm sure you can also see the problem of the fact that some of these things are going to be limited by what elements the GM wants to introduce. That's easily-enough remedied with a bit of player-narrative-control, either through rotating GMs or \u201cdirty dungeons\u201d or whatever your favourite shared-narrative tools are. Also, like Keys in games that use Keys, it's just polite to give PCs a chance to do what they have expressed interest in doing.<br/><br/>Now, play out the session as normal, and let the players track whenever they \u201chit\u201d one of these categories. The guideline should be \u201cis this something people will tell stories about?\u201d If it is, mark it. If not, move on. Be generous, and if even one other player, including the GM supports it as story-worthy, then it's in. Nobody marks experience, just accomplishments. Eager players will even keep track of the specific accomplishments as they come up. This might slow down play, as people stop and bicker over what counts as what, but hopefully it's obvious, and if not, then introduce a rule that when you do something, someone else can immediately say \u201cmark\u201d and you mark it.<br/><br/>At the end of any adventure, have a \u201cTavern Phase\u201d. Here's where things get a bit strange. You see, after the adventure, our heroes go back to their local and brag about their achievements. Maybe they even embellish them a bit! But do they impress the local bards, and thereby the people-at-large?<br/><br/>Everyone should have a group of tokens. I'm not sure of a good number here. Maybe as many each as there are players (so 4 players each get 4 tokens). These tokens represent public interest. Call them \u201cLegend\u201d for now, since it's a Legend-based economy. I'd say the GM should probably not participate in this, so no Legend for her. Each player should secretly assign a number of Legend to the categories as they see fit. They can put 0 in a category, or all of their tokens, but I'm guessing most people will spread over two. Total up all the Legend tokens contributed by each player in each given category for a Legend score for that category. Let's say in our example that we end up with <br/>VIOLENCE 8<br/>SOCIAL 2<br/>MAGIC 4<br/>ATHLETIC 2<br/><br/>Those are multipliers for the marks in those categories. Our Fighter has 6 marks in VIOLENCE and 2 in ATHLETIC, so he earns (6x8=48) + (2x2=4) = 52 experience (add an overall multiplier to make the numbers fit your game of choice; with <i>D&amp;D</i>, assuming these numbers seem like they are working, then x10 would probably be good for a normal game, or x20 for a fast-levelling game).<br/><br/>Yes, this means asymmetrical experience! But it also means that players are going to see what their fellow-players want out of the game, and chase down those experiences. Clearly, the example game has had  a VIOLENCE focus, so the players are going to be eager to rack up those kills. Character builds and play styles will adjust accordingly. Further, the next step ought to balance things out a bit.<br/><br/>During the second Tavern phase, it becomes more expensive to buy Legend score. If a given category was the highest-ranked in the previous Tavern phase, it now costs 3 Legend tokens per Legend score. Therefore investing the 8 tokens as above would only result in a VIOLENCE Legend score of 2 in the second Tavern phase. Even if the players dumped ALL of their Legend tokens into VIOLENCE, the most they could buy would be 5, and everything else would be at 0. This is fine: it represents the fickleness of the story-consuming peasants of the world, and encourages players to diversify their actions in coming adventures. The second-place category costs 2 Legend points per Legend score in the second Tavern phase.<br/><br/>If, by some incredible coincidence, a category remains the highest-ranked in multiple Tavern phases, add 1 to the cost of buying Legend score each successive phase. Add this penalty if something goes from second-place to first as well. If a category drops from first to second, impose the normal second-place penalty (2:1).<br/><br/>Clever players are going to start gaming the system, doing their best to rack up accomplishments in unpopular categories, then dumping Legend into those categories! This is good, right? I think it's fun anyway, since it's going to provide a varied play experience, and also (hopefully) tip the GM what sorts of things the players are going to need in the next adventure, to keep the points rolling in, leading to more varied adventure design. Also, if you are using dirty dungeons or a West Marches-style sandbox, the players can front-load their own ideas into the game, to give them opportunities to chase Legend.<br/><br/>It might also be fun to explain why categories suddenly drop from popular to unpopular. VIOLENCE went from 8 to 1 and MAGIC went from 2 to 5? Maybe while the PCs were off adventuring, a war broke out between two neighbouring kingdoms, and the people are sick of bloodshed, and want something more introspective and inspiring. PCs all invest in an expensive category and earn fewer experience points? Maybe the roads have been closed and there isn't a local minstrel to help spread their fame... but why are the roads closed? This helps with world-building, and gives a sense of the passage of time.<br/><br/>It also ties nicely to the Heroic/Paragon/Epic progression of 4E <i>D&amp;D</i>, because it gives a sense that the stories of the PCs are spreading far and wide, and bigger and bigger problems start seeking them out.<br/><br/>OK! There you have it. I'm sure it's got lots of little problems that could be worked out, but I'd like to hear what you think of it! And please, steal it if you like it!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_353066">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch" title="Will_Hindmarch"><img alt="Will_Hindmarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.wordstudio.net/coffee_ring-32px.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch">Will_Hindmarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353066/#Comment_353066" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-03T17:05:07+00:00" title="January  3, 2012  5:05PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is terrific! I've actually done this\u2014or something very much like it\u2014sometimes mixed with an unreliable-narrator schtick in which the whole adventure is a flashback and the players get XP not for slaying monsters but for telling the tale of it. (Players would have, under one model, gotten occasional tokens to play to have the NPC hearing the tale say, "Bullshit!" At which point the PC doing the action would have to add detail or revise their description to convince the NPC it was true\u2014this was for storytelling PvP, essentially.) I can't remember if I ever actually got around to pitching the bit to Dragon magazine or not, but whatever.<br/><br/>I wanted a whole mechanism by which players bring artifacts and trophies back and get XP for those, but I'd have to find that particular notebook to remember how it worked. I also just used a basic XP rating (slay this guy and live to tell the tale and get ## XP) when I played, but your multiplier system seems awfully hot. I dig it.<br/><br/>At one point, I had a whole campaign rigged around this idea, but it never actually got played. So, suffice to say, I endorse this idea. I'd love to hear an account of this in actual play.

It's my favourite of the bastard children of 3E. It awards XP for challenges as normal, but also gives you Renown for completing particularly hard missions. With Renown, you can "buy" contacts, reputations, and favours. It also caps the number of "prizes" you are entitled to keep, which includes magic items. It's an interesting system that sounds like it would work with your "bullshit" dice, especially if you gave your players a chance to improve their Renown award by boasting about their achievements once they got home. It could potentially also lead to them getting themselves in trouble, if they bought up their reputations and contacts to the point where they had in-story access to really dangerous information, but hadn't actually earned the XP yet to survive it. They'd have to weigh the greater risk against the loss of face if they refuse. "Ever since I heard about the time you tore the eye out of that dragon, I've known you were the ones for this job..." "Er, yeah, we can totally handle that... eep..."<br/><br/>Steve, I've only played one game that gave you XP for failure <i>(Swashbucklers of the Seven Skies</i>) but I'm sure there are others. It actually sounds like <i>FC</i> would work well with that hack as well, but give out Renown INSTEAD of XP in some situations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_353110">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353110/#Comment_353110" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-04T07:24:32+00:00" title="January  4, 2012  7:24AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 4, 2012 7:25AM by AccountingForTaste.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The original idea is interesting, but I'm liking the renown/reputation hack of this more...just because I've never really liked systems that award asymmetrical experience, especially not in high-crunch games like D&amp;D where character advancement is so powerful.

In Ingenero, you can 'risk' pointf os confidence - it gives you a bonus chance of success on something.  But if you dont succeed, you loose that confidence you risked.  Its like, only the heoric, teeth glinting confident character would try swinging on the chandelier, executing a half flip with a twist and coming down on the other side of the baddie.

It could also be used to link a deeper form of spirituality into the game if the characters are drawing their power from spiritual energies, where spirits derive their energy from fundamental concepts i the universe, while the characters are gradually restoring the balance in the world and coming to embody those concepts through their deeds.<br/><br/>In collaboration with the "XP-for-failure" paradigm which I've used many times successfully in many styles of game, I like the idea of heroic renown being used to access higher levels of power/trait, while XP allows you to actually purchase the powers you have access to.<br/><br/>Hmmm...thinking about it in that respect, it's almost like the renown system in White Wolf's "Werewolf: the Apocalypse" (I don't know if WW:Forsaken uses the same type of system, I disowned the product when I saw a lack of other shapeshifters in it.) You do the deeds, you get the tale-tellers to weave your deeds into a story for the community, the community gives you prestige and renown, if you get enough prestige and renown you go up a level....meanwhile point-buy experience pts are used to improve stats/abilities/buy-funky-stuff.<br/><br/>Nice idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354256">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Kauko" title="Matt Kauko"><img alt="Matt Kauko" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Kauko">Matt Kauko</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354256/#Comment_354256" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-14T15:15:16+00:00" title="January 14, 2012  3:15PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If a category gets picked multiple times in a row, it seems like that might be the preferred way that the group plays.

If you adventuring to recover a magic artifact, then you still get points as the fighter.<br/><br/>But I think the suggestion of requiring subdivision on popular categories would fix it a bit, too. If the wizard keeps picking "magic", then pretty soon he's going to have to deal with more and more precise ideas of what that means.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
