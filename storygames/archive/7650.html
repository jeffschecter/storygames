If they receive proper guidance during this period, gamers will stay and enter the next period, otherwise they will leave soon.<br/><br/>Excitement (2-4 months): This period is full of Enhanced Chat, Guilds, Rewards for exploring, Skills growth, Things to do, and Clear Growth Plans.<br/><br/>Involvement (2 months - 4+ years): The longest period of gamers' lifecycle, filled with Creating social events, Massive ability, Quests, Events, and New land.<br/><br/>Boredom (2-4 month):  No matter how interesting a game is, after involvemen, when there's nothing new or exciting, the gamers will leave.  If the "Guild and Chat" functions are good enough, gamers will idle in the game for a period.</i></span><br/><br/> I got wondering how and if this type of gamer cycle held true with minor adjustments and a paradigm shift to rpg and indie play?  Over the course of an evening or the course of a campaign?  Is there a way to either capitalize on the confusion or the boredom?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_169892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevin.weiser" title="kevin.weiser"><img alt="kevin.weiser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.finitesite.com/spiderlegs/wlkngI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevin.weiser">kevin.weiser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169892/#Comment_169892" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-18T11:46:13+00:00" title="September 18, 2008 11:46AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Many gamers switch from MMO to MMO trying to stay in the "Excitement" stage as much as possible, and I think this holds true for P&amp;P players too. I know it does for me, anyway. I read a new book, my head fills with all these cool scenarios and I get all giddy. Less often do I have the patience to stick with the "involvement" side of things for many games. Either the rules don't deliver on what was in my head, or some other new game has me back in "excitement" again.<br/><br/>As a GM, I very much enjoy other people's "confusion" and "excitement" phases. One of my favorite things to do is introduce people to a new game. Help them learn it, and watching them transcend from confused to excited. That's very rewarding to me.  Of course, once they're in the "involvement" stage, I lose interest, as there's always a new game and new players that I can do the whole thing over with again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_170131">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170131/#Comment_170131" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-19T11:38:12+00:00" title="September 19, 2008 11:38AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I like this.

That can come from new players in the mix or new games or whatever.

The Guild concept doesn't seem to have much of an equivalent unless it's strictly something like RPGA?<br/><br/>I'm not a computer gamer in the slightest but my understanding of leveling up online often brings new rules / quests / and types of play.  In a way, new games with the game.  Like bonus rounds in video games.

The chat is the general camraderie of that group. I'm sure we have all seen people who have lost their love of gaming but who hang around a gaming group for months -sometimes years - continuing the soldier on because if they left, they would cut themselves off from their social circle. Much the same as someone who has raided four nights a week in a MMO suddenly dropping the game and realising that they have no alternate friends. Similarly we have all seen people who we don't want to game with, but who we tolerate because of those good old Geek Fallacies. That happens in guilds as well - you associate with people you wouldn't give the time of day to normally.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170384">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa" title="Mike Montesa"><img alt="Mike Montesa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2395/2470886071_32bd4c6f2f.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa">Mike Montesa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170384/#Comment_170384" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-21T11:20:13+00:00" title="September 21, 2008 11:20AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 21, 2008 11:21AM by Mike Montesa.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Looking at that cycle and thinking about it in terms of RP and my own experience - I only ever get bored when I go for extended periods (like several months) without meeting up with people and playing face to face.
