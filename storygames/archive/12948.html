If I go any length of time without thinking about games (because my headspace is forcefully occupied by more important stuff), I become frustrated.<br/><br/>Publishing, again, is a different kind of beast. I've "published" stuff by putting it on the internet, but I'm also extremely self-critical and I rarely get to the point where I can say "Ok, this is a good game. It's good enough that I should publish it." So I have a bunch of drafts and notes floating around, for about a dozen games, but I don't feel confident enough as a designer yet to take one of these drafts to the end.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_291864">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291864/#Comment_291864" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-07T00:23:14+00:00" title="September  7, 2010 12:23AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 7, 2010 12:24AM by Johnstone.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What made me start designing?

We were playing some pretty rules heavy trad games, and I got fed up with the complex resolution mechanics and book keeping. I thought I'd make my own game to show what I wanted.  I got started, and ran a few games at a local minicon. People liked my game so I got more involved with it and continued development and went to bigger cons.  One day I realised that the game was finished and just needed polishing and then I could print it.<br/><br/>That polishing took several years to be honest, but since there were people asking for my game, and I wanted to actually complete a project I kept at it. <br/><br/>My first game was considered a finished project when I had sold enough copies to get the money back that I had paid the artist.  The game is still up on Lulu, but I don't promote it anymore. I have some ideas for an expansion, but I'm only really working on other projects.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>The current project is translating my latest dogma game into English.

I was young and tried to navigate my way through the rules for the nearly complete 2nd edition AD&amp;D.  I collected far too much and tried to synthesize all of the rules in all the published material.  I realized how much raw text was there, so I wound up building a compilation of all of the 2nd ed material that I would use in my games.  All of the kits, all of the optional rules etc, organized in a quasi-logical fashion.  As a natural extension of this principle I built a campaign world with a massive overwrought pantheon.   Got my basis editing skills and started basic digital art that way.    <br/><br/>It was a natural progression from player, to GM, to game designer in my case.   If you can't play in a game that makes you happy, you try to run one. If you can't play with rules which satisfy you, make them too.   <br/><br/>What makes a project finished?  A physical product.

I think those stories are important, too, and sheds some very important light on both the design and play aspects of our hobby.<br/><br/>For example, in my case:<br/><br/><b>Ninja Quest:</b> This is a design I started in 7th grade math class, because I was fucking bored. Loosely based on a mashup of Paranoia and Star Frontiers, as well as Fighting Fantasy books. You are a ninja, and must navigate a castle.<br/><br/>Reason: Because I was in, like, 7th grade. I got distracted by a bug or a girl or Zelda or something.<br/><br/><b>Plastic Storage Containers:</b> Another design built upon the rules of Paranoia, started in math class in 8th grade (seriously, what was up with math class? I fucking hated it, even though I was awesome at it) and pre-emptively finished on a plane trip with my family. It was an exercise in creating a ginormous character sheet with all sorts of weird shit all over it in order to basically entertain my best friend Drew. The setting was a far future grimdark world where the last of humanity ventures out to collect ancient relics then seal them within plastic storage containers. The title and concept was built loosely upon the Monty Python sketch "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IrsgnxvPwc" rel="nofollow">Storage Jars</a>". <br/><br/>Reason: I actually finished everything about the game that I wanted to (the sheet, about a page of rules). Never played it. It was my first exercise in designing based on a concept, and not so much designing for myself.<br/><br/><b>Kyuseisha:</b> This is a game I was working on for a while, but gave up on. It was going to be a Sorcerer world/supplement/setting. I started it the night I read Sorcerer and Sword, because that book fucking blew my mind. Not only was I fist-pumping while reading it, it got me instantly into becoming a hardcore Forge member, and even though it was not the intention of this supplement to breed design/designers, it did in me.<br/><br/>Reason: Ultimately, I didn't finish it for the simple reasons that:<br/>1) I could play Kyuseisha using sorcerer, I didn't HAVE to codify it in its own supplement.<br/>2) Doing so would have been a lot of work anyway.<br/>3) Eventually, I moved it to its own system, a mashup of a bunch of systems that I liked.<br/>4) But the design was fun but inelegant. And I didn't feel like making it elegant. This would have been fine for Design (and I may one day finish it), but not for Publishing, which...<br/>5) ...are two concepts semi-related that I got very confused: It was later I realized that I wanted to Publish, not really Design; and not publish Kyuseisha. I suggest people keep the two seperate. Conversations with J-Walt helped me solidify this separation completely.<br/><br/><b>Hegemony</b> and <b>Jesus Christ: The Roleplaying Game</b> <br/><a href="http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/hegemony" rel="nofollow">http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/hegemony</a><br/>Both of these were more experiments than anything. The Reason is tied up in their creation: I was inspired to develop them, and was equally inspired to stop developing them. Hegemony had more of a fun feel to it, and I'm thinking that I may continue the idea of a Massive Multiplayer Tabletop Game in another form one day, but guess what? I'm not inspired to play such a game now, so I'm definitely not going to finish designing it.<br/><br/><b>Take Back of Freedom: FIRE CHRONICLE</b><br/><a href="http://www.robo-christ.com/rpg/TBOF.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.robo-christ.com/rpg/TBOF.pdf</a><br/>I still love the idea of this game, but it is an equal-part board game and RPG mashup. <br/><br/>Reason: I need to play more board games. I came up with some great ideas, but nothing solid enough to spend the rest of my time developing and finishing it. I have some fun ideas for the game at this point, but nothing clicks quite right yet.<br/><br/><b>The Ghost Killers</b><br/>...is a game I've been "working on" (it's like my "Hollywood screenplay" for those LA-types) for years now, I think the first playtest was like back in 2006 or 2007? It was inspired by action movies, horror movies, and the RPG Dread: The First Book of Pandemonium. I started the game when Dread was no longer in print, then came to a grinding halt when Dread came back out again. Unfortunately, Dread is... well, it's in print! But no longer supported by community forums, etc (there's still some groups dedicated to it, Facebook and the like). So I've been thinking about it again. I've also been thinking about using the framework with a different setting (Edo Japan).<br/><br/>I still love a lot of ideas about this game: A sheet for the group "cabal", where pooled resources exist. Character classes ala FEAR/Japanese-TRPGs, where you choose three levels of various classes. Leadership as a powerful role, which basically gets to allocate team resources for things like individual level-ups, etc. It still exists as a mashup of action RPG and resource-management simulation (very loosely based on my experiences playing the <a href="http://www.income-outcome.com/" rel="nofollow">Income/Outcome game long ago by Andromeda Consulting</a> - BTW, if you work in a business, this simulation is seriously the fucking bomb. Get your company to get in on it), where you basically allocate resources within your team kinda like Mortal Coil.<br/><br/>Reason: Job. Life. Tenra Bansho translation (translating the work of a better designer than myself). Again the feeling that the setting isn't quite there, but not sure how to proceed. And for many of the reasons listed below.<br/><br/><b>And the best reasons, ever, for not wanting to finish designing a game:</b><br/><br/>* Realizing that it's more fun to play the games I have with others than to design something myself.<br/>* Not having a shitty job with lots of free time. Unfortunately, my job is very interesting, exciting, but keeps me busy about 9-10 hours a day on the weekday in front of a PC. I did most of my idle design-thinking back when I worked crappier lower-responsibility jobs at Duke U, Time-Warner, EDS, Cisco. You'd be surprised how many big-name indie designers have "my job is boring and unsatisfying, but pays the bills and doesn't tax me a lot" as a major reason to take up design during the day-hours.<br/>* Finding that there's another game out there that does what I want, but better (Primetime Adventures!), or can be made to do so through like a simple GM/Player rules hack.<br/>* Having a lot of fun, and taking a lot of pride, in helping develop resources for others' games, without feeling the need to "get my own name out there".<br/>* Realizing that it's a lot of work that I could better spend exercising, reading, hanging out with wife, exploring the city where we live, going camping, etc.<br/>* Realizing that there's a difference between designing and publishing. We all want to feel like a rockstar. But if you really want to *design*, then design and post on your website. Understand the difference between design and publishing, and that publishing (for money, etc) is not the Telos to the design process.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_291926">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291926/#Comment_291926" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-07T08:01:39+00:00" title="September  7, 2010  8:01AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 7, 2010 8:02AM by Levi Kornelsen.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jessecoombs</cite>What pushed you over the edge so that you had to devote the time and energy to take on designing a game?</blockquote>\nBurning time and energy on design is easier then exercising.

I try to find the time to do an hour or two of game design a week because I find that it helps me be more mentally and emotionally balanced and generally more productive in and out of work. <br/><br/>I do development on my games because I enjoy it, I've written articles on how to do it better, and frankly not enough people ask me to do development work on their games, so I might as well do it on mine. <br/><br/>I write-up and playtest some of my games (and other people's games too) because I'm interesting in seeing different kinds of play experiences. That factors into my design too, I'll often try to design something further out there on the frontier than anything I've seen before. <br/><br/>As far as publishing and marketing is concerned, I think that would be grand, but I barely what little I've attempted here has been excruciatingly slow due to lack of time. And it doesn't matter if I'm trying to publish and market a good looking free product, it would still require a non-trivial investment. <br/><br/>So that says why I start and that I haven't properly finished, after all, old designs don't die, they just get gutted for parts.<br/><br/>   - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_291984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291984/#Comment_291984" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-07T10:49:27+00:00" title="September  7, 2010 10:49AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>You'd be surprised how many big-name indie designers have "my job is boring and unsatisfying, but pays the bills and doesn't tax me a lot" as a major reason to take up design during the day-hours.</blockquote> See also: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joris-Karl_Huysmans" rel="nofollow">J.
