As a game design community, I think it's very odd that we don't discuss Game Theory.

Magic realism would be difficult to account for with mechanics that deal solely in the moment-by-moment physics of the game world (no matter how magical).  But games in which one roll or card determines the outcome of an entire scene, and players fill in the narrative - that sort of game seems perfect.  If you know you are at point A and need to wind up at C, then B can be include any sort of revelation about the inner lives of the characters.  It also would account for situations in which the narrative arc is basicly mundane events, with wild, speculative, forrays stringing it together.  Borges is my favorite magic realist.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143292">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143292/#Comment_143292" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-09T09:38:38+00:00" title="May  9, 2008  9:38AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My thoughts on this are pretty ... dense, by which I mean teasing them out individually without writing pages and pages is pretty tricky.  I will now ramble somewhat.  <br/><br/>Here's all the stuff I've read that I think is relevant:<br/>100 Years of Solitude<br/>Of Love and Other Demons<br/>Franz Kafka's Complete Short Stories<br/>The End of Mr. Y<br/>The Raw Shark Texts<br/>Kafka on the Shore (reading now)<br/><br/>I've got to read Borges as soon as possible.<br/><br/>I think that magic should always have a point, if it's present in the fiction.  The point might be empowerment of the individual, a political commentary, or whatever.  But usually magic is systematic in some way.<br/><br/>In magic realism is that it uses the absurd to situate, reveal, or pressure the characters.  This isn't done in the context of a system, and doesn't always require actual mystical events; a character in Kafka on the Shore introduces himself as Johnnie Walker and starts mutilating cats in front of a cat-catcher that has been invited into Johnnie Walker's home.  Johnnie Walker instructs the cat-catcher that the only way to save the cats is to kill him.  There's really nothing magical in that scene but it still serves a very magical realist purpose: the local cat-catcher is faced with a choice of killing Johnnie Walker or watching them be mutilated.  It's intense, surreal, and we're not told why the universe contains Johnnie Walker or how he manages to orchestrate such an elaborate situation.<br/><br/>Now, sometimes magic realist stories go off the rails and try to provide some underlying metaphysic.  That's when they're disappointing, in my opinion.<br/><br/>So back to games: I think Mortal Coil touches on this when it mentions how for magic to be magical it has to be able to surprise you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143294">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143294/#Comment_143294" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-09T09:56:17+00:00" title="May  9, 2008  9:56AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think an important constituent of magical realism is that magic is something that's not distinguished from reality. In almost every game I can think of, magic is specifically called out as something exceptional, different, and outside the normal rules.<br/><br/>Another important fact is that magic is never explained and does not need an explanation. It's something that merely happens.<br/><br/>Dungeons and Dragons: Magic using character classes are specifically set aside as having the ability to do magic. Magic may have any number of explanations in different campaigns, but the underlying assumption is that it has one.<br/><br/>Nine Worlds: Magic is explicitly opposed to reality and the order of Zeus. In practice, magic is freeform and can have a very "magical realism" flavor.<br/><br/>TSOY: There are multiple kinds of magic, each with its own rules and explanation.<br/><br/>Nine Worlds: Magic has freeoform elements, but is also bound by what the players say it is. Magic is explicity distinguished as something the players make decisions about.<br/><br/>Polaris: There's plenty of room for magical realism here. I can't think of any way that magic is distinguished from reality in this setting.<br/><br/>Bliss Stage: The dreamworld has a magical-realistic bent to it. Though the dreamworld is distinguished from reality, in the dreamworld the dream elements have a magical realism bent.<br/><br/>What would a game designed for magical realism look like?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143295">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan" title="Brendan"><img alt="Brendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.xorph.com/images/miniludie.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan">Brendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143295/#Comment_143295" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-09T10:12:18+00:00" title="May  9, 2008 10:12AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The tricky thing about magical realism is that its function for the story tends to be buried a little deeper in the subtext than in typical fantasy fiction; it exists to drive and occasionally illustrate plot, rather than as an element of worldbuilding.  Constructing a magical realism RPG would, it seems to me, mean giving the players some kind of bidding system in the metagame to allow them to create strange and inexplicable events, then playing out how the characters react.<br/><br/>Or there's always the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=579&amp;page=1#Item_11" rel="nofollow">Kelly Link RPG</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143304">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143304/#Comment_143304" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-09T11:44:13+00:00" title="May  9, 2008 11:44AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Speaking of Borges:  if you ever have or ever will play a Fortune-based roleplaying game, you must read "The Lottery in Babylon."

Much of the magical realism comes from the character's surreal emotional reactions to the real, rather than something surreal itself happening. For instance, the Zahir is about a man who loses his mind seeing an unremarkable coin and being unable to stop thinking about it. This matters I think because it illustrates another trait of magical realism that is utterly essential. The mundane itself is magical.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143309/#Comment_143309" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-09T12:20:23+00:00" title="May  9, 2008 12:20PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A Very Old Man with Enormous Wings and The Metamorphosis could both be games of Shock:.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143310/#Comment_143310" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-09T12:23:05+00:00" title="May  9, 2008 12:23PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Stoughton</cite>But usually magic is systematic in some way.</blockquote>\nActually, I don't see this at all.

I would add those who never have or will play a Fortune-based rpg to the list also.<br/><br/>Another element of Borges that I find appealling, especially in the context of rpgs, is the nonchalant way in which big sweeping ideas are introduced.  Characters will have unique/private views of a situation, but these things don't necessarily impact the <b>action</b> of the story, just the <b>perceptions </b> of one (or more) of the characters.  Like in "The Gospel According to Mark" when Espinosa <i>realized </i> that "throughout human history, humankind has told two stories: the story of a lost ship sailing the Mediterranean seas in quest of a beloved isle, and the story of a god who allows himself to be crucified on Golgotha."  The protagonist encapsulates Western history, and moves on; the other characters don't share this perception, but, for the reader, it flavors everything that happens afterward.  The malleability of truth/reality (whether physical or psychological) seems key to me - perceptions are more important than truth (or perhaps are truth).  <br/>I can't quite put together how this could work in an rpg, but I like the possibilities.<br/>Can different characters have totally different perceptions of a situation?  Not just that some characters are delusional or see things <i>incorrectly</i>, but rather that there is no objective truth, just different accounts.  The players have the benefit of getting to see all of them, and viewing the character dynamic from outside.  <br/>Sorry this is so rambly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143313">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143313/#Comment_143313" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-09T12:30:46+00:00" title="May  9, 2008 12:30PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnstone</cite>A Very Old Man with Enormous Wings and The Metamorphosis could both be games of Shock:.</blockquote>\nThat's a good point.

And Tulpa is dead-on.<br/><br/>I'd like to make a further distinction, however, since fantasy has more than one thing going on in it.<br/><br/>In stuff like, say, Robert Jordan's monstrous Wheel of Time series, magic is definitely systematic. It's supposed to work on a defined set of principles. Whether or not the reader understands them or not, they should think they exist.<br/><br/>But stuff like Tolkien or LeGuin's Earthsea books don't really push that idea. Magic is still wondrous and while both authors give the impression that there are spells and rules, no effort is made to create a knowledge of them in the mind of the reader. More so with fantasy more explicitly situated in a "fairy tale" genre. Magic creates a sense of wonder, but it's not used the same as the absurd in Garcia Marquez or in Kafka.<br/><br/>The extremes of the first type of fantasy would be the "hard fantasy" genre, while the second are more in the "Hero's Journey" type of mold.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143335">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143335/#Comment_143335" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-09T13:54:53+00:00" title="May  9, 2008  1:54PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alright, I just remembered something.

I've thought about this topic but not put anything to paper.  I've usually arrived at the conclusion that it would be very difficult to create a game that facilitated the kinds of things that make magical realism such an interesting device.  With coherent roleplaying you've ideally got a group of empathetic people sitting down to model a genre.  If you've all all bought into the paradigm, where is the room for the jarring juxtaposition?  A lot of magical realism has introspective, first-person narrative that can make for fascinating reading, but maybe not great gaming were it somehow transplanted to role-playing.<br/><br/>While I've seen mechanics that help or hinder certain play goals or genre emulation, I've seen very few that, on their own evoke the kind of moods that magical realism realizes.  I'd love to see someone attempt it.  A hacked Mortal Coil or Penny For My Thoughts might approach it.  But you wouldn't be driving towards those organic "Wow, I didn't know that about The World/Myself" moments, rather, "Of course the world is that way, but what does this mean?"<br/><br/>John Crowley's Little, Big is closer to Fantasy than Magical Realism and is one of my favorite books.  I'd love to play a fairy tale that felt like that book.  If someone did make Magical Realism the RPG, I'd probably despair of finding other souls who were interested in the experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143343">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143343/#Comment_143343" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-09T15:09:29+00:00" title="May  9, 2008  3:09PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: tony dowler</cite>I think an important constituent of magical realism is that magic is something that's not distinguished from reality. In almost every game I can think of, magic is specifically called out as something exceptional, different, and outside the normal rules.</blockquote>\nYeah, this is how Fantasy works. Magic is "additive" or "extra" to the reality of the situation. Even in fairy tales. Vasilisa's mother gives her a magic doll that does her chores for her, but it's explicitly clear that this is exceptional, given Baba Yaga's reaction to it later on.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: tony dowler</cite>Another important fact is that magic is never explained and does not need an explanation. It's something that merely happens.</blockquote>\nTrue to one degree or another. The Old Man's Enormous Wings aren't magical in and of themselves - the doctor examines them - but there is no explanation of why he has them. On the other hand, the spider-girl has a reason for having the body of a spider. She has an explanation, the Old Man doesn't.<br/><br/>Kafka is the one who just throws the absurd down in front of you. The Metamorphosis isn't about Gregor becoming an insect - it's about the family's reaction and his relationship to them. They don't react the way a family would act to a person suddenly becoming an insect. They don't wonder about it at all, or try to investigate what is wrong. They behave as if he had some incurable, socially embarrassing illness. Note they don't call the doctor or take him to the hospital across the street. They shut him away in his bedroom, and don't talk about it. The transformation is so absurd in order to bypass the reader's prejudices - if Gregor had some specific illness, the reader would immediately (re)create the situation in his/her head, and decide on their own reaction. Which means they don't examine the characters with an open mind. But because he has turned into an insect, which never happens in real life, the reader has to accept the family's reactions without their own ideas of how the situation should be handled.<br/><br/><br/>How to game these moments? Do you need to use tokens in Mortal Coil to introduce magic? That might work - whenever you want to introduce something magical, or address it directly, you need to expend a token. Otherwise, you have to narrate only "normal" or "realistic" reactions and happenings.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143347">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143347/#Comment_143347" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-09T15:24:39+00:00" title="May  9, 2008  3:24PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnstone</cite>That's not a system, that's a value judgment.

Saruman say, healing Grima's wounds or creating a bunch of forest to burn wouldn't make sense because the magic all relates back to good &amp; evil (although I know there's a nebulous 'dangerous nature' third angle).  <br/><br/>To me that's an implicit system, even if it's never the subject of direct discussion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143348">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143348/#Comment_143348" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-09T15:28:43+00:00" title="May  9, 2008  3:28PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 9, 2008 3:30PM by Jogesh EZ.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            X-posted with Ryan.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnstone</cite>That's not a system, that's a value judgment.

No.</blockquote>\nI think ignorance of the methodology isn't the same as there not being a methodology. It's pretty clear (from the LotR books) that Saruman's and Gandalf's magic are tied to and developed from the wizard society (or outside of the books, the fact that they are supernatural beings), they are reverential and powerful figures.  Every bit of magic is weighed down with importance, imporance that isn't just reflected by the reactions of characters, but also the world itself. The wizards, Sauron, witch kings, the ring, Aragorn's sword, the elven connection to the world - everything has a resonance and great import, and a reason and logic behind their inclusion.<br/><br/>In magical realism, the magical is secondary to mundane concerns. If there's any awe or importance, it's only from certain characters, and it's fleeting. Despite it being rare, or unique, it's also never really explained. If Lord of the Rings were retold in magical realism, the Ring's threat to the world and ability to make Bilbo invisible would be secondary to the fact that it's extended his life so now he has to organize a 111th birthday party for a whole host of neighbors and relatives that he barely tolerates. Oh, and look, now here comes that doddering old magician, taking an odd interest in the jewelry, ruining the retirement plans. The idea that anyone made the ring intentionally, much less to "rule them all", wouldn't even enter into it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143355">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143355/#Comment_143355" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-09T16:34:15+00:00" title="May  9, 2008  4:34PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Stoughton</cite>To me that's an implicit system, even if it's never the subject of direct discussion.</blockquote>\nTo a certain degree I'll buy that, but on the other hand, I don't see their abilities being revealed beforehand, so that later on in the story the reader can see how the system allows a character to perform magic. It seems like when Gandalf uses magic it's like, "oh, he can do that, too" and not "oh, I see how that works." Now, I'll buy that the system revolves around magic being a supernatural extension of the character's personality - Gandalf does good, Sauron does evil, Saruman's magic has changed from beautiful to corrupted. But in both Tolkein and LeGuin, the magic system isn't present enough that the author can't just make up whatever later on in the story, as they need it. Granted, it's been a while since I read these, although when I reread the first Earthsea book a couple years ago, the magic felt really deus ex machina and I really got that Hero's Journey feeling, and I think that is more important, and more prevalent, than any implication of a system. The explanation of a methodology after the fact doesn't mean there was one to begin with.<br/><br/>Well... I'm not convinced yet, at any rate.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alvin Frewer</cite>In magical realism, the magical is secondary to mundane concerns.

The girl who was turned into a spider in A Very Old Man is explained as much as the supernatural in Tolkein or LeGuin. Sure, I agree magic realism addresses the story's theme directly, but it isn't always like Gregor's metamorphosis, nor is it always rare - take The Circular Ruins by Borges, which is all magic, all the time. It addresses the story's theme, though, for sure.<br/><br/><br/>I'm running into the question of whether we should separate which authors we're talking about here. I'm pretty short on Borges and Garcia-Marquez, not having read that much, so I dunno how far I can go into Latin American Magical Realism roleplaying. The rest of your list, Ryan, I haven't read.

Magical realism tends to avoid making any sort of real world sense, but within the narrative, it often happens for thematically and emotionally coherent reasons. The layers of fiction and metafiction in Tlon, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius do not shift randomly, but with an underlying thematic reason. This is where the sense of believability comes from. It activates our suspension of disbelief by being completely thematically reasonable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143373">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143373/#Comment_143373" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-09T22:01:18+00:00" title="May  9, 2008 10:01PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Likewise with what Tulpa-Veles said, in the Metamorphosis Gregor's transformation is absurd, but isn't treated that way in the story.

That's the way they teach Magical Realism in college. Now, if we get picky about it, Borges writings precedes Magical Realism by a number of years (and this applies to Kafka, also). In general, I think that's neither here nor there for the purposes of this thread, but there's seem to be some confusion on the ideas, and rightly so, because what Garc\xeda M\xe1rquez does is really different in literary terms than what Kafka or Borges do. Kafka and Borges are precursors to Magical Realism, but if you're looking for "vanilla" MR, you might want to check some selected works by: Juan Rulfo, Carlos Fuentes, Gabriel Garc\xeda M\xe1rquez, Julio Cortazar, Jos\xe9 Donoso and G\xfcnther Grass, to name a few.<br/><br/>And I would really put my money on Shock for doing Magical Realism stuff, but you would need to tweak the engine just right. But that's not the only way to do it, obviously, and there could be great potential in a RPG that could actually do magical realism.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143378/#Comment_143378" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-09T23:27:12+00:00" title="May  9, 2008 11:27PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ren\xe9 L\xf3pez,<br/><br/>I think Shock: would work excellently for this Magical Realism stuff.

As a reader, you can pretty much read Bulgakov and Kafka, or even contemporary writers, such as Goran Petrovic or Jonathan Safran Foer, in the key of magical realism. However, once you try to analyze all those texts together, you get all sorts of confusion, as you can see from this thread.<br/><br/>By the way, I can't really see how Universalis would work for this sort of stories. Mortal Coil sounds like the complete opposite of the spirit of magical realism. <br/><br/>As for Shock: I think the main difference to take into account, is that magical realism doesn't introduces a shock in the sense that game uses it, and the nature of the story is not about changes in society. However, as in the game, the fantastic element serves as a metaphor for something else. Usually, the effect is personal, not social.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jason" title="jason"><img alt="jason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/741/nSSKWSOUO6KV7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jason">jason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143408/#Comment_143408" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-10T16:56:58+00:00" title="May 10, 2008  4:56PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 10, 2008 4:57PM by jason.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've had this very subject on my mind for some time now for <i>The Fifth World</i>.

For <i>The Fifth World</i>, I want to strike a balance between the two, with reference to oral tradition, but magical realism updates that with post-colonial synthesis of modern and traditional inputs in a post-colonial context.

But that's really just by virtue that it doesn't prevent them from occuring. There's nothing particularly about Universalis that would lead it to facilitate this sort of play. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not sure I can see what would, at all, facilitate this sort of play. The best I've seen so far is a system like Shock that asks you to come up with some situation (which could be magical), and then gives you a way to examine the ramifications. Other than this, what sort of behaviour has to be facilitated? <br/>\n<br/>\nSure, we can point out that games in which magic is intentionally dealt with in a non "Magical Realism" way, are bad, but that doesn't tell us what's good. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the Tolkien front, it's not that it's good or evil, but there definitely are rules to magic in that world. I think that I can understand now a differentiation between "Fantasy" and "Magical Realism." To say that magic is not seen as normal explanation of how the world works in fantasy is to miss the mark. To the inhabitants of a fantasy world, magic can be quite normal. Completely unquestioned as to how things work. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut in such a world, in fact, the inhabitants believe that magic is, in fact, how the world works. That is, magic is supernatural. In magical realism, it would seem that the inhabitants find magic to be entirely natural. Gregor turns into a bug? Why that's distressing. No thought as to why, or what the meaning of such a transformation is. Is Gregor cursed? Did he offend the gods? Has he been inhabited by some spirit? Nobody asks what the supernatural agent is behind Gregor's affliction. In a "magical" world, even if this happens every day, the people will think that there's a reason for it, and have an explanation. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems to me, from what I read above, that the "magic" in magical realism exists solely to create situations to ask questions. Not as a statement about the nature of the world in question, which could be maundered about in and of itself. <br/>\n<br/>\nIs that accurate? <br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, it sounds interesting, this Magical Realism (Metamorphosis is the only piece I've read, apparently), and I could see playing a little with it. But I'm very fond of fantasy, and exploring the meaning of magic specifically. Going beyond "magic as a tool" in D&amp;D, and looking at "what is it we believe, and why?" Facilitated by the work of folks like Tolkien and Greg Stafford. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf that helps illustrate at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143472">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143472/#Comment_143472" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-12T07:32:23+00:00" title="May 12, 2008  7:32AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>In a "magical" world, even if this happens every day, the people will think that there's a reason for it, and have an explanation.</blockquote>\nAnd the story would be about the quest to find the magic to undo the transformation and put things right, rather than a study in humanity where maybe things weren't so right after all.<br/><br/>"A book must be an ice-axe to break the seas frozen inside our soul." -- Franz Kafka                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143480/#Comment_143480" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-12T08:41:00+00:00" title="May 12, 2008  8:41AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well said.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd like to think that fantasy play doesn't obviate play that regards humanity, insteal allowing both that and other metaphysical flights of fancy.

I was just pointing out that in a fantasy story an event like waking up as a bug would tend to lead to a story about the undoing of the metamorphosis by finding its cause and reversing or removing the magic. That is still a tale about humanity, but humanity striving toward a goal. Kafka's work focuses on alienation among family members and societal relationships with the transformation acting to bring those issues to the fore (at least it can be seen in that light). It doesn't deal with the transformation much except to show its effect on the people closest to Gregor.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143662">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143662/#Comment_143662" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-13T06:08:39+00:00" title="May 13, 2008  6:08AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wasn't responding to an accusation, just saying why I like fantasy over magical realism (taking on one obvious possible objection). <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144194">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144194/#Comment_144194" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-15T11:43:43+00:00" title="May 15, 2008 11:43AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ryan,<br/><br/>You're right: Land of Nodd could definitely work for magical realism. The connections between story elements could very easily be used to model weird magical causality, or the lack thereof (like where a flower on one character's windowsill dies because another character's mother started working for the government). You know how things that are normally completely unrelated in real life actually ARE causally linked in magical realism stories. If you treat story elements as thematic or symbolic, abstract things, you could really get a weird magical realism vibe going on. <br/><br/>The only danger is that the stories will tend to be mysterious. There are two solutions to that, however: <br/><br/>1) The players assume more of an omniscient narrator sort of stance, and explain the connections as they play (like with the flower dying, it wouldn't happen mysteriously, but accompanied by a clear narration by the current Narrator, explaining its significance).<br/><br/>2) The players are OK with the concept that these links and coincidences will be explained later, as the story unfolds.<br/><br/>Cool thread! (Definitely go read Borges. My favourite is, "Philippe Menard, author of the Don Quixote".)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144249">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144249/#Comment_144249" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-15T14:09:02+00:00" title="May 15, 2008  2:09PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I totally didn't read The Wind Up Bird Chronicles as magical realism, interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway I'm interested in Paul's suggestion that a magical realist game could be too mysterious, I think that is exactly what you'd seek, because in magical realism explanations for the unusual are not important. It is part of the sensation that you would want to capture that things happen, which are mysterious, and cause amazement, but which are not the point of the story, and which don't need to be explained, they just happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me Shock doesn't seem like the right system, because it spotlights the weird, and its consequences, instead of the weird just being something that happens in the background to frame a story. Indeed in many magical realist stories its not even clear what the weird thing is, because something strange or fantastic will happen, but then a character will explain it away in a few words as being unimportant and concentrate on something quite different. In my (limited) experience of playing Shock the story focuses on the weird things more than the characters you are playing with.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I'd want is something that captures that shifting sense of overlapping narratives, of strange things happening that redefine how you see the world, and yet are just background to what you are doing. It's to an extent something I wanted Solipsist to do, and which it *can* do (but isn't guaranteed to do).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144331">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144331/#Comment_144331" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-15T18:18:16+00:00" title="May 15, 2008  6:18PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 15, 2008 6:20PM by Tulpa.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh my!

I could see easily hacking The Committee For the Exploration of Mysteries to distance it from the pulp Baron Munchausen gaming it provides towards something more suited to magical realism. It already has the core of connecting story elements and making them recur. Most other things would need to be reworked or redefined, but it would be an interesting hack for me to try. This genre is one of those things that feels like it would be well suited to GM-less, too!<br><br>Here's the thing: A lot of magical realism is written in short story and novella form. Longer works are often filled with magical realist anecdotes that are all linked together thematically, but not directly connected. The Committee already works in favor of this in that play is centered around the characters telling their personal anecdotes. Maintaining this emphasizes both the personal views of characters AND the connected episodic nature of the genre.<br><br>EDIT: This idea of hacking the Committee is largely caused by Paul T's last comment.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153032/#Comment_153032" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-25T18:47:02+00:00" title="June 25, 2008  6:47PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I certainly like some of the ideas discussed on this thread, in particular the idea of magical or impossible events that require no underlying metaphysic (and, indeed, are not expected, by the players, to have one.)<br>\n<br>\nA game where you know, from the beginning, that anything magical doesn't make sense and doesn't have to means that clever players are less likely to look for rules loopholes or ways to cheat the system. <br/>\n<br/>\nIs there anyway that these impossible events could serve as a benefit for players, inviting them to invoke moments of weirdness, rather than simply some excuse the GM has to pour down some punishment for no explanable reason?                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153100">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153100/#Comment_153100" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-26T08:23:18+00:00" title="June 26, 2008  8:23AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, with Mortal Coil -style fact economies, totally.

Ironically, I was writing about this sort of thing at about the same time this thread started.  Here's a few excerpts I thought I'd share.<br/><br/>Magical realism -- a <i>mode</i> of writing, rather than as a depressingly culture-limited literary category -- is what I write.  For a more commonly-available and thus more useful example, it's what Neil Gaiman writes much of the time, IMO.  \n<blockquote><br/><b>Magical realism aims to seize the paradox of the union of opposites and is characterized by two conflicting perspectives, one based on a rational view of reality and the other on the acceptance of the supernatural as prosaic reality</b>.<br/><br/>Magical realism differs from pure fantasy primarily because it is set in a normal, modern world with authentic descriptions of humans and society and involves the amalgamation of the real and the fantastic. It offers a world view that is not based on natural or physical laws nor objective reality, but is not separated from reality, either.<br/></blockquote>\n((I've been using this term for a while now for my own writing because I dislike "urban fantasy" as categorical heading -- a feeling that shifts to outright loathing when it tries to associate itself with stories I've written -- my publisher is still at odds with me over it.))<br/><br/>Now, I will freely grant that British-born, Minnesota-living Gaiman isn't writing magical realism by a literary grognard's definition of the term -- calling it Magical Realism doesn't obey the 'rules' of the official definition, but more the mindset. <b>I don't think of it as a genre as much as <i>mode</i> of storytelling</b> -- creating a story with two conflicting perspectives, one based on a rational view of reality and the other on the unblinking acceptance of the supernatural. <i>Anansi Boys</i> - with Fat Charlie and Spider representing the two views - is a really easy example, but there are many others.<br/><br/>Writing that kind of story -- has a 'gotcha' that causes me a fair bit of stress during rewrites. I'm not going to be able to sum this up in a very tidy package, but here goes:<br/><br/>[All the following is my opinion, naturally.]<br/><br/>There are two ways you can approach the Fantastic in a story, regardless of the setting: there's the 'magical' way and the 'fantasy' way.<br/><br/>The <i><b>fantasy</b></i> way is the most common, I think; especially in any book series where you learn more and more about the world in which the story is set. Basically, there is magic or something supernatural in the world, and as we spend more time in that place, more and more of the system behind the magic is explained, until we know all the rules. There are lots and lots of examples of this, but Tolkien either started or popularized it, and it's carried into any number of series. Laurel K. Hamilton is one, ad nauseum. Tamora Pierce. Harry Potter, certainly. Charles de Lint, sadly. George R. R. Martin, happily. In short, fantasy stories are set in a world with special rules, but once those rules are understood, said world works in predictable ways; what I think of as the Arthur C. Clarke version of magic. (To my mind, this often takes the 'fantastic' out of the fantasy, but that's my own problem with some writers, and only really a problem when they mean <i>not</i> to do it and do it anyway.)    Clearly, games like DnD (or damn near any game on the market, mainstream or otherwise), largely follow this pattern.<br/><br/>The <i><b>magical</b></i> way doesn't ever quite explain how things work. Fairy tales are like this. Things aren't predictable, and the magic isn't ever quite explained. Some things are the way they are because that's how they <i>are</i>. You don't question it; it just is. There is a kind of childlike acceptance of the unreal here; 'superstitious peasant' reasoning. Neil Gaiman does this very well, as does Holly Black some of the time.   I think Mortal Coil can do a pretty outstanding job of this, provided the tone and setting that the players come up with leans in that general direction.  (The direction in which one will encounter <i>Stardust</i> and <i>Tithe</i> and <i>Shadowbridge</i> and <i>Coraline</i>.)<br/><br/>Please understand: I love a good fantasy. Nothing wrong with them at all... unless that isn't what you wanted. Fantasy for the sake of fantasy is great fun. Fantasy masquerading as a magical tale is going to feel flat and technical and lifeless.<br/><br/>And therein lies the danger of the magical mode of story telling. You must be very true and accurate to the participant reading/playing the story. Stuff has to be <i>clear</i> (more importantly, it has to be <i>true</i>, but right after that, it has to be clear), but <b>you can't explain everything</b>, or you ruin it.<br/><br/><b>What</b> happens and <b>why</b> it happens has to be crystalline and solid, but at the same time you have to abide by the rule of magical thinking which is that sometimes, things are the way they are just <i>because</i>, and if you show someone all the gears and connections, the magic goes away.<br/><br/>Said from the point of view of a writer: If you reveal too much of the wrong stuff, it's not magical anymore - it's just a fantasy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153213">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153213/#Comment_153213" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-26T14:39:53+00:00" title="June 26, 2008  2:39PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Doyce (and others), that makes a lot more sense of a genre/mode that I found vaguely boring and vaguely annoying a lot of the time. Obviously there are a number of ways to do "magic realism", from the "tedious description of detail" end of the spectrum to the "acid trip" end.<br/><br/>Personally, I love the kind that's in the literary lineage that goes: George Macdonald, G.K. Chesterton, David Lindsay, E.R. Eddison, Charles Williams, C.S. Lewis. (Interestingly, all of those except Eddison were Christians, yet there are moments - fairly frequent moments in some of them - when you think, "seriously, what were these guys smoking?")<br/><br/>Neil Gaiman is another who does it like them, I think. On the other hand, I can't abide Gene Wolfe and couldn't finish <i>Little, Big</i>. Not because of the writing style, or not only that, but because of the sense of alienation - the Kafka lineage, I suppose. The sense of "these people are not reacting like real people, what up with that?"

A neat angle on magical realism, Doyce.<br/><br/>I think that most of the new systems coming out of places like Story Games certainly allow a more magical realism-like approach simply by virtue of the fact that the mechanics don't attempt to model direct cause and effect.<br/><br/>I wonder if there are other types of stories we should be looking to open the doors to?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153252">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153252/#Comment_153252" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-26T16:19:54+00:00" title="June 26, 2008  4:19PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 26, 2008 4:21PM by JDCorley.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think one thing that might fruitfully be added into the mix is the "lowbrow" cousin of magical realism, the supernatural-mundane comedy combo.  By putting the supernatural in mundane situations, you get hilarity, from Bewitched through Buffy, because you recognize something familiar next to something strange, and that's just inherently funny.  Similarly with magical realism, you're aiming at contrast.  The old man with wings is great because the village is so ordinary. Hell, you can have the same effect just with non-magical strangeness put in ordinary situations.  I refer you, with great relish, to <i>The Troublesome Offspring of Cardinal Guzman</i> by Louis de Bernieres.  Even if Father Garcia never levitated, or a Spanish count never got thawed out after 300 years of being frozen, and Thomas Aquinas never came back, there's a bit of the oddball in everybody, as well as a bit of a the normal all around them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Deep, bloggy

class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are you talking about something like "The Lost Room" miniseries, here, JD?  It's something with some strong fantastic elements where they go out of their way to avoid giving any real reason why it happened (although they do work hard on having an underlying set of rules so the audience knows what to expect.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI might also mention an old HBO-produced movie called "Miracles," as an example of lowbrow comic pseudo-magical realism. In it, the lives of two characters are influenced by an extraordinary string of events (most very lucky or unlucky coincidences) triggered by a shaman's prayer hundreds of miles away. It's cute and weird.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm thinking, here. About Borges, whom I've read more than any of the authors mentioned here (except for Neil Gaiman, who I think is kinda iffy, but some of his stuff like American Gods might count)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems like a lot of characters in magical realism have a very personal set of rules which don't always jive with the real world. The same might be said of some fairy tales. Take the extraordinary cruelty often displayed by certain fairytale characters, like wicked stepmothers, for instance. It's as if they have a special set of rules all to themselves, with their own limits and weird... I dunno... indulgences? Things the universe lets them get away with that other people couldn't?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_154951">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Timothy" title="Timothy"><img alt="Timothy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Timothy">Timothy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154951/#Comment_154951" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-05T06:37:52+00:00" title="July  5, 2008  6:37AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think a key problem with magical realism, as a setting, is that gaming is social and therefore tends to involve multiple players.  These player tend to prefer to have individual characters.  The South American authors in this tradition generally, ot me at least, seem to focus on a single narratorial viewpoint and their internal reaction to the magical stimulus. How you'd break that out and get in an ensemble cast without turning it into "Chocolat" is something I can't get a handle on.  <br/><br/>Although, you know, "Chocolat" would still rock.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_154953">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Timothy" title="Timothy"><img alt="Timothy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Timothy">Timothy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154953/#Comment_154953" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-05T06:46:44+00:00" title="July  5, 2008  6:46AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, I've just had a thought.<br/><br/>I have been thinking for a long time that someone should do a game set in the bittersweet teenage years of American boys in earlier times, in which I could play "Huckleberry Finn", "Lake Woebegone Summer 1968" and "Dandelion Wine".  I'd do it, but I'm not American and so I'd muck it up.  Anyhow "Dandelion Wine" does multiple protagonist magical realism.
