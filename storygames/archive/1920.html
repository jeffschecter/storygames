                    You want a strange mashup?  Shadowrun plus the Shab-al-Hiri Roach.  It's 2070, and an Atlantean Foundation exhibition from Shab-al-Hiri has returned with a strange specimen.  The roach impresses a weak minded researcher to act as a host; the researcher incubates the young.  Slowly, the young spread throughout the Foundation, whispering promises of power.<br/><br/>So here it is, the players are running members of the Foundation's Acquisitions Department.  In Shadowrun, you normally play freelance criminal mercenaries.  In this campaign, they're all good guys backed by a large "good" organization, trying to uncover the truth about the world that came before ours.  It's a holiday, so the Foundation is understaffed, but the cast are all on the campus.  We start with Sigmund and focus on him during the game session, so everything revolves around this character -- he wants power and acts like he's more powerful than anyone else.  Xerxes, the AI that runs the Foundation, detects a biological attack -- the roaches -- and puts the entire place under lockdown.  Eddie meets up with his boss, who is infected, and infects him.  (She had the Murub card.)<br/><br/>Here's how it worked -- Roachbound acted like Flesh Form merged spirits plus it added three dice to almost all stats.  Being inhabited by a spirit adds Immunity to Normal Weapons, so there's a huge bonus for being Roachbound.  However, a Roachbound must draw from a smaller selection of cards (I think I had 18) and do what the card commands, unless he or she succeeds in a Willpower test.  They still hear the command, but they do not have to act on it if they pass.  If they fail, they must follow the command as best able.  If the task is complete or the host has beat the Willpower test, the next time they encounter a new person, they are given a new task relating to that person.  <br/><br/>Here are the events of the story:<br/><br/>So Eddie is infected, passes his first Willpower test, and pacifies Alicia, who wants to murub.  The mages come in, check their auras, and don't detect anything unusual (except that their boss really wants to murub the guy holding her in a headlock).  In another section of the compound, Richard is with two NPCs, who split up to find the source of this biological event.  NPC Amanda, who is intimately tied to Sigmund, heads to Magical Research, where the Roach first got out.  She becomes infected and is commanded to kill the original host, which she does.  Meanwhile, Richard and the other NPC heads up to the boardroom where AI Xerxes first noticed something odd.  From one of the dead bodies, a roach comes crawling out the mouth.  Richard and Amanda call the rest of the group and we determine that there are telepathic mind-controlling bugs on the loose.  A security team in hazmat clothing comes in and hits Richard with a sonic weapon, forcing him to, um, void. <br/><br/>Eddie and Alicia are infected, but the others don't know who is or not.  Young kid Shen uses psychomancy on both Alicia and Eddie and are utterly disgusted when he realizes these old people (he's 17, Alicia is over 40, Eddie is over 60) were kissing passionately.  In fact, with the sensations he got from Eddie, Shen could actually feel Alicia's tongue in his mouth along with something else crawling in.  This was right after they ate dinner and, well, there was dinner again.<br/><br/>Amanda shows up and infodumps the Shab-al-Hiri Roach background to Sigmund, saying that "she's immune".  Everyone at the table realizes this means this incredibly powerful mage is a roachbound, but only Sigmund was in the room with her and Sigmund himself didn't realize this. <br/><br/>The last major tense scene:  Eddie and Alicia are secured, Amanda enters the room.  All draw new cards and all fail the Willpower test.  Eddie must fight Amanda, Amanda must terrorize Alicia, Alicia must do whatever Amanda says.  Amanda puts a gun to Alicia's head, Alicia tells Amanda to kill her.  Eddie struggles to get free.  One player tackles Amanda, her shot goes wild. All hell breaks loose: Eddie breaks free and kicks Amanda in the head.  Amanda casts Shatter on Eddie and nearly cripples him.  Everyone tries to stop Eddie and Amanda from killing each other; Sigmund is paralyzed with indecisiveness.  Shen overcasts Stunball and knocks everyone out (very nearly killing both Eddie and Amanda).  <br/><br/>Denouement.  <br/><br/>The medical wing, days later.  Sigmund and Amanda are in hospital beds, next to each other, reflecting the opening scene. (Our first scene was a flashback to nine years ago.  In it, the two had slept together -- Amanda gets up and leaves Sigmund's apartment without any words being said between them.  They're part of the same breeding experiment and may be brother and sister, nobody knows.)  They don't say anything until she whispers, "It was so powerful.  It was beautiful."  Sigmund doesn't speak for a moment, but then asks, "Why didn't you infect me?"  Black.<br/><br/>Total awesomeness:<br/><br/>Sigmund's player hates games with mind controlled PCs, because that takes away from the player's fun.  However, with the suggestion tasks for the Roachbound, and the free will of how they could complete their tasks (and possibility of making the Willpower test to not do the task), they all liked how it was handled.  That and the insane benefits -- three extra dice to attributes and normal weapon immunity -- really worked out well.  They also liked the random cards, so even I didn't know what the Roach was going to command.<br/><br/>We also did the storyboarding thing from the "Group Storyboarding to populate the game world" thread.  Everyone loved having input onto the NPCs.  Questions asked were things like who do these people work for, and then more defining things, like asking Richard's player why this particular NPC hates Eddie or asking Sigmund's player what dark secret is this NPC keeping from the Foundation.  Once answers came out, the entire group wanted to collaborate on the answers.  Tons of story stuff was generated.  It was pure gold.  We did this a little bit with locations, but they really delved into NPCs.<br/><br/>Everyone in the group made very happy noises about the session after the game was over.                </div>

                            consider this stolen for the next Roach Mashup. I am now intimidated to even try to write up my Spirit of the Roach experience.                        </div>
