I tried to break the cycle by sitting down with a pen and paper instead of a computer, but that was just as fruitless.<br/><br/>I've always considered the design and writing of a game to be separate activities, but I think that I have done myself a bit of a disservice because now I don't know how to merge the two. I don't want my text to seem like a random, unrelated collection of rules (which is currently what it is). <br/><br/>Where do I start? Why do certain games start with setting, some with rules and some with an explanation of what an RPG is? How do I determine the voice I want to write in? Should I be formal or familiar? Should I write for an experienced player, a person who has never played an RPG before or somewhere in between. Do I write to the player (e.g. you do this) or do I write to a neutral audience (e.g. this can be done)? How should I organize my material: include examples and advice with the rules they apply to in order to aid in comprehension and application, or keep them separate to make it easier to digest quickly and reference later? In what order should I present character creation, conflict resolution, how to do stuff, etc.?<br/><br/>I know that's a lot to answer in one post, so any hints or advice to any one of those issues would be greatly appreciated.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244363">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244363/#Comment_244363" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-01T08:59:46+00:00" title="December  1, 2009  8:59AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Who is your audience?<br/><br/>Mouse Guard's audience is very different than Burning Wheel's audience. That's why in Mouse Guard, pregenerated characters are presented first and character creation rules are in the back of the book. This wouldn't be as useful for Burning Wheel's audience. It depends on who your audience is.<br/><br/>If your audience is you, then what do you like? <br/><br/>Go to your local gaming store, spend hours reading existing games, and takes notes about what you like and why. Then buy your favorite game and try running it. What helped or hindered you? Take notes. <br/><br/>Then when you know what you like, find someone else with similar likes. Maybe someone if your gaming group. Have them read and run an existing game you like from scratch. Ask them to think out loud. When they hate something, say it. When they like something, say it. When they are confused and unsure, say it. Don't help them. Stay passive. Record them. Take notes. <br/><br/>We often have a false sense of self. We likes things for different reasons than what we think. It's best to passively observe and let their actions speak louder than their words after the fact.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_244364">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244364/#Comment_244364" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-01T09:05:09+00:00" title="December  1, 2009  9:05AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Write it as though you were explaining it to a friend, in your own personal voice; this is your first playtest document.

Egads).<br/>I don't normally worry about what medium I'm writing in - a wiki, a word doc, a text file, etc... normally I just focus on writing the damn thing.<br/><br/>But when I started re-writing Perfect, someone recommended that I use Scrivener. If you've got a mac, check it out, because it totally changed how I went about writing, and it revolutionized some of the organizational process for me.<br/><br/>Scrivener divides a project into many component files, and lets you outline them before/as/after you write (with synopsis notecards), specify target word counts to those particular files, easily re-arrange the files, create a hierarchy between the files, drop sets of files into folders, re-combine those files with the touch of a button... in short, it does a lot of things, so that when you sit down to write a given section, you know exactly what you want to write, exactly how you want to write it, how many words you want to use, what will come after it... and those things are easily editable, so that if you change your goals midstream it takes only a few seconds to update them.<br/><br/>It let me create a much more intentional document. One with clear principles of organization at its core. Quickly. Efficiently. Coherently.<br/><br/>I don't think Scrivener is the place you START (or maybe it is, I don't know. I was introduced to it well after I started). However, it's a great way to DEVELOP, once you've already got all those thoughts on paper, put through the ringer, and are ready to develop them.<br/><br/>I rarely think "wow, this technology was at the center of the project", but in this case, it was. Scrivener. Look into it.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244493">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244493/#Comment_244493" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-01T18:04:34+00:00" title="December  1, 2009  6:04PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I usually begin with a document that's just notes to myself about how I run the game.  The important part at this step is write down both 1) how you actually run it and 2) how you would run it every time if you were a GMing superstar (like Brand or something) and were always super dooper awesome at GMing.  Then try to run it for people using the steps you laid out, marking where what you actually do is different from the text (never choose to follow the rules you wrote down over your instincts; that's not how people play games, though I see a lot of people playtesting that way; "let's stick to the rules this time"; when do people actually do that?!!).<br/><br/>Then throw this draft away and write it again.  This time as notes to someone else about how they should run the game.  Often I pick a specific person I'm writing for.  For the beta draft of Geiger Counter, I think it was Dev, but I don't really remember.  This is the first version you shop around for feedback and initial playtesting, generally.  Play this version a lot.  Don't write a new draft for at least 3 months to a year, though you can definitely make some smaller changes as you figure stuff out.<br/><br/>Throw this draft away.  Based on all the feedback and everything you've learned (+ a year of playtesting), write a new draft, explaining to all the folks who've run your game how they should NOW play it, since you now should know how to play it better than just about anyone, at least procedurally.  Throw it out there.  Maybe make a free ashcan or do some pretty layout.  Let people play it a bit.  If you've got all positive feedback, maybe it's time to find an editor or proofreader and start preparing a semi-final document of some kind (which might require yet another draft, who knows).<br/><br/>In general, the key thing about writing is realizing that nothing you put down is final.  Everything is subject to change until you pay a bunch of money to print it.  And that's definitely not happening anytime soon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_244574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244574/#Comment_244574" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-02T06:06:29+00:00" title="December  2, 2009  6:06AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm with Ben.

Some clever player will have an insight that you never saw that you'll want to use in the game. <br/><br/>Design is a fluid process that only ends when the game is printed - and because we print on demand it doesn't ever really end because revision is sooooo easy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244614">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chadu" title="chadu"><img alt="chadu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://pics.livejournal.com/chadu/pic/0003ch8e"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chadu">chadu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244614/#Comment_244614" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-02T09:35:40+00:00" title="December  2, 2009  9:35AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>I usually begin with a document that's just notes to myself about how I run the game.

Write a bullet point list of notes -- setting and rules details -- in a bullet-point format.<br/><br/>2. Re-write this document into (possibly two separate, one for players and one for the GM/me) short handouts.<br/><br/>3. Print-out and playtest the hell out of it. (alpha playtest)<br/><br/>4. Take careful notes on what players try to do/with system and setting, and the questions/problems they bring up. <br/><br/>5. Take careful notes on your answers and subsequent discussions on said answers for <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a>.<br/><br/>6. Repeat 4 &amp; 5 at least three times before moving to 7.<br/><br/>7. Write an actual draft -- it can be patchy/barely readable (I call this a "shotgun draft") -- based on what you've generated from the previous steps.<br/><br/>8. Playtest more.<br/><br/>9. Rewrite more.<br/><br/>10. Have PEOPLE YOU DON'T PERSONALLY GAME WITH (or even KNOW) playtest the hell of it. (beta playtest) <br/><br/>11. Repeat 10 in at least three instantiations.<br/><br/>12. Rewrite the draft from what you've learned from 10 &amp; 11.<br/><br/>13. Playtest more, yourself and other groups. (gamma playtest).<br/><br/>14. Rewrite the draft.<br/><br/>15. Find an editor. Make whatever arrangements with him or her. Work with editor. <br/><br/>16. Start looking for layout talent and artists. Make whatever arrangements with them.<br/><br/>17. Research publication and sales options. Acquire art. <br/><br/>18. Have a penultimately edited, pre-published draft. Have it laid out.<br/><br/>19. Print a galley draft and proofread. (You will still miss things; often a good idea to have someone else who's not the editor proofread, too.)<br/><br/>20. Fix the lingering problems, and publish.<br/><br/><br/>At least, that's how I do it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_244627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244627/#Comment_244627" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-02T10:13:21+00:00" title="December  2, 2009 10:13AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You've got really good questions.

The objective might be a bit different than what you had in mind, but I thought I'd share anyway.<br/><br/>The challenge was "Write a game in 2009", and the focus was: Stay on schedule!<br/><br/>In my experience a game never really gets "Done", it might get nearly done, but not actually Done. There is always one more bug to fix, tweak or refinement to make.  And if you stay at it long enough your own preferences in gaming will shift or develop along the way, making the done, complete and finished game an impossibility.<br/><br/>Stay on schedule.  The challenge used the following schedule:<br/><br/>* Start the game project, early January.<br/><br/>* Concept - Get the general outline of the game, rules, setting and form. Done the last of February.<br/><br/>* Playstorming / Writing - Get a playable prototype done, it can be simple and rough, but it should have enough down that you can run the game using it.  Run the game for some friends. Done last of March.<br/><br/>* Playtest/demo with strangers. (We met up on GothCon in April and played)  Done the last of April.<br/><br/>* Playtest by others. Play/Read/Write all summer so that you can...<br/><br/>* Send out proofs by the last of July.<br/><br/>* Get the proofs back by the third week of August.<br/><br/>* Layout and test print done by the last of September. (We had POD publishing in mind.)<br/><br/>* Review the test print and make final updates by the last of October.<br/><br/>* Publish the game in November.<br/><br/>* Market your game and review other games from the challenge in December. <br/><br/>It took a year, but by the end everyone who stayed in the challenge had a completed game.
