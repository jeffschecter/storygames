In the adventure the PCs watch from the sterncastle as 30 spectral trolls, 3 skeletal pirates and the glabrezu ship captain sail the river down.<br/><br/><br/>The PCs will be traveling from the 1st layer of Hell down to the 6th layer of Hell.<br/>What strange, creepy, neat, interesting events and spectacles could they witness?<br/><br/>Give your best "narrator" (or movie voice!!) view of the shores and waters and skies, to read aloud monologue while they travel down.<br/>What Lower Planar sights will the PCs to see as they sail?!??<br/><br/><br/>EXAMPLES (from the module "A Paladin In Hell")<br/>- Vast herds of larvae driven on by demons (or devils) and yeth hounds.<br/>- A galloping trio of nightmares racing along the terrain and up into the sky.<br/>- Winged mephits bearing ill missives.<br/>- A curious night hag watching their vessel Demonwing float past.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Looking forward to the sights!<br/>-kev-                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
