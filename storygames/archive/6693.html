(Two of them were shot back to me because the name of the event can't match the name of the system being used.  I didn't know this.  They have been submitted for reapproval.)  I'm including Games on Demand as part of the IGE events.  So far, everything looks good.  I'm going to have some complimentary GM badges to hand out to volunteers.  I don't know for sure exactly how many but it looks like 6.  Regardless of the final count, I'm essentially going to give the badges to the people who volunteer for the most hours (and who want them, obviously).  So, now is the time where I need to round up my volunteers.  Here's who I have so far.<br/><br/>Mike Holmes - Games on Demand (?? hours), Fae Noir (4 hours)<br/>Jonathan Walton - Games on Demand (?? hours), Geiger Counter (8 hours), 1001 Nights Hack (4 hours)<br/>Darcy Burgess - Black Cadillacs (8 hours)<br/>Seth Ben-Ezra - Dirty Secrets (8 hours)<br/>Nick Licata - Fae Noir (4 hours)<br/>Scott Acker - Dresden Files (8 hours)<br/><br/>**I've got two sessions of Candy Creeps too but they're the ones I had to resubmit.  I can't count them yet.<br/><br/>I know that others have expressed interest in volunteering for Games on Demand.  Here's your chance.  I essentially need all the volunteers I can get.  At the very least I need 2 Table Custodians for each slot of GoD, which amounts to 2 sessions of 4 hours on Thursday, Friday and Saturdays.  The sessions go from 10am - 2pm and 2pm - 6pm.  If you want one or more of these slots now is the time to let me know.  Thanks.<br/><br/>Andrew                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148369/#Comment_148369" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-05T09:43:17+00:00" title="June  5, 2008  9:43AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let me look at my schedule and get back to you.

TC doesn't require that you have any specific game to run.  It just means you are capable of 1.) taking up tickets, 2.) running a fair variety of pick-up games and 3.) be able to facilitate finding a spot for folks who walk up to play.  Anyone who wants to can show up at the GoD tables and volunteer to run a game at any point that the GoD tables are open during the Con.  You don't even have to tell me about that.  I'm all for it.<br/><br/>Andrew                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148404">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20Bow" title="Justin Bow"><img alt="Justin Bow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20Bow">Justin Bow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148404/#Comment_148404" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-05T11:56:11+00:00" title="June  5, 2008 11:56AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andrew, <br/>Out of curiosity, what did you end up renaming the Candycreeps games?<br/><br/>Also, it looks like there are going to be 2 more Fae Noir games, but I believe the GM signed them up himself.
