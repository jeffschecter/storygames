(I\u2019ve DMed 5e before, most notably right after it came out, using the published \u201cHoard of the Dragon Queen\u201d adventure. That game ended in a TPK, and was kinda fun, but I don\u2019t think anyone was particularly enthusiastic about the game. The following is not about that game, but I think the outcome of play was essentially the same I detail below).<br/><br/><br/>What was I hoping to get out of D&amp;D in this instance? I think I just wanted a sort of uncritical \u201cfun\u201d to emerge, how it seems to happen for people like Matt Colville \u2014 I like the widgets that D&amp;D players get to fiddle about using their characters, and I like the fantasy milieu it presents; in particular, in Eberron, which was the setting I ran my game in. I was exhausted with \u201cmeaningful\u201d games about serious subjects, which get a lot of play in my area. I was exhausted with trying to keep up with the \u201cnew\u201d in game design, and having the conversation be design-focused rather than play-focused. I wanted to have fun fantasy stories, and D&amp;D was booming, and it seemed fun to just meet an entirely new group of people (i.e., people I hadn\u2019t played games with before, yes, but also people who sort of came to D&amp;D through Critical Role and greater nerd culture; most of whom had never heard of even Apocalypse World or any games other than D&amp;D). <br/><br/>I didn\u2019t want to railroad my players; neither <a href="http://big-model.info/wiki/Illusionism" rel="nofollow">illusionism</a> nor <a href="http://big-model.info/wiki/Participationism" rel="nofollow">participationism</a> are interesting or fun for me. I wanted to \u201cplay to find out what happens\u201d in fifth edition, but it turns out that is extremely difficult to do in 5e, due to the nature of DM prep and the lack of player priority in the system. The players certainly never said \u201cI want to experience your story, Hans,\u201d and they also seemed totally fine with making whatever decision their characters \u201cwould\u201d make, to hell with the drama of the current scene, or whatever. But at the end of the day, I had carrots (because I had monsters and story hooks prepped, because how else do you run D&amp;D?), and, at the end of the day, they knew that for play to work, someone would have to eat the carrots.<br/><br/>This was fine, as far as it goes, but it never quite felt like...playing a game. It didn\u2019t feel like they were \u201cplaying through the DM\u2019s story,\u201d or like we were \u201cplaying to find out what happens [to the characters]\u201d, it simply felt like I was presenting scenarios, the players were responding to them in the expected way, and at the end not much interesting had taken place, because I wasn\u2019t and didn\u2019t want to create a story to present to the players, but as players of the game they didn\u2019t have player-priority tools to move the game in any particular direction beyond the bounds of what their characters\u2019 abilities offered them within the  scenario. I could either present a story (which I didn\u2019t want to do), or I could leave it up to play and have emergent story. Whereas OSR-style D&amp;D allows interesting emergent play to happen because of the challenge-based nature of play (i.e., the reward system), 5e has no real space for emergent play. Consider that the base rules for XP (kill monsters), is almost entirely done away with in nearly every WotC-published 5e adventure. They love Milestone experience, which is \u201cwhenever the DM decides you level, you level.\u201d <br/><br/>Anyway, I had some idea, from my previous experience running the Hoard of the Dragon Queen game, what I wanted to get out of 5e\u2019s mechanics. I wanted to run a game that forced the players to make interesting and difficult decisions, about three different things: 1) resources, 2) tactics, 3) the situation at hand, i.e., what NPCs are doing and asking of the characters and what pressure monsters and their violence are putting on the characters.<br/><br/>To that end, I modified the rest system, using ideas taken from 13th Age. The way I modified it was to declare that Short Rests and Long Rests were decoupled entirely from in-fiction time or actions. Characters earned the benefits of a Short Rest after every two encounters. After every six encounters, characters earned the benefits of a Long Rest. I was hoping to solve the problem, among others, of the Five Minute Adventuring Day, and I did. However, there was never any real sense that, even with this system, the players had to make interesting and difficult decisions in combat. Perhaps this modification could be designed to better make this a reality (i.e., more playtesting and tweaking of exactly how many encounters earn exactly what kind of respite), or perhaps this sort of play will just never be able to manifest within the system of 5e. Also, after about ten sessions, we abandoned my modification at the request of the players. They had agreed to it up-front, but after playing with it a while they disliked it. They wanted the \u201crealism\u201d of rest to work.<br/><br/>So, basically, I think 5e works well in a Participationist mode, and in no other. I was hoping for interesting emergent story from the freewheeling nature of task-resolution-oriented play, but I didn\u2019t see that happen and I don\u2019t see how it can. This feels like lessons that were learned decades ago on the Forge, but hey, I never played much D&amp;D till now, and I certainly never gave long-term DMing in the traditional style a shot until now.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_477303">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/moconnor" title="moconnor"><img alt="moconnor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/483/n3W81Z19PQYI6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/moconnor">moconnor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477303/#Comment_477303" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-10-29T01:23:24+00:00" title="October 29, 2018  1:23AM">October 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like your proposed hack.

If I\u2019m recalling correctly, we did 1st &amp; 2nd encounters = 1st short rest, 3rd &amp; 4th encounters = 2nd short rest, 5th encounter = long rest. And then the whole thing reset.<br/><br/>I have to be honest \u2013 I didn\u2019t care for it! And it\u2019s specifically because it quashed the only area where 5e really excels at facilitating emergent play, which is the in-game rest. In the groups that I run with, we use the in-world rests to play out scenes and conversations between characters. We dissect what happened previously, flesh out personalities and relationships, plan what to do next, and generally ignore all the dice in favor of straight improv RP. And then when we jump back into the action, we can react to things according to our characters\u2019 personalities and relationships. So even when events are pre-planned, there\u2019s this narrative connective tissue that goes beyond the specific challenge at hand.<br/><br/>Obviously this isn\u2019t what you were going for in the game you describe \u2013 getting an emergent story out of players making tactical decisions and responding to challenges, and allowing that and the game rules to build the narrative. I have to agree with you that 5e is just not a good system for emergent gameplay. You have to have either set up a massive sandbox to enable real player choice, or you have to temporarily ignore the game mechanics to create spaces for meaning between challenges. Otherwise, you\u2019re just shuttling players from encounter to encounter where they (especially if they\u2019re new) will never make the interesting decision when they could make the expected one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_477320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477320/#Comment_477320" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-10-29T18:40:28+00:00" title="October 29, 2018  6:40PM">October 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran 30 or so two-hour sessions of a megadungeon campaign with dozens of different players coming and going, and I didn't railroad anyone, and we had a lot of fun.

I haven't played a TON of new-school D&amp;D, but I've seen many of the same dynamics at work in the games I've participated in.<br/><br/>Perhaps the one counter-example is Adam's game (the same Adam_Dray, just above!):<br/><br/>In that game there was a well-defined sandbox, which worked to present players with choices. However, in the micro-scale, it meant that for most players and most sessions (correct me if I'm wrong, Adam!) were all about tactical decisions. You show up to play, and there's already a certain "delve" or adventure in progress. <br/><br/>Perhaps one player has decided to explore the Caves of XYZ tonight, so that's what's "on the menu". Everyone else who shows up tags along and does their best to face the challenges you all meet together. The GM is operating from a prepared dungeon, so the GM's side of the equation is basically like running a module: there's no "story" and no "balanced encounters" and it's simply disarming traps and exploring and fighting monsters and deciding where to go.<br/><br/>You show up and you make tactical decisions (which door to open, when to retreat, what spell to cast), which are fun because they're meaningful.<br/><br/>5th Edition seems to do OK in pure "sandbox exploration" mode, although I don't think it's ideal for that at all. (I prefer OSR-style mechanics, for a variety of reasons. A HUGE one is the length and complexity involved in making characters, which works against any kind of high-lethality playstyle, in my opinion - I wouldn't want to deal with that at my table.) I can't speak to how well that works at higher levels, however.<br/><br/>However, the more story-oriented games I've seen (basically, anything outside the dungeon, taking into account characters' backstories, personalities, trying to create something that feels like a fantasy novel, good guys and bad guys, and so forth) all suffered from exactly what Hans is describing. The combination of detailed character creation, the amount of work involved in preparing "encounters", the XP system, and the parts of the system which are emphasized by D&amp;D's rules lead to a fairly predictable style of play.<br/><br/>For example, consider that the combination of "XP for monsters" and the instruction for the GM to present 'balanced encounters' means that, in most D&amp;D games, the GM presenting any kind of monster/armed opposition ALWAYS means the PCs will choose to fight. That's why the game becomes rather repetitive: GM introduces a threat, the PCs fight it (and usually win, because of encounter-balancing). Rinse and repeat.<br/><br/>The main problem becomes handling the apparent level of challenge by negotiating how often the party rests. For that, you need either a very carefully-managed fictional premise (e.g. an adventure through an area where resting is hard - e.g. wandering monsters - and/or a strict source of time pressure within which you have to complete the adventure) or to accept that it's largely in the GM's hands (as Hans found). Often this isn't even because the GM is trying to control things, but because the players have so little ability to understand the stakes in play or to affect them - eventually, all you can do as a player is say, "Ok, I guess we rest now," and the GM is then awkwardly left to decide what happens and whether this means they've failed the adventure or whether she should increase the difficulty of the next encounter, or just let them go ahead and "win" easily. Ultimately, the GM will decide these things based on some combination of what's easiest for them prep-wise and what's most dramatically interesting (which means the GM is, effectively, controlling the story, to a large extent).<br/><br/>So, then, gauging how often to rest is the remaining variable (or potential stumbling point) for each group.<br/><br/>Adam's solution is brilliant, in my opinion: he has resting "erase" or counter some of the benefits of gaining XP, so that choosing to rest is something you always want to balance against your HP total (or other resources lost) and your desire to level up and gain abilities. I think this is fantastic, because it makes every hit point lost matter (since rests are costly in terms of advancement), and every healing spell used matter, which is, as far as I can tell, the point of new-school D&amp;D, and what makes it run as intended. If I ever run new-school D&amp;D, I will definitely borrow that little bit of rules technology!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_477332">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477332/#Comment_477332" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-10-29T21:56:50+00:00" title="October 29, 2018  9:56PM">October 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An alternative view to my own post above:\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" rel="nofollow">Adam_Dray</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>Or this.

If I played purely as an impartial referee, the game would lose steam really fast. (Characters that are played "realistically" tend to look for stability and safety more than anyone in the adventure media or dramatic media we tend to enjoy, and a "world" which similarly operates along "simulationist" principles doesn't help us find the "fun" in play. In practice, then, the players start looking around for bits of content which allow them to find some challenge or some action, and the GM starts presenting those, just as Hans describes: you set out some carrots, and the players eat those carrots, because what else is there to do?)<br/><br/>Either the game became rather stagnant, or I, as GM, had to constantly introduce some exciting action. Occasionally the players would, instead, by making their character irrational and desperate or by going into conflict against each other. <br/><br/>In practice, over time I could see that our best and favourite sessions where ones where the GM pushed harder and introduced drama and action, giving the PCs something to react to. The more closely we hewed to our desired procedures for play, the less fun we had. That's why I ultimately abandoned this style - it worked against itself.<br/><br/>In this view, then, it has nothing to do with D&amp;D; it's just what playing in this style feels like. (In theory terms, this kind of Right to Dream play either a) doesn't exist at all, or b) requires all parties to be focused on a particular creative premise which reaches beyond simply accurately portraying characters and a world - for instance, recreating the tropes of a particular type of media or very intentionally exploring a specific situation, with laser-like focus.)<br/><br/>I'm not sure which is or was Hans's experience!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_477333">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/moconnor" title="moconnor"><img alt="moconnor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/483/n3W81Z19PQYI6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/moconnor">moconnor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477333/#Comment_477333" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-10-29T22:04:22+00:00" title="October 29, 2018 10:04PM">October 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 29, 2018 10:04PM by moconnor.">edited October 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            These responses about Adam's game from <a href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">@Adam_Dray</a> and <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> sound great.

What was the adventure? <br/> <br/></p></div></blockquote>\nSure! And thanks for asking. Talking about specifics is definitely what will help me get to the heart of the matter of my 5e play, but I don\u2019t always know where to start or how to do that, so your direction is helpful.<br/><br/>Eberron is set after a fantasy Hundred Years\u2019 War. It\u2019s now a Fantasy Cold War. One of the Five Nations, Karrnath, unbeknownst to the general populace of any of the Five Nations that make up the bulk of the setting, has a vampire as its king. He\u2019s Kaius III, but actually he\u2019s Kauis I, who disappeared some time ago. He\u2019s impersonating his grandson. This is all setting canon, at this point.<br/><br/>How I started the campaign was to say (without telling the players anything about the nature of Kaius III), that all PCs have a connection somehow to this guy named Holden, who is in Dreadhold (fantasy Alcatraz). Players created their connections to this character. Then I said that he has recently reached out to you through magical means to say that he has been imprisoned lo these (x) years, and furthermore, has recently figured out that he\u2019s the true heir to the throne. Now he wants you to help him get free and retake the throne.<br/><br/>The first adventure was pretty handholdy, but if the characters had not wanted to go on it I wouldn\u2019t have blanched. Essentially Holden wanted them to find concrete proof of his claims by doing a B&amp;E on one of the Spy Gnome info bunkers that are hidden all across the landscape.<br/><br/>This brought them into a town embroiled in conflict, left to fend for itself while the crown of Karrnath marshaled its resources elsewhere. The PCs saw the local militia as the Bad Guys, since they were shaking anyone who passed through for loot, but I had a backstory that was revealed through play that ensured the PCs could understand the conflict at hand in the town and decide either to side with the local militia, go against them, find out the internal conflicts (one of the militia knew Holden, one was the toady of Kaius III, etc), and do anything they wanted with any of that info.<br/><br/>There were also cultists trying to summon a demon from the realm of dreams under the town, fucking shit up and stealing children away to sacrifice to the summoning. I don\u2019t remember now why I added this, but I think I felt like there needed to be more \u201cconflict\u201d and things for the characters to fight.<br/><br/>This was just the first three sessions or so. The game went a good while beyond that, but I won\u2019t write everything up right now. <br/><br/>The thing that happened, or failed to happen, was any real engagement with any of the above conflicts at all. The PCs found Holden\u2019s info for him, didn\u2019t really care one way or the other about who ruled the town and what their agenda was, killed the cultists (This was probably some of the most fun play we had, as they explored the caves and could draw on extra damage dice for free whenever they caused bloodshed, due to some \u201cpower\u201d in the caves. Of course, at the end of the caves they realized this was all helping summon the dream demon, which of course happened when they got to the end of the cave. The demon then talked about his designs on the town and countryside and sealed himself off from the PCs so he could \u201cget to work\u201d.), and moved on to the capital city, so they could meet some of Holden\u2019s other friends who were a part of an illegal terrorist organization plotting to usurp the throne.<br/><br/>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" rel="nofollow">Adam_Dray</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/><br/><br/> </p><blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" rel="nofollow">Hans_c-o </a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>it simply felt like I was presenting scenarios, the players were responding to them in the expected way</p></div></blockquote>\nThe question is why that wasn't satisfying. <br/></div></blockquote>\n<br/>I was hoping, I guess, that they would decide to do stuff about the larger situation: are we okay being terrorists? Do we think this kid would be a better king than the king? Should we find out more about the current king, etc? But it seemed basically, because of the nature of the game\u2019s reward system and structure, that all I could do was dangle a carrot to some (cool, fun) set piece that had little to do with the interesting situation I wanted to explore. It\u2019s also totally possible that I am just not a skilled 5e DM, or skilled GM of any game. I think I always have trouble making contributions to the game (5e or no) that other players care about.<br/><br/>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" rel="nofollow">Adam_Dray</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> </p><blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" rel="nofollow">Hans_c-o </a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>they also seemed totally fine with making whatever decision their characters \u201cwould\u201d make, to hell with the drama of the current scene, or whatever</p></div></blockquote>\nOr this.

If I played purely as an impartial referee, the game would lose steam really fast. (Characters that are played "realistically" tend to look for stability and safety more than anyone in the adventure media or dramatic media we tend to enjoy, and a "world" which similarly operates along "simulationist" principles doesn't help us find the "fun" in play. In practice, then, the players start looking around for bits of content which allow them to find some challenge or some action, and the GM starts presenting those, just as Hans describes: you set out some carrots, and the players eat those carrots, because what else is there to do?)</div></blockquote>\nI think this is pretty true to my experience, Paul!<br/><br/>I mean, really, I think I just created a good Situation for a Burning Wheel game, but not for a 5e game. I\u2019m not sure what a good situation for a 5e game would be. I\u2019ve given the game a fair amount of trial over the last four years, and it\u2019s rarely given me ongoing satisfaction, so I\u2019m not sure why I keep trying to go back to it. I think I feel that at some point non-old-school D&amp;D will \u201cclick\u201d with me and I\u2019ll finally \u201cget it,\u201d just by continuing to try to play. I dunno.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/DBB" rel="nofollow">DBB</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>This is kind of funny/interesting \u2013 this summer I played in an Eberron 5e game where the DM didn\u2019t like the RAW rest system, and replaced it with a modified version of the 13th Age non-diagetic rest system. If I\u2019m recalling correctly, we did 1st &amp; 2nd encounters = 1st short rest, 3rd &amp; 4th encounters = 2nd short rest, 5th encounter = long rest. And then the whole thing reset.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Obviously this isn\u2019t what you were going for in the game you describe \u2013 getting an emergent story out of players making tactical decisions and responding to challenges, and allowing that and the game rules to build the narrative. I have to agree with you that 5e is just not a good system for emergent gameplay. You have to have either set up a massive sandbox to enable real player choice, or you have to temporarily ignore the game mechanics to create spaces for meaning between challenges. Otherwise, you\u2019re just shuttling players from encounter to encounter where they (especially if they\u2019re new) will never make the interesting decision when they could make the expected one.</p></div></blockquote>\nThat is funny! Maybe something was in the air summer of 2018. I'm starting to agree with you that non-old-school D&amp;D just doesn't seem very good for emergent gameplay. I'm starting to question why I keep trying to have that experience with it. I think part of it is a kind of amnesia: I stay away from D&amp;D for a while, then I come back to look at its slick books and marketing materials and I think, "This sounds fun! This looks easy to get cool emergent roleplay and characterful decisions and interesting situations out of this game!"<br/><br/>But I can never make it work.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">@nemomeme</a>: That sounds heavenly. BTW, the 13th Age mechanic is that you get a full heal after 4 encounters. You can choose to take a full heal before you\u2019ve made it through 4 encounters, but if you do so, you take a \u201ccampaign loss,\u201d wherein the villain\u2019s plans have moved forward, or your goals are now harder to reach, etc. In Apocalypse World terms, the GM moves up the clocks on his fronts. To be clear, I had the \u201ccampaign loss\u201d rule in effect in my 5e game as well, but it never came to that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_477346">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477346/#Comment_477346" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-10-30T06:30:05+00:00" title="October 30, 2018  6:30AM">October 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" rel="nofollow">Hans_c-o</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Was this RtD play?

It could be, but to me that looks more like a narrativist game - I could see that whole set-up in a e.g. <i>Shadow of Yesterday</i> scenario easily enough.<br/><br/>The bit that jumps at me is that there doesn't seem to really be much concrete fictional content that excites any of the individual players just for its own sake. I get that you like Eberron in the abstract, but the actual process of play perhaps doesn't moment to moment let you delve into the interesting bits and entertain yourself by giving the players zealous speeches about its finer points, which is something that I would expect from simmy D&amp;D.<br/><br/>For comparison's sake, we played another session of our Prydain D&amp;D campaign this Sunday. I as the GM was rather entertained by the adventure's premise: the nephew of the High King had been nefariously murdered while in the care of the Bard College of Prydain, which was a political problem, because the College is internally independent and there was a serious clash of jurisdiction when it came to actually investigating the murder. Explaining the history and sociology of how all this came to be, and the potential consequences of a permanent rift between the institutions of kingship and the bards, kept me well entertained. The players, meanwhile, were entertained by setting immersion (in the form of my doing storytelling) and princess play stuff, as their heroic high fantasy characters scrabbled to do a murder investigation while making genre jokes about Hercule Poirot.<br/><br/>If you were to characterize your campaign in those kinds of terms, would you say that you had Sim heat at all? Did the player characters have interesting Eberron-specific identity that would inform the way they receive the setting and adventure lore? In our campaign much of the entertainment comes from the fact that all of the PCs tend to be from these different setting-specific subcultures, which means that anything that they encounter on adventures will be explored and explained from different in-character viewpoints. That's the sort of thing I expect from a Sim D&amp;D campaign.<br/><br/>Fundamentally: if the GM isn't being entertained by getting to be the head storyteller who talks about fictional stuff that they like for hours on end each session, then there might be a creative disjunction in there, and it's not a wonder that the game feels boring. You might need to delve deeper into why you find Eberron interesting, and what precisely the game's campaign content would need to be so that you could get to share that excitement with the players directly and consistently.<br/><br/>(For me in our Prydain campaign the excitement comes from getting to repurpose the material of the <i>Chronicles of Prydain</i>, moment to moment, into a rpg adventure. It's always fun to introduce a new NPC, for example, because I get to concern myself with interpreting what they're like in the original novels, and what I get from that, and how I should portray that in play. The different plot points always bring up setting lore questions, too, which means I get to talk a lot about mythical Celtic worldview and stuff like that. The campaign involves all sorts of pet thought exercises of mine that get aired, like for instance we just spent major time last session debating the relative theological merits of Christianity and Pridonite death worship from the in-character  viewpoint of Pridonite bards.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_477348">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477348/#Comment_477348" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-10-30T07:14:17+00:00" title="October 30, 2018  7:14AM">October 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 30, 2018 7:15AM by Hans_c-o.">edited October 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, no, I don't think that, in the way you formulate it, there was any "Sim heat".\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>Fundamentally: if the GM isn't being entertained by getting to be the head storyteller who talks about fictional stuff that they like for hours on end each session, then there might be a creative disjunction in there, and it's not a wonder that the game feels boring.

Like <i>wow</i>. I can't imagine GMing a game like that, because why would the players be interested in me, essentially, geeking out about setting? I'm not saying that doesn't sound like fun -- it sounds like <i>loads</i> of fun, if everyone's on board (when I imagine DMing the D&amp;D settings I love, I imagine us all geeking out together about the settings and the cool bits of it and me transmitting that love to the players and getting them excited as well), but I shudder when I consider it, because it seems like all the worst stereotypes I've heard about D&amp;D in my lifetime. Like, you can do this and it's <i>okay</i>? How do you even get on the same page about this kind of play? I don't think I have the necessary confidence/charisma to head this kind of play.<br/><br/>You have totally shunted my thought process off into an unexpected direction.

That's what <a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen%27s">@Eero_Tuovinen's</a> description sounds like to me.  Interesting example, but not something I would want to play in or run.  Not because it doesn't sound interesting, but because of the pressure on the GM (rather than the game) to hold the players' attention.<br/><br/>2) Character/ narrative sandbox on the political/setting level.  That's my read on the carrots <a href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">@Hans_c-o</a> is describing.  Making this style of play feel both consequential and plausible in the fiction is really hard.  I like Burning Wheel for it and maybe more-so All Men Must Die (though AMMD favors the consequential over the plausible).  I can't imagine making it work in any version of D&amp;D without the GM having full control of the stakes and pacing and having the players respond to loaded prompts.<br/><br/>3) Tactical sandbox-limited-to-dungeon.  I think <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> expressed some of the limitations of this, especially around lethality.  And several people have mentioned how structured rests can keep the pressure on (and allow high enough stakes for memorable emergent narrative).<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> is where I'm spending most of my gaming time right now, primarily in a long-term Torchbearer campaign.  I think <a href="http://onesevendesign.com/breakers_wodu_turbo.pdf" rel="nofollow">John Harper's Breakers</a> has a great mechanic for keeping pressure on in this kind of game (where caution is usually the optimal strategy): a dungeon timer.  The Torchbearer adventure I'm drafting right now has a hard timer.  The dungeon is under sea level and full of ancient pumps keeping the chambers dry.  Every time the party camps, removes a pump (they are very valuable), or a pump breaks as a consequence of a twist: the water level goes up.  The lower chambers quickly become hard to navigate, and eventually the dungeon floods completely.  I think a timer like this (broadcasted to players early, but with some uncertainty) could make the tactical choices feel like part of an overall strategic operation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_477355">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477355/#Comment_477355" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-10-30T18:08:33+00:00" title="October 30, 2018  6:08PM">October 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 31, 2018 2:19PM by Airk.">edited October 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't have much to add, except that my experiences with D&amp;D5 have been very much what Paul describes -- it "sandboxes" okay (though involves rather too much prep and chargen is too involved) but does a poor job of setting players up to actually drive.

If you have the aim for a "story-oriented" game, which depends on each character's interests and goals, this can conflict with the concept of the "D&amp;D party". (There is a good reason that character-focused "story games" rarely feature the "party" conceit; it can be a challenge for a variety of reasons, not to mention that it doesn't represent most of the fiction we tend to enjoy.)<br/><br/>My friend encountered some frustration with characters who have detailed backgrounds. I've seen games where those backgrounds never came into play (also frustrating), but in this case he is an enlightened GM who is using the backstory information to build a sandbox setting which is relevant to the PCs. Unfortunately, the combination of character backgrounds, a sandbox based on those backgrounds, and the realities of the "D&amp;D party" are causing problems in the campaign, since much of it devolves to the characters arguing amongst themselves about which particular interest to pursue (presumably, with each character arguing for their own interests!).<br/><br/>The functional version of this, it seems to me, relies on the GM to decide on the order of events or interests pursued, so that a continuous story dealing with each character's background details or information can be engaged one at a time. (I see this in something like <i>Critical Role</i>, as well - the adventures occasionally draw on material from this or that character's background, but usually just one at a time. Eero's recent <i>Prydain</i> threads do some of this as well - the challenges are basically dealt with by having the GM resolve them in the structure of the campaign, not by the players themselves.) <br/><br/>In theory, you could draw background details from multiple characters into coherent adventures, but then you run the risk of a) seeming extremely contrived (e.g. the Big Bad is not only PC A's arch-nemesis in disguise, but also turns out to be PC B's father!), and, more importantly, b) creating divisions in the party and setting the characters at odds with each other.<br/><br/>Were I to do this (and I'm not planning to), I'd probably involve a very overt cyclical structure, where a given character's interests are pursued, one at a time, in turn. ("In Season One, Gorm leads the party to his childhood village, to deliver it from the Orc invasion. In Season Two, the party pursues Victorinox's arcane interests in the Tombs of Gutarnak.") That character would generally take the lead, with the other characters assisting them, allowing everyone to have their turn but for the party to remain unified and to act on interests which are aligned with each other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_477370">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/moconnor" title="moconnor"><img alt="moconnor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/483/n3W81Z19PQYI6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/moconnor">moconnor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477370/#Comment_477370" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-10-31T21:26:35+00:00" title="October 31, 2018  9:26PM">October 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>The main problem becomes handling the apparent level of challenge by negotiating how often the party rests.

I saw this and agree.  I actually worry that I'm overdoing it in my adventure, because Torchbearer has non-diagetic limitations on camping:<br/>- Each action in camp requires a check, which players earn by using their traits against themselves (making a test harder for themselves or breaking ties in their opponents favor) when they think their character traits would get in their way.<br/>- When you enter camp, the GM rolls on a random table that might disrupt the camp phase with a wandering monster or make recovery more challenging.<br/>- Recovering from conditions at camp is still an uncertain prospect, as you might fail your recovery rolls.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_477371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/moconnor" title="moconnor"><img alt="moconnor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/483/n3W81Z19PQYI6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/moconnor">moconnor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477371/#Comment_477371" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-10-31T21:53:41+00:00" title="October 31, 2018  9:53PM">October 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Were I to do this (and I'm not planning to), I'd probably involve a very overt cyclical structure, where a given character's interests are pursued, one at a time, in turn.</p></div></blockquote>\nI've tried this spotlighting with party systems and it worked really well, as long as it's a system where the GM is controlling scene-framing and pacing.  In my Masks campaign, each session (or issue) was about a particular character, dealing with their personal arc and tying it to the main plot.  However, this requires a system where the GM is the source of plot prompts to which the players respond.<br/><br/>In a sandbox game, I think this character spotlighting is out-of-place, since it requires leading prompts from the GM.  However, there are systems are conducive to functional background exploration without the GM taking the reins.<br/><br/>In Torchbearer, players can spend some of their hard-earned coin in town digging for leads to new adventures.  You can listen to rumors in the tavern (a random table that connects your friends, mentors, and enemies to an adventure location).  Then you can ask around or do research to get more intel on the site.  When the party is headed to a location, they choose a leader for that adventure.  By default its the character who found the lead in town.  During the adventure, the leader "settles disputes among the characters about direction or method of approach".<br/><br/>While this might seem similar to the GM taking turns spotlighting characters, I think the fact that it comes from the players makes a big difference.  Out of character, the players can (and do) notice that someone hasn't been adventure leader for a while, so they can hand that player some treasure and encourage them to listen to rumors and ask around about their hometown.  There's no need for leading or contrivance from the GM, except that if they roll 'mentor' on the rumors table, you have to figure out why that NPC is trapped within the nearby dungeon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_477372">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477372/#Comment_477372" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-10-31T21:56:46+00:00" title="October 31, 2018  9:56PM">October 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (I agree with that in full.

The Mercenary Company makes sense across all editions of D&amp;D, but non-old-school D&amp;D (do we have a term for this?

In no world that makes sense to me, even fantastically, does a class of people called "adventurers" exist. It strikes me as an easy way to classify Player Characters into a fictional group (and they probably chose this over the more readily apparent Mercenary Company as the default because the latter implies a certain cynicism toward morality that non-old-school D&amp;D tries to steer you away from, with weak reasoning (inasmuch as rules can be said to be a reasoned argument to the players about best practices for play)), but it makes the world less plausible, less fantastic, and it makes the PC's roles seem sort of rote. The Forgotten Realms is the most egregious example of this, with "Adventurer" practically being an occupation like any other, but many if not all of D&amp;D's official settings (all of which I love, for one reason or another) have drifted toward this over time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_477379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477379/#Comment_477379" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-01T05:41:23+00:00" title="November  1, 2018  5:41AM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 1, 2018 5:42AM by Hans_c-o.">edited November 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (double post. is there a way to delete posts? i can't see it)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_477389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/moconnor" title="moconnor"><img alt="moconnor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/483/n3W81Z19PQYI6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/moconnor">moconnor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477389/#Comment_477389" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-01T12:16:52+00:00" title="November  1, 2018 12:16PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" rel="nofollow">Hans_c-o</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>For sure. and maybe that's a piece that's missing in non-old-school D&amp;D!

I'm thinking mostly of how Crew sheets work in Blades in the Dark.  Say that when you started a new campaign, you created a company with existing debts, obligations, and connections.  Players would choose a company type: maybe a mercenary company, or a monster hunting guild, or a holy order.  Their company type would let them pursue leads for certain types of jobs in a sandbox, and when new players or characters joined, they would be the company's new recruits.  Then characters can have personality clashes or different agendas, but the understanding is that they need to stick to the company's goals.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_477390">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477390/#Comment_477390" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-01T12:43:37+00:00" title="November  1, 2018 12:43PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 1, 2018 12:45PM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited November 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" rel="nofollow">Hans_c-o</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>The Mercenary Company makes sense across all editions of D&amp;D, but non-old-school D&amp;D (do we have a term for this?

Typified by "rulings, not rules", DIY attitudes, emergent setting, pulp fantasy genre stylings, wargaming.<br/><br/><b>Middle School D&amp;D:</b> From Dragonlance through AD&amp;D 2nd edition until the fall of TSR. Typified by story arcs, GM autocracy, elaborate settings, high fantasy genre stylings. Basically "trad rpg as executed in D&amp;D"<br/><br/><b>New School D&amp;D:</b> 3rd to 5th edition D&amp;D. Typified by miniatures skirmish combat, charop, RAW, gaming fantasy genre stylings.<br/><br/>I particularly like how distinguishing between a "middle school" and "new school" helps me acknowledge that D&amp;D didn't historically just suddenly jump from old school to modern type of game - what many people think of as "old school D&amp;D" from their youth in the '80s or '90s is often better understood as its own thing when compared to the truly primordial '70s style. It's not uncommon for people to sort of talk at cross-purposes when one's thinking of '70s style D&amp;D and the other's thinking of '80s style D&amp;D.<br/><br/>The problem I've observed in a binary terminology ("old school" vs. "modern D&amp;D") is that it generally requires a person to accept <i>Dragonlance</i> and the whole playstyle it implies later on as either old school or modern. Whichever way they choose, the chosen term expands so much that I find it difficult to say anything definitive about it any more; something like say <i>Birthright</i> simply doesn't have very much in common with either <i>Keep on the Borderlands</i> (old school) or <i>Book of Nine Swords</i> (new school)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_477396">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477396/#Comment_477396" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-01T18:33:17+00:00" title="November  1, 2018  6:33PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 1, 2018 6:33PM by Hans_c-o.">edited November 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for that outline, Eero.

You clear that up very nicely.<br/><br/>Also, "gaming fantasy genre stylings" is exactly it for the New School. "D&amp;D fantasy" as a codified thing, rather than D&amp;D doing other genre emulation or play in some sort of literary fantasy sandbox.

Most of my "early roleplaying" experience were solidly "Middle School D&amp;D" (and, oddly enough, took place when I was in middle school!), and I stopped playing D&amp;D when it turned into the "new school". (In particular, the implied genre of modern D&amp;D has so much video game influence that it turns me off.) These days, I'm pretty much only interested in "old-school" D&amp;D, since we have better games to do the other stuff (for my tastes).<br/><br/>For the discussion on D&amp;D parties:<br/><br/>In the fantasy genre (outside gaming), the "group of adventurers" is always united by a common quest or goal. (With occasional examples of people united by accident, like a group shipwrecked on an island or trapped in an interdimensional pocket universe, who become close friends and eventually support each other in a common quest or goal.)<br/><br/>Therefore, to replicate that in roleplaying, someone has to bring forth that quest or goal, and all the GM's prep has to relate to it, as well. In practice, I find that this means you either need one central character for everyone else to hang on to (as we see in the literature), or for the GM to take the lead. Traditionally, it seems to fall quite naturally on the GM, since she's often the one organizing the game, developing the "campaign world", and prepping for sessions. It would be interesting to do it the other way around - character first, in other words - but putting one player, in a sense, above the others is somewhat difficult socially.<br/><br/>However, I've seen this happen naturally in ongoing campaigns where people drop in and out. Whoever has been there longest naturally becomes "the quest-bearer", and new players are basically conscripted to join their "quest", since it's the only thing to do when they join the group and start playing. ("Oh, welcome to our game! We're heading out to stop the Dark Lord from opening the Gates of Hell, and for that we need to capture the Stone of Benghazi. We lost our wizard, and we could really use a new one. Can you make some kind of character like that?")<br/><br/>As discussed earlier, without strong tools to push towards an agenda of interest for the character, the players and the GM both end up being slaves to the GM's prep (since it's so weighty). If you show up to a game and the GM starts rolling out a battlemap, figurines, and so forth, for a carefully-prepped session (keep in mind that the encounter itself could occupy most of the session, sometimes all of it!), how much of a jerk would you be to say, "Nah, I don't want to fight these guys; let's go somewhere else..."? It's what you all came to do, so you do it. Over the long term, maintaining any kind of player agency becomes difficult without adding procedures to the game which dramatically change that dynamic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_477398">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Trent_W" title="Trent_W"><img alt="Trent_W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Trent_W">Trent_W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477398/#Comment_477398" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-01T19:29:20+00:00" title="November  1, 2018  7:29PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fascinating discussion, guys, I am really enjoying the different perspectives here.<br/><br/>From my own observations, speaking as someone who did not grow up playing D&amp;D and has primarily played non-D&amp;D RPGs during his gaming history, I don't see any iteration of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, whether "old school", "new school" or anywhere in between as emulating anything other than Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

Old-school D&amp;D tended to either represent itself (phantasmagoric dungeon weirdness!) or some Sword &amp; Sorcery tropes. All that stuff from the spells named after obscure wizards ("Melf's Magic Meteor!") to the bizarre "monsters" (like Slimes, Oozes, and Jellies, Mimics, and so forth).<br/><br/>By the "middle school", however, there were a lot of rules, classes, and supplements that were very interested in recreating particular types of media - the Al-Qadim setting, or the Oriental Adventures (is that what they were called? It doesn't sound so good in 2018...), aimed at historical accuracy, referenced real-world traditions and weapons, and so forth. The 2nd Edition Combat &amp; Tactics book actually had a very thorough history of how weapons and armour developed throughout the last 2 or 3 thousands years (enough that, as a student in grade school, I cited it in a history paper about the history of warfare!). There were weapons, classes, and spells which sought to create "authentic" samurai or ninjas or Teutonic knights. (I remember those "Complete Handbooks" would have various sub-classes to represent knights/paladins from different cultures and eras of history, for instance!)<br/><br/>There was a period towards the end of 2nd Edition and the beginning of 3rd Edition where there were classes which represented merchants, sages, or other "non-adventuring" professions, and that could be modeled in feats, spells, and other abilities. (I don't know if this actually existed, but I wouldn't be surprised if at some point there was a "Catholic priest" class which only allowed men of limited alignments and granted the ability to lead a Mass at a certain level, as well as a spell which turned the eucharist from a cracker into the Body of Christ, and would obviously only be cast during a Mass - i.e. it didn't have any purpose for dungeon-delving or combat.)<br/><br/>As far as I can tell, in the "new school", most of that is gone. When I join a D&amp;D5 game, I see a Tiefling Warlock and a Dragonborn Paladin who can breathe fire alongside a Halfling who has amazing tumbling abilities (only useful in combat). That doesn't seem to represent or recreate any kind of historical reality or fictional universe - it's very much its own thing. It doesn't bring me back to 14th-century Europe, nor does it have anything to do with Tolkien or Robert E. Howard.<br/><br/>However, I could be wrong; I've never pursued an actual study of these developments through D&amp;D history. It's just the impression I have, and I'd be glad to be corrected by someone more knowledgeable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_477407">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477407/#Comment_477407" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-01T21:54:16+00:00" title="November  1, 2018  9:54PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 1, 2018 9:58PM by Hans_c-o.">edited November 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Trent_W" rel="nofollow">Trent_W</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>They're pretty much all awful at capturing the genre tropes of fantasy adventure writ large with the possible exception of 4E (probably a substantial reason why many gamers considered it Not D&amp;D in play)</p></div></blockquote>\nOh!

I couldn't agree more; that sounds like a really exciting and memorable campaign frame to play in.<br/><br/>(However, having said that, all of my D&amp;D experience in this style has always resulted in the same kind of disconnect: the GM is excited about their thematic and diegetic material, whereas the players are focused on gaining feats and playing through combats. Both end up frustrated - the GM, because the players aren't really engaging with her material, and the players because, usually, the game is too slow or they start to realize their lack of agency. I guess that's what this thread is about: whether this is just the nature of play in such games, or some kind of technical point that can be addressed with intelligent procedures and/or attitudes.)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_477442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477442/#Comment_477442" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-02T19:07:04+00:00" title="November  2, 2018  7:07PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you don't want players to focus on combat as the <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> thing, stop giving XP for combat. &lt;=)<br/><br/>The DMG offers other another option, namely Milestone Advancement, but I'm playing with replacing advancement in my Towerlands game with a checkbox system where they have to hit their four BIFT personality traits, a mentor scene, and one "impress a spirit" scene per current level -- because that's what's important to this campaign.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_477444">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Trent_W" title="Trent_W"><img alt="Trent_W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Trent_W">Trent_W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477444/#Comment_477444" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-02T19:41:53+00:00" title="November  2, 2018  7:41PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" rel="nofollow">Hans_c-o</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Oh!

Almost all gaming fantasy tropes come from Dungeons and Dragons anyway. To me, D&amp;D has always just tried to be D&amp;D (with the notable exception of 4E) and its attempts to fit other fictional stylings (such as Ravenloft or Oriental Adventure) have always been awkward and hackneyed at best.<br/><br/>I'd also dispute the entire notion of "New School" D&amp;D as being an actual thing, anyway. Eero's description of it pretty much only fits 3E. Both 4E and 5E dramatically shift away from about half the things on that list in different ways. Unless by New School D&amp;D one basically just means Pathfinder.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" rel="nofollow">Hans_c-o</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>D&amp;D play has, by and large, mostly generated the same kinds of stories.

He wasn't one of its lead designers, the stuff he actually designed for it was almost completely mediocre, and comments he's made about it up to the build-up for 5E (like the idea that 4E Warlords don't make sense because they "shout back" dismembered arms) strongly evince he didn't remotely grok 4E's design ethos or aesthetic. He is the guy that brought us Keep on the Shadowfell, after all.<br/><br/>4E is perhaps the singularly most terrible version of D&amp;D to do dungeon crawls and there was clearly a strong commitment during its inception to focus toward story-oriented cinematic fantasy adventure (and not self-referential "D&amp;D genre fantasy" either). This seemed to start to falter right around the time the PHB3 came out and there was a shift in direction (which would eventually culminate in 5E's design).<br/><br/>~ Trent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_477445">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Trent_W" title="Trent_W"><img alt="Trent_W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Trent_W">Trent_W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477445/#Comment_477445" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-02T19:59:54+00:00" title="November  2, 2018  7:59PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 2, 2018 8:00PM by Trent_W.">edited November 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" rel="nofollow">Adam_Dray</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>If you don't want players to focus on combat as the <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> thing, stop giving XP for combat. &lt;=)<br/><br/>The DMG offers other another option, namely Milestone Advancement, but I'm playing with replacing advancement in my Towerlands game with a checkbox system where they have to hit their four BIFT personality traits, a mentor scene, and one "impress a spirit" scene per current level -- because that's what's important to this campaign.&lt;/p&gt;</p></div></blockquote>\nIn my 4E home game, almost all of the XP gain has come from Skill Challenges and player-authored Quests (all of which are tied either to the campaign's Situation or to other player characters and/or NPCs). I've tried milestone leveling in the past but I disliked how it felt like "you get a level when the DM wants you to" instead of specifically reinforcing the game's reward cycles and thematic content.<br/><br/>I think part of the problem in standard D&amp;D play is that violence is rather consequence-free (and yet you're rewarded for engaging in it) and so players are more likely to have a casual attitude toward it. The stereotypical example is the "four orcs in a room" --- you get xp and/or treasure for killing them and there are rarely any social consequences for doing so, so why not kill them? It creates a rather cavalier outlook toward violence in my experience. Old-school games circumvent this problem somewhat by giving little to no XP for killing monsters and the fact that combat is intrinsically more dangerous to the PCs, but this then creates attendant issues with a DM more interested in character-driven story content.<br/><br/>~ Trent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_477446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477446/#Comment_477446" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-02T20:02:35+00:00" title="November  2, 2018  8:02PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yep.

Basically, addressing theme and premise from-the-side in a game that doesn't really support it very well.<br/><br/>The best way to get at that in D&amp;D is to force them to decide what is worth fighting for, since the game is so combat-oriented, but even that falls down a lot, because they want to fight to earn XP to level up. <br/><br/>Take away XP for killing and replace it with milestone advancement, and they will STILL want to fight and level up, because 5e makes fighting super fun. They have new gadgets to play with and they want to try them out. <br/><br/>A lot of Vanilla Narr games get along by dividing play into "the times when we fight" and "the times when we don't fight" with a huge line between them.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_477451">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477451/#Comment_477451" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-02T21:06:42+00:00" title="November  2, 2018  9:06PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Adam,<br/><br/>Doesn't it sounds like *unsuccessful* vanilla Narr play, though?

The designers seem to assume the DM will fill in the gaps themselves (what has in other places been criticized as "lazy design"), probably with techniques and procedures they've acquired from other games.<br/><br/>As an example, the advice about using Inspiration is rather anemic and seems to assume someone interested in this sort of thing has a lot of experience with FATE or other games that use player-descriptor bennies. <br/><br/>In my opinion, 5E as a whole is pretty much designed like this.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" rel="nofollow">Hans_c-o</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Trent, I've never thought of Mearls as anything but the core creator of 4e's approach to D&amp;D.

The former is more representative of people like Heinsoo, Baker, and Collins whereas the latter is more representative of people like Mearls and the current 5E team.<br/><br/>Once Mearls took over, 4E almost immediately took a huge nosedive and produced some of its most mediocre player-facing content. There was simply nobody around in the company (with the possible exception of Chris Perkins) that really grokked what 4E was trying to do. \n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" rel="nofollow">Hans_c-o</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>And I still think Eero's "New School" category make sense. 5e has dialed back on the miniatures gaming and charop aspects of this (I'd argue mostly for marketing purposes - and to great success), but they are still in there.</p></div></blockquote>\nWell, a lot of the more charop stuff in 5E is wholly optional and contingent on the DM's say-so ---- feats, magic items, and multiclassing --- but I agree a lot of it is just marketing. To me, 5E has always felt like 3E Lite more than anything else.<br/><br/>4E has charop stuff in it, but also a ton of stuff that invalidated charop too (Inherent Bonuses in the DMG2 and the constant slew of errata to hammer options that proved too strong) and it certainly saw a dramatic shift away from the self-referential D&amp;D Fantasy Genre that the game usually clings to. As an example, 4E makes it trivially easy to run a political intrigue style campaign or even a low-magic setting without implementing a bunch of houserules or hacking the game open, specifically because of assumptions for how prevalent magic is as well as the incredible diversity of fictional triggers for 4E's XP reward cycles.<br/><br/>~ Trent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_477477">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir" title="Thanuir"><img alt="Thanuir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir">Thanuir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477477/#Comment_477477" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-03T21:30:43+00:00" title="November  3, 2018  9:30PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            These two blog posts might also be somewhat related to subject at hand:<br/><br/><a href="http://revolution21days.blogspot.com/2009/09/dungeon-soap-operas-are-best-kind-of.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://revolution21days.blogspot.com/2009/09/dungeon-soap-operas-are-best-kind-of.html</a> is an example of how D&amp;D changed style of play from dungeon crawling to immersive character drama. I find this type of transition, where dungeon crawling is the initial default mode of play, and then later characters gain depth and connections to the setting and players learn to know the campaign world and the style of game changes. The example is quite an extreme case, but shift after an initial period is not so rare, in my experience.<br/><br/><a href="https://udan-adan.blogspot.com/2016/06/romantic-fantasy-revisited-1-what-it-is.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://udan-adan.blogspot.com/2016/06/romantic-fantasy-revisited-1-what-it-is.html</a> is about romantic fantasy in general, which might be relevant to the goals expressed in the original post. It has three follow-up posts.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>I asked about sandbox play, because sandbox with explicit dungeons into which one might delve is a fine way to establish the characters and get the players to know each other. It will create a shared history for the characters that survive. It will create some ties to non-player characters (rescued, helped, quest-givers, villains that survive).<br/><br/>This will start the process towards play that can easily hit these goals:\n<blockquote><br/>I wanted to run a game that forced the players to make interesting and difficult decisions, about three different things: 1) resources, 2) tactics, 3) the situation at hand, i.e., what NPCs are doing and asking of the characters and what pressure monsters and their violence are putting on the characters.<br/></blockquote>\nAny other fairly structured activity, like railroading, might also work.

Sure, you may prevent them from deliberately hunting down stuff to kill, but in my experience, most of the time that doesn't happen anyway, partly due to a lack of player ability to create those situations and partly due to a player feeling that they "shouldn't" do that, for RP reasons or the like. <br/><br/>Modern D&amp;D very much encourages the characters to roll up their sleeves and get in there and fight stuff, and it will take more than removing one of the carrots to seriously influence that.   I think without changing the rules sufficiently to provide a mechanical disincentive (i.e. "Combat is deadly") that you're unlikely to see serious changes in behavior.

Unless we go back to <b>Chainmail</b>, where the expectation is that you will control more than one character and thus be able to escape with some resources intact. Pressure to kill things and take their stuff is so much a grand touchstone of D&amp;D that it has literally become a running joke in every single media reference, including geek-insider media references, exactly since ever.<br/><br/>You don't get a reputation for murder hobos that everybody who has ever played the game gets a good laugh at unless there are murder hobos.<br/><br/>The change of XP away from XP and into milestones is something one could reasonably state makes fifth edition D&amp;D less D&amp;D. I would state that, and I don't even have a dog in this hunt.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Then again, it seems to be pretty common that people try to make 5th edition do stuff where another version of the game might serve better.

Many of them address exactly the issues that people say they have with D&amp;D, function more concretely and better, deliver a more consistent experience in line with exactly what people are describing that they want, and are easily available on this giant porn hose that we call "the Internet."<br/><br/>Especially for people who are members of this community, it would seem that there's no excuse for not knowing other, better-for-this-purpose games exist, or for recognizing that what they're demanding from D&amp;D is not something it's not designed to provide.<br/><br/>Just seems like it would be far more productive to actually figure out what you want from the game and not from D&amp;D and then go seek a game that provides those elements rather than taking D&amp;D, hollowing out its body, and then wearing the bloody skin while effectively playing something else.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_477522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir" title="Thanuir"><img alt="Thanuir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir">Thanuir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477522/#Comment_477522" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-05T18:13:34+00:00" title="November  5, 2018  6:13PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/SquidLord" rel="nofollow">SquidLord</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>Myself, I'm starting to wonder when something stops being D&amp;D and starts being "a processed D&amp;D-like product."<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nThe rules that are actually used play a role in determining what the game is like, and are important for that. The name of the ruleset is a marketing tool.<br/><br/>Whether something qualifies or not as "D&amp;D", like all questions of definitions, is only relevant when you fix a purpose for the definition. For the purpose of marketing, I seem to be well within the bounds of what most people consider D&amp;D. And that is what the name is for, for me, at the moment.\n<blockquote><br/>Once you cut out experience, and once you cut out the idea of the balanced encounter, and as others have suggested cutting out any kind of pressure toward combat \u2013 at which point does all of the mechanics of the game and the design of the set up start not being the name you're slapping on it?<br/></blockquote>\nI do not cut out experience, but I do not give it for killing things, by default. The default is experience from wealth acquired by adventuring, but the players are free to negotiate other goals and will get experience from succeeding at those, too.<br/><br/>Changing how experience is earned is very common in D&amp;D and the methods have varied quite a bit among editions. D&amp;D 5 offers milestone levelling as a method that does cut out experience, for example, and experience for good roleplay is rules as written from rules cyclopedia, as is experience from goals and killing and getting rich and heroic actions and GM fiat.<br/><br/>Balanced encounters have never been the norm, or at least almost never. Maybe with 4th edition? With third, you were explicitly supposed to mix in easy, normal and difficult encounters, for example. Very difficult, but avoidable, encounters have been there in all but possibly D&amp;D 3.5 and more modern editions.<br/><br/>And, 4th edition possibly aside, sandbox play has been an option in all the editions thus far.\n<blockquote><br/>It seems like it might be just far more reasonable and far less work to just start with a system that does what you want and say "we are playing in the D&amp;D fifth edition setting with system X."<br/><br/>Are people really so terrified of playing anything but D&amp;D that they are willing to turn the entire thing into an exercise in cutting off everything meaningful in order to just retain the brand?</blockquote>\nUsing D&amp;D 5 is a brand thing - as an immigrant in a country where my command of the native language is not adequate for playing, and due to not living in a capital region, finding players to play D&amp;D is much easier than finding players for homebrew games or other games, those those are hopefully feasible at conventions.<br/><br/>D&amp;D 5 is further convenient because it allows a measure of mechanical character customization, which many people enjoy, while keeping it mostly voluntary. Players can make their characters independently. The rules are light enough to not require extensive study to use and to allow giving stats to monsters and phenomena and spells on the fly.<br/><br/>Personally, I do not see the adjustments I have made more radical than those made in the opening post, where resting rules were completely decoupled from the fiction. That is something editions of D&amp;D have been very loathe to do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_477525">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477525/#Comment_477525" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-05T18:29:02+00:00" title="November  5, 2018  6:29PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/SquidLord" rel="nofollow">SquidLord</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>Especially for people who are members of this community, it would seem that there's no excuse for not knowing other, better-for-this-purpose games exist, or for recognizing that what they're demanding from D&amp;D is not something it's not designed to provide.<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nWhile I'm generally on board with your premise of "FFS people, play a different game!" I think in this particular case, we really have someone who was playing the game BECAUSE IT SAID IT WAS GOOD AT A THING.  And then discovering that it actually wasn't delivering on that.  You could blame them for "not doing their research" if you want, but I don't think that's fair, because the world is full of people who produce videos full of D&amp;D apparently doing the thing.<br/><br/>The problem is that D&amp;D is doing the thing on the backs of a great deal of effort by those people, not on its own merits, but there's very little way to tell that by looking.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_477526">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477526/#Comment_477526" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-05T18:33:02+00:00" title="November  5, 2018  6:33PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a counterpoint, whenever I've played modern D&amp;D (3rd Ed and up), I've *always* seen - XP for combat, balanced encounters (or something close to balanced), and "pressure towards combat" (even if it's self-imposed - it's just the sense that this is what we came to do!).<br/><br/>In theory?

Use the written rules when they are a reasonable approximation to the fictional reality, and when not, make a ruling. Keep track of rulings if you want to, or rely on memory. Have everyone agree that a ruling is reasonable; the published rules are a fall-back, in any case.<br/><br/>Maybe use gold for xp or similar house rule unless you want to play a game of monster hunters.<br/><br/>Socially, as a referee, emphasize that you are not out there to kill or to save the player characters. Roll things in the open and explain random encounter checks and so on. Emphasize that they might lose characters. Some players will not want to continue once the nature of the game becomes clear to them, which is good; others will thrive, and some will be okay but not terribly enthusiastic about the style of play.<br/><br/>And, as they say, fuck game balance. Use adventures for different editions and different games with different assumptions, and be open you are doing that. Do not adapt them to follow the logic and assumptions of the present game. Since you are playing fiction first, it works fine, and it keeps life interesting for everyone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_477534">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477534/#Comment_477534" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-05T19:37:46+00:00" title="November  5, 2018  7:37PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 5, 2018 7:44PM by Hans_c-o.">edited November 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Airk" rel="nofollow">Airk</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>While I'm generally on board with your premise of "FFS people, play a different game!"

I enjoyed myself, but was perplexed that the game didn't seem to produce the sort of gripping fiction and engagement with the kewl setting details I wanted. This was in...2006? 2007?<br/><br/>I quickly found independently-published rpgs. Dogs blew my mind in a way that accorded with what I knew of avant-garde art and fiction. <i>Of course</i> roleplaying games could do all sorts of weird and beautiful stuff, because all of the other art that I love does. I was an art major in college, and studied literature a fair bit as well, and it quickly became obvious that this rpg thing was simply in dialogue with all that. I dropped D&amp;D.<br/><br/>5e came out and I hadn't paid attention to new rpg design in a little while, because Personal Reasons, and something about the old promise lured me back (this is where I might legitimately be criticized for lazy thinking and falling for slick marketing). I liked what I saw of 4e's focused design in it. It read smooth; it seemed to Just Work (other than the rest rules that I houseruled as discussed). It seemed to give me what I wanted out of Eberronian fantasy; I was coming full circle to my first experience with rpgs and maybe trying to redeem it (though I hadn't remembered that first 3.5 Eberron session until just now, writing it out).<br/><br/>As I've said,\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" rel="nofollow">Hans_c-o</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I wanted to run a game that forced the players to make interesting and difficult decisions, about three different things: 1) resources, 2) tactics, 3) the situation at hand, i.e., what NPCs are doing and asking of the characters and what pressure monsters and their violence are putting on the characters.</p></div></blockquote>\nAnd I should add a 4) that allows me to use published D&amp;D settings easily, because I have a great deal of fondness for many published D&amp;D settings, and they seem fun to game in.<br/><br/>Now okay, <a href="/forums/profile/SquidLord">@SquidLord</a>, assume I haven't done my research: What game does that well? <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_477535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477535/#Comment_477535" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-05T19:42:19+00:00" title="November  5, 2018  7:42PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And also: one can read pages and pages and PAGES and pages about what New School D&amp;D does well and what it doesn't, but sometimes one simply has to have the experience to really <i>understand</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_477536">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477536/#Comment_477536" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-05T19:42:40+00:00" title="November  5, 2018  7:42PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Balanced encounters were not a thing in the original game, a la Gary and his players. Characters were expect to run away if they encountered something they couldn't handle. Really, once they encountered something bad, they had already messed up, since they should have been more careful, picked up on the clues, done more reconnaissance, etc.<br/><br/>Still, you could run away. The original use for vials of oil, other than the main use as lantern fuel, was to light and drop behind you to create a barrier when you were fleeing monsters. Also, you could drop food for unintelligent monsters, and I think there was a standard roll to see if they'd stop for it.<br/><br/>Actual play reports from the 70's often include encounters with creatures far too tough to kill. Either their reconnaissance warned them of the creatures (and often they'd rob the creature's treasures with <i>invisibility</i> or other sneaky measures) or they fled and (usually) narrowly escaped with their lives.<br/><br/>Remember the crazy "Mad Monk" encounter in Keep on the Borderlands (B2)? Or any number of caves you'd go in, and there'd be like 30 orcs. When I run modern players through B2, they have to learn the hard way that there's no encounter balance there. It's usually a near-TPK until they figure out how to approach things more carefully, and with better tactics than a straight-on fight.<br/><br/>Ideas of balanced encounters came in later editions, with guidelines for monster encounters codified in the 3rd edition.<br/><br/>Balance is overrated.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_477538">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SquidLord" title="SquidLord"><img alt="SquidLord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/690/n6I44LRPBAB7W.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SquidLord">SquidLord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477538/#Comment_477538" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-05T20:20:46+00:00" title="November  5, 2018  8:20PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" rel="nofollow">Hans_c-o</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>Now okay, <a href="/forums/profile/SquidLord">@SquidLord</a>, assume I haven't done my research: What game does that well? </p></div></blockquote>\nD&amp;D 4E. As written.<br/><br/>That was easy. Do you have any other questions?<br/><br/>Don't make the assumption that I haven't been in the RPG industry since before there was a story games sub-sub-sub genre. I predate filthy dirty hippie games.<br/><br/>If what you want is literally what you said, then what you want is D&amp;D 4E and all the faffing about is faffing for the sake of faffing. I'm not saying that's not something worth doing, but I am saying it's not something worth doing in public \u2013 like a lot of other activities.<br/><br/>But seriously look at this thread. Now, stop. Look at it.<br/><br/>Three quarters of the posts are about trying to make D&amp;D do things it's explicitly uninterested in doing and which any sane and sensible person would know it's uninterested in doing simply by reading the bloody thing. Reading comprehension seems to have been on the outs for the last couple of decades, but this is an extreme example.<br/><br/>At a certain point, when do we start to say that what people want is not what they say they want? If to enjoy the game you have to remove several of its axiomatic cores, are you actually enjoying that game or are you enjoying a game that has the wrong label slapped on the outside?<br/><br/>Though if you were asking me more abstractly for the name of a game that involves managing resources, tactics, and the situation at hand \u2013 I would be forced to point out that describes 99% of the RPGs out in the wild. Anything. Nearly everything. That's the whole point.<br/><br/>And if you amplified that by saying "okay, and I want to run in established D&amp;D settings," I would have to reply "you can do that in any game you invest a minimum amount of imagination in playing."<br/><br/>Personally, I would probably use some lightly hacked version of <a href="http://www.twohourwargames.com/swordsorcery.html" rel="nofollow"><b>Warrior Heroes</b></a> to run a very classic D&amp;D-inspired game and twiddling in any of the establish D&amp;D settings wouldn't be much of an effort. It's just not.<br/><br/>Hell, you could bust out the truly old-school story game <a href="http://ramsheadpublishing.com/universalis-articles/about/about-universalis/" rel="nofollow"><b>Universalis</b></a>, sit down and start banging out content cards at the table with the rest of your group and end up playing a game that is explicitly about resources, tactics, and the situation at hand \u2013 even though it completely side-steps any traditional notion of tactics in the sense of miniature wargaming tactics and the resources will be different but equally important. And the results will be in line with published D&amp;D settings if you and the other people at the table want them to be.<br/><br/>And all of that, any of that, would be a thousand times more interesting to read about than one more Fantasy Heartbreaker hack of D&amp;D. Any of that would be a thousand times more creative for everyone at the table than one more Fantasy Heartbreaker hack of D&amp;D.<br/><br/>The gain you seem to want to play is D&amp;D 4E. If I were at all interested in playing one of the offspring of D&amp;D, that would be the one that I would choose too, even though it seems to be the edition which inspired the most hate and disdain. (In fact, that might be part of why it's the most interesting edition from my point of view.)<br/><br/>So go play that one.<br/><br/>You know 5E doesn't do what you want to do. You probably should have known simply by reading it and by skimming over any of the public comments made by the designers at any point.<br/><br/>Put the mallet down, stop trying to push the rectangular prism into the circular opening, and go play a game that works for you.<br/><br/>And if it doesn't work for you, find a different game that does.<br/><br/>It just seems that most of this thread takes lonely gameplay to the next step, where people are just talking about changing a game that they're not really playing into another game that they won't really be playing.<br/><br/>If you want to play D&amp;D, go play D&amp;D. If you want to play D&amp;D 4E, go play D&amp;D 4E. But don't spend hundreds of words and millions of murdered electrons on trying to make D&amp;D do things it just won't.<br/><br/>Go find a game that will do those things and then make it do additional things to bring in the elements that you still end up wanting, if there are any.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_477539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir" title="Thanuir"><img alt="Thanuir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir">Thanuir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477539/#Comment_477539" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-05T20:30:36+00:00" title="November  5, 2018  8:30PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Squidlord, you claim to have a very strong grasp of what things D&amp;D will not do.

If you have different creative purposes for your game, however, balance can serve as a valuable tool and may even be instrumental in fulfilling those purposes.<br/><br/>I'd also argue that, although 3E and 5E both have "balanced encounter" rules, they're basically pointless exercises as the way both PCs and monsters are constructed in those games ensures there will never be such a thing as a "balanced encounter" in one's game unless the GM has a very heavy hand in a) what monsters he/she uses and b) what character options he/she allows in the game. The only edition of D&amp;D that has actually functional "balanced encounter" rules is 4E (or maybe 13th Age if you count that as "D&amp;D"), at least prior to the Epic Tier --- and the purpose of those 4E encounters isn't to "challenge" the players in any meaningful strategic sense but to provide a scene for PC characterization and protagonism, while also engaging them tactically.<br/><br/>In regards to what is or is not "D&amp;D", my take on the issue is that each instance of D&amp;D-esque publishing is its own self-contained entity and there is little creative continuity in the license except in the most vague and abstract sense possible --- with the caveat that 5E seems to be trying really hard to be 2E using 3E's ruleset (with predictably mixed results).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_477541">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477541/#Comment_477541" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-05T20:58:41+00:00" title="November  5, 2018  8:58PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 5, 2018 8:58PM by Hans_c-o.">edited November 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/SquidLord" rel="nofollow">SquidLord</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>Don't make the assumption that I haven't been in the RPG industry since before there was a story games sub-sub-sub genre.

Yes, there wasn't any idea of a "balanced" encounter. But there totally WERE lots of ideas about what was "appropriate" on level 1 of a dungeon, and that was less dangerous than what was appropriate on level 2, and that was less dangerous than level 3, etc.  Because even Gary knew that if you put 3d6 ogres in room 1 of the first level of your dungeon, you were going to kill the whole level 1 party and have a sucky game.  Level 1 was supposed to "mostly" be populated with weaker monsters.  Yeah, there might be a room at the back that HAS 3d6 ogres in it, and maybe they're the bosses of all the other monsters in the dungeon and sometimes you find one or two of them stomping around collecting tribute on the wandering monster table, but the whole thing was BUILT around the assumption that yeah, 2d6 ogres could not usefully be the "standard" encounter on level 1 of the dungeon.  This was reflected all over the place, in random "stocking" tables and the like.<br/><br/>Yes, the PCs were expected to somehow deal with or die to the occasional "off level" encounter, but the idea of "These are the typical kinds of monsters you encounter on level 1 of the dungeon" is baked right in there and it feels inaccurate to assert that the concept of a "balanced encounter" didn't exist, because it pretty much did, albeit in a less precise way (A room containing 5d10 orcs could well be fine even though 50 orcs would obviously kill the party if they fought them.)<br/><br/>What wasn't present was the idea that ALL encounters needed to be balanced and that the DM was "doing something wrong" by presenting an encounter that WASN'T balanced.  But I think any party of old school gamers who went into a dungeon at level 1 and found it largely populated by basilisks, ogres, hydras, neo-otyughs and Xorns is probably going to be pretty cranky at the DM who told them (directly or indirectly, if you want to include the whole "Did you pick the right dungeon?" nonsense) that this was the right dungeon for their first adventure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_477543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Trent_W" title="Trent_W"><img alt="Trent_W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Trent_W">Trent_W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477543/#Comment_477543" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-05T21:10:06+00:00" title="November  5, 2018  9:10PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">@Hans_c-o</a> Oh, I totally agree.

There is also the little known practice of budgeting an encounter that would be extremely hard (if not impossible) in a straight-up fight but also having other means of overcoming it, whether that's an aspect of the terrain or some sort of skill challenge. The first adventure in the Scales of War AP, for example, features an Ogre for a party of 1st level PCs (which would decimate them in a toe-to-toe fight) but the Ogre is constrained in a way that it can still be defeated.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_477549">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477549/#Comment_477549" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-05T22:51:34+00:00" title="November  5, 2018 10:51PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If it isn't too far afield, I might suggest at least experimenting with some campaign minis wargame at a warband level.

I agree with your take on modern D&amp;D's emphasis on fantasy action-adventure. Although, I fail to see how 5E's take on skills is reasonably different than either 3E or 4E. Its basically just a slight rephrase of the Bluff and Diplomacy skills from those editions (both of which were keyed off Charisma, as well). The only difference is 5E's skills are more vague and less defined than the skills in 3E and 4E, so instead of the players knowing up front what they can likely do with the skill it is left up to the DM to make something up on the fly.<br/><br/>I would also dispute the notion that 4E doesn't have a mechanic for persuading others. High-stakes persuasion scenes are clearly the domain of 4E's Skill Challenge system and an example of such is even given in the DMG. I mean, its true 4E doesn't have a mechanic for persuading people <i>in a single roll or action</i>* but that's because of its philosophical approach that all meaningful conflicts in the game should involve all the players (as opposed to a spotlight rotation philosophy).<br/><br/>*(Ignoring the rule that you can use the Intimidate skill to force bloodied enemies to surrender, which is definitely a form of "persuasion").*<br/><br/>Also, for all the claims that 5E is a more flexible or generic framework, 4E's Skill Challenge framework coupled with its use of Quests to leverage player-authored goals/keys/themes provides a much stronger support for the types of play you are describing here than anything in 5E to date. And, that's before even getting into the chapter in the DMG2 that discusses collaborative storytelling, roleplaying vignettes, and integrating these sorts of structures into 4E's mechanical reward cycles.<br/><br/>I would point out, of course, that a lot of 4E DM's didn't try to use Skill Challenges (or, if they did, just didn't grok them) so the general perception 4E couldn't approach these types of play is understandable if misinformed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_477558">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir" title="Thanuir"><img alt="Thanuir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir">Thanuir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477558/#Comment_477558" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-06T08:04:35+00:00" title="November  6, 2018  8:04AM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" rel="nofollow">JDCorley</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>5e jumbles this approach.

Ignoring the utterly broken 3rd edition diplomacy, which is so strong as that it turns social challenges into challenges about managing friends and allies if played hard, the rules are typically vague and sketchy because most roleplayers are completely happy and capable of playing social challenges without elaborate mechanical support.<br/><br/>In fact, having only vague skills allows for a multitude of approaches, with anything ranging from mostly ignoring the skills or using them as inspiration and characterization, not for rolls, to using them essentially as reaction rolls and checking for the attention of the target is changing, to using explicit stakes setting in the style of for example Burning wheel, to just rolling dice and not roleplaying at all. Same can be done with charisma rolls and/or reaction rolls in the editions that do not have explicit skill rules.<br/><br/>Likewise, many roleplayers are completely happy playing character drama, or slice-of-life, with little mechanical support. Hence, they are also always on the table with D&amp;D, much like with every other traditional roleplaying game (here meaning: players play characters, GM the world, rules discuss how skilled characters are and how successful they are at tasks).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_477578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477578/#Comment_477578" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-06T18:32:48+00:00" title="November  6, 2018  6:32PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 6, 2018 6:33PM by JDCorley.">edited November 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's the whole point of what I posted - that once you get away from overcoming challenges, that modern D&amp;D really starts to stumble and eventually you end up in freeform land and you're trying to push back on something and the mechanical gears aren't there to make that pressure work.

At some point we're going to need to adjust course - to turn the steering wheel, even just a little bit.

I can parse them from rules texts or actual play culture, same as any other game. It is wrong to call D&amp;D only a culture or ideology, as clearly not everybody treats it that way - I personally know many people who are fully competent to treat D&amp;D as a specific game (or several), with specific conceits that they are capable of setting aside when they play other games. (I do know people who are incapable of that as well, admittedly - true members of the D&amp;D culture, one might say.)<br/><br/>That being said, however, not only has the D&amp;D brand been whored out over the years nilly-willy, which has caused several different games to emerge under that name, but the way TSR utilized the brand also made it become something that I would basically consider a generic trademark. "D&amp;D" in common parlance encompasses a meaning so wide it's essentially the same as "fantasy adventure roleplaying game". (This was not accidental under the later management of TSR, I understand; I hear they wanted to maintain D&amp;D's market dominance, and chose to attempt it by making AD&amp;D's second edition into the one true game that was supposed to have everything for everybody.)<br/><br/>If you feel like doubting that claim about D&amp;D being sorta generic as a label, try a thought experiment: if you stumbled upon a group playing a relatively normal fantasy adventure rpg - <i>Earthdawn</i> or <i>Runequest</i> or whatever - that was not D&amp;D, would you truly have any reason to claim that it is not D&amp;D except for the incidence of the name? What if the group informed you that they're playing D&amp;D, just with some house rules? Why are they wrong, aside from the brand technicality? What is the essence of D&amp;D that their campaign lacks but D&amp;D in all its mutated iterations has? I would argue that the existence of such essence is a rather technical matter, only of interest to scholars of roleplaying, and that the average consumer might as well call all fantasy adventure roleplaying games "D&amp;D" for all the difference that makes to the experience of play.<br/><br/>I guess it depends on what you mean by D&amp;D: if we're talking about the phenomenon in general, I would argue that it is a genre of gaming - ideology is a good description, really. If we're looking at specific game texts, however, or specific schools of play (of which D&amp;D historically has developed several, as has been discussed), then it is very possible to observe a well-defined game. You'll never capture everything that's ever happened under the brand name into a single well-designed and concrete game, but if you're happy with <b>a</b> game that is D&amp;D, that is possible. (I recommend the Mentzer Red Box myself - it's indisputably "D&amp;D", but it's also more well-defined as a game than most traditional rpgs, consisting of much more real procedure than your typical fluff-and-powers rpg.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_477588">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477588/#Comment_477588" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-06T22:12:21+00:00" title="November  6, 2018 10:12PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 6, 2018 10:12PM by Paul_T.">edited November 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, "middle school" D&amp;D is decidedly broader in scope (or, at least claims to be) than the earlier and modern varieties.<br/><br/>Let me just say that I love the label "fluff-and-powers RPG"!

See for example the blog post I linked earlier. It is for OSR, but the events are not rules-specific.<br/><br/>2. Is your claim that D&amp;D is not better than freeform, or that D&amp;D is actively worse than freeform, for, say, playing a game focused on relationships and slices-of-life? I would say that D&amp;D 5 offers roughly the same level of support as most traditional roleplaying games, 3rd and 4th editions offer less, old school offers very different support, and I can not really comment on AD&amp;D 2 etc. But many people also play such games with no mechanical support whatsoever and prefer that.<br/><br/>3. I do not think that a particular book has ever mattered a great deal. People have learned how to play roleplaying games by a random process involving various amounts of books, mentors, gaming groups, online material, magazines, and related media (computer games, books, movies, now streams).<br/><br/>For someone starting out the specifics on how to run a game written somewhere do not matter a great deal (I think) - it is a strange mental discipline one needs to get a hang of first, and then various finer distinctions can be made.<br/><br/>Those who grasp what roleplaying is also have preferences and experiences, and they might or might not prioritize what some book says over these, if they even read all the books, cover-to-cover, which some will do, and many will not do.<br/><br/><br/>There seems to be roughly three groups of people who actually care about the minutiae of the game books say. First is character optimisers. Second is game designers who care about their craft (at least they care about what their own book says, one hopes). Third is people who analyze games to divine their true purpose; Forge had a lot of this going on, as did the early OSR.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_477605">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477605/#Comment_477605" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-07T14:37:05+00:00" title="November  7, 2018  2:37PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I for one would certainly rather freeform Slice of Life than use D&amp;D for it.

Their presence makes certain implicit arguments and shapes expectations even when they aren't explicitly interacted with during play (something that I think might tend to be more true for games that are less procedural). In that sense, "Freeform Within D&amp;D" is still going to have constraints that will shape the fiction in a way that's different from "Non-D&amp;D-Constrained Freeform."<br/><br/>There was a conversation recently on S-G about what purpose ability scores serve, and someone made the very important observation that they can explain what the game is about, and in some cases make arguments about the game/game world (for example, you can either be smart or strong, but not both) that can potentially transcend their actual use. I think that's another good example of rules as ephemeral boundary markers rather than rules as productive procedures.<br/><br/>So maybe for some people, knowing their attack bonus <i>is</i> somehow beneficial to telling a story about relationships and slice of life. Sometimes the weird internal mechanical logic of games can take us to places that we wouldn't reach otherwise, even if those places aren't defined directly by the rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_477608">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477608/#Comment_477608" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-07T15:45:14+00:00" title="November  7, 2018  3:45PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...

You want to have dungeoneering or fantasy action or domain management or magic research or whatever you think D&amp;D is good for *and* the slices of life.<br/><br/>2. You start playing D&amp;D and the slides into personal drama and slice of life. You rescue some villagers, find out the tavern-keeper is a monster, kill them, are gifted with a tavern, and then as a group you figure out that running the tavern and interacting with the locals and guests is pretty fun, actually.

Using any traditional set of rpg rules is a fast way of coming to an agreement about such matters.<br/><br/>And of course you need to agree about the style of play etc., but this is the case most of the time when playing roleplaying games - always when using homebrew or most traditional games (that do not have a strong all-encompassing focus) and usually when using highly specialized games because you are the only one who has read it anyway and so has to explain it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_477671">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johann" title="Johann"><img alt="Johann" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johann">Johann</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477671/#Comment_477671" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-09T12:38:30+00:00" title="November  9, 2018 12:38PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" rel="nofollow">Adam_Dray</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I have been disappointed with most of the canned adventures for 5e from Wizards, with the exception of <i>Waterdeep: Dragon Heist</i>, which I've only read, but is the most brilliant adventure module ever written.</p></div></blockquote>\nI'm intrigued, so I've started a new thread <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/21856/d-d-5e-dragon-heist?new=1" rel="nofollow">here</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_477711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Corvinity" title="Corvinity"><img alt="Corvinity" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Corvinity">Corvinity</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477711/#Comment_477711" name="Item_94" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-11T17:55:31+00:00" title="November 11, 2018  5:55PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Haven't read the whole thread, but I wanted to respond to some of the comments further up regarding "simulationist" play (the players play their characters, the GM plays the world but doesn't create a story per se, see what happens), and the difficulty of making it work.<br/><br/>I think one way to make this style of play work (possibly) is for the characters to have strong motivations and well-defined goals.  Next time I want to play a game like this, I'll probably import some version of Unknown Armies 3e's Objectives mechanic into whatever game I'm using.<br/><br/>The problem with doing this in D&amp;D is that for player characters to have well-defined goals, the players need to have a certain level of knowledge about the setting.  D&amp;D has so many different settings, and also encourages the DM to create their own setting, so the likelihood that all the players are going to have a decent familiarity with the specific setting you're playing in is pretty low.<br/><br/>That being said, it could be possible to introduce the players to the major factions that will be in play in the game and what their goals are, and let the group come up with a collective goal that they're all highly invested in.  You could also allow player input on the setting up front before play starts.  <br/><br/>Then, I'd award XP for reaching specific pre-defined milestones on the way to that goal, and lots of XP for achieving the goal.<br/><br/>It wouldn't be hard to also graft on the UA3 Objective mechanic whole cloth.  I don't remember it exactly right now, but it's something like, when they do something toward the goal, they roll a d10 (or two depending on what they did) and add it to the percentile rating of their objective.  When the objective reaches 100%, they've successfully achieved it.  At any time, the whole group can agree to just go for it, roll percentile dice, and if they roll under the current rating of the objective, they've achieved it.  If not, they've failed (or it's reduced by a certain number).  You could do this style of play without a mechanic for reaching goals, but it could also help to have one.<br/><br/>D&amp;D is certainly not the best system for this, for a variety of reasons, but D&amp;D 5e is often the easiest game to get players for, so it's nice to be able to tweak it in the direction of whatever playstyle you enjoy.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_477714">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477714/#Comment_477714" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-11T20:43:16+00:00" title="November 11, 2018  8:43PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's annoying that Personality Traits / BIFTs don't include Goal.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_477723">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477723/#Comment_477723" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-12T15:03:43+00:00" title="November 12, 2018  3:03PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 12, 2018 3:04PM by WarriorMonk.">edited November 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's annoying that the whole game still points through the rules and mechanics that the objective is plainly to kill monsters for loot and XP, yet modules point that PCs should have other motivations. Except the kind of motivations that would take them away from the place because designing new places, obstacles and plot takes too much time to do it properly at the table and still achieve Flow.<br/><br/>BIFTs and Alignment are actually really great for roleplaying, but both are mainly reactive. That isn't bad per se but again, it points at a game where the GM is expected to come up with objectives and motivations that fit both the characters and the story. Or does it?<br/><br/>I mean, there's also the current of thought where we get players familiarized with the main setting parts at character creation (building the setting together with the players being the best way to do this, IMHO), sandbox the game, give fronts a plan instead of prepping events, let randon encounters happen and let a story emerge out of that by having players define their objective before prepping what kind of conflict we should throw into their path.<br/><br/>Otherwise you need collaborative players and some illusionism to fill the holes in the game mechanics if you want the kind of stories presented in the modules or something even closer to the fiction sources. Which is something the rules reccomend at some point if I'm not mistaken.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/DeReel" rel="nofollow">DeReel</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>... They are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">framed</span> by the expectation that the rules text and illustrations have created.</p></div></blockquote>\nI's more like we're being framed on our own expectations of / prejudices against the game, which come from previous editions, other games, which fictional source are we looking the game through, best and worst RPG moments in our life, our gaming group, etc. These make us read the same rules and understand them differently, and even completely miss things that are or never were in the book, yet swear over Gygax tomb that we know them to be The Game As It Should Be Played.<br/><br/>I thought Illusionism was the only way to play until SG proved me it wasn't ethic to rob players from their choices. Then SG (and my group) made me doubt if I should instead steal the Illusion from the players for the sake of fairness. I prepped a lot to be ready for a survival minigame with the first levels of 5e, but the game <i>betrayed</i> me by giving the players options to bypass the whole deal of logistics, like the Wanderer feature of the Outlander background or the Goliath features.<br/><br/>There isn't a single way to play the game, not even by RAW. It's a bunch of too many rules, systems and subsystems created by different people with different intentions, so it requires players and GMs to read a lot, experiment and make conscious choices to get different things out of it. By comparision, hacking it is easier and playing a different, less complex, straight-to-the-point game (or just one that you are more familiar with) is even easier, but different people will find their own different solutions to the same problem, and that would be for the best.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_477741">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shimrod" title="shimrod"><img alt="shimrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shimrod">shimrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477741/#Comment_477741" name="Item_97" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-13T16:33:16+00:00" title="November 13, 2018  4:33PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Adam's solution is brilliant, in my opinion: he has resting "erase" or counter some of the benefits of gaining XP, so that choosing to rest is something you always want to balance against your HP total (or other resources lost) and your desire to level up and gain abilities.

That meant a 15-minute adventuring day, more or less.<br/><br/>I used a rest system adapted from the one in <i>13th Age</i>. You gained XP normally. Also, every time you earned 1/4 of the XP needed to gain the next level without taking a long rest, you earned an "advancement." Any time you took a long rest, the XP needed to gain the next advancement was reset.<br/><br/>An advancement is defined similarly to how it is in <i>13th Age</i>. Essentially, you get one of the perks of the next level: more hit points, access to a new spell level, a new class ability, or similar. <br/><br/>Each advancement puts you incrementally closer to having the stuff at the next level. You get three advancements, then you have enough XP for the level and you just level up and get all the stuff you'd get at that level. <br/><br/>If you earn 1/4 the XP needed for the next level without a rest, congratulations! You get the advancement AND can take the long rest without penalty.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_477748">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477748/#Comment_477748" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-13T20:46:15+00:00" title="November 13, 2018  8:46PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is extremely well put.

It didn\u2019t feel like they were \u201cplaying through the DM\u2019s story,\u201d or like we were \u201cplaying to find out what happens [to the characters]\u201d, it simply felt like I was presenting scenarios, the players were responding to them in the expected way, and at the end not much interesting had taken place, because I wasn\u2019t and didn\u2019t want to create a story to present to the players, but as players of the game they didn\u2019t have player-priority tools to move the game in any particular direction beyond the bounds of what their characters\u2019 abilities offered them within the scenario. I could either present a story (which I didn\u2019t want to do), or I could leave it up to play and have emergent story. Whereas OSR-style D&amp;D allows interesting emergent play to happen because of the challenge-based nature of play (i.e., the reward system), 5e has no real space for emergent play. Consider that the base rules for XP (kill monsters), is almost entirely done away with in nearly every WotC-published 5e adventure. They love Milestone experience, which is \u201cwhenever the DM decides you level, you level.\u201d</blockquote>\nI bake something I affectionately call "loaf." Not meatloaf. Just <i>loaf</i>. It has commonalities with meatloaf, but it is more loafy and less meaty. Loaf is a casserole of pureed vegetables and meat, baked at 350 degrees for an hour. Voila! Loaf exits the oven.<br/><br/>Loaf is not delicious. It is not my first choice for food. The taste varies slightly depending on the exact ingredients, but it is always mild and palatable. It is a healthy, inexpensive dish that provides a balanced meal of carbohydrates, fat, and protein for those times when I am unable to take the time to cook during the week.<br/><br/>5e is D&amp;D loaf. It's a bland meal that is nobody's first choice. It holds the title and trappings of D&amp;D, but it doesn't do much with it. It's mostly balanced, and the combat is somewhat interesting, and the skill system is functional enough, yet it never does anything with it. 3e was a disastrous product, totally incoherent, but it made character building an integral part of the game. 4e was brilliant if you enjoy miniatures combat. OSR games are delightful for the unexpected twists that can surprise even the DM. 5e manages to snatch up little bits and pieces of every edition and mush them together until you have D&amp;D loaf.<br/><br/>There is no challenge to the players beyond the first few levels. The resources available outstrip available outstrip anything but encounter marathons. Skill tests require little thought, being mere exercises of d20 rolls with arbitrary DCs set by the GM's whim. The players can direct the game if the GM allows it, and most players are content to sit passively as events unfold before them. There is the occasional dice roll with the appropriate cheer or boo at the inevitable 20 or 1 (which is determined almost entirely by the DM's caprice, since he alone dictates how frequently the dice will hit the table).<br/><br/>The mechanics themselves are somewhat player-facing, except when they aren't, and they mostly content themselves with being about new-albeit-not-that-interesting ways to murder monsters, which is fitting as the game's only concrete mechanics for impacting are those for murder. Or justifiable homicide, since everything else outside of is a shoulder-shrug with a message of "ask your DM for permission," and the DM's tools are "roll the dice and let things happen (sometimes, but not too many times)." Unless you are playing a spellcaster, in which the world is at your wiggling fingertips. Solve mysteries! Demand fealty from gods and kings! Explore the exciting world of powercreep with every splatbook!<br/><br/>It's all so tiresome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_477826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477826/#Comment_477826" name="Item_111" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-15T23:37:52+00:00" title="November 15, 2018 11:37PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Thanuir" rel="nofollow">Thanuir</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p> </p><blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>Frankly, I don't see any reason NOT to use this in D&amp;D5, all the time.<br/><br/>Are there any?<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nMany people do not enjoy disassociated mechanics, i.e. rules that do not have an interpretation in the fiction.

I can make 5e function, but it requires proactive, engaged players and a DM who is willing to cannibalize other systems and stitch their pieces onto the chassis of 5e. Skill challenges, partial successes, Aspects, compels, and the like.<br/><br/>That being said, I will ever-so-briefly defend 5e. I detest dissociated mechanics, but I tolerate Armor Class, hit points, and the like because they are abstractions that can be explained in the fiction. Armor Class represents your armor's ability to protect you from harm by deflecting and absorbing blows, whereas hit points are all the intangibles that go into a man's fighting spirit. Experience points and levels both represent something fictionally, even if they're a bit silly. (Gold as XP makes more sense to me despite it being an entirely gamist construct.)<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/2097%27s">@2097's</a> experiences lead me to believe she has players who are more willing to set aside mechanics to engage with the fiction. My own are not, which is one of the reasons that I grow weary of 5e. It promulgates a mechanics-first mindset that is totally destructive to roleplay. One can argue this is true for all editions of D&amp;D, but the later editions have certainly worsened it considerably. As mechanics in OSR games are primarily DM-facing, it encourages gaming the GM by engaging the fiction to persuade him to rule in a certain way (in my opinion). To put it bluntly, without fun toys for the players, the players will make their own fun. (That itself is an interesting concept: does creating mechanics that produce discrete effects by engaging the fiction reduce fictional engagement or enhance it?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_477832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477832/#Comment_477832" name="Item_113" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-16T01:25:49+00:00" title="November 16, 2018  1:25AM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Rafu" rel="nofollow">Rafu</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>Those people should have a really hard time playing a game with such glaring abstractions as hit points, armor class, character classes, experience points &amp; experience levels, to name but a few.

This actually has nothing to do with dissociation as it is used in D&amp;D circles.<br/>A "dissociated" mechanic is one that doesn't map to anything in the game world.  Hit points map to "How hard is this person to kill?" Armor Class maps to "Having more defenses makes you harder to hit." and experience points and levels map to increased "experience" doing things and the increasing ability that comes with it. <br/>Dissociated things are: Action points.

That was because the moment you had an abstraction that is so abstract different people gave different fictional explanations of it (hit points!), that felt dissociated to me. I was unable to appreciate abstraction as elegance.<br/><br/>Maybe I should have mentioned "<b>spells per day</b>" as my No. 1 example... That's obviously, glaringly a dissociated mechanic that they later tried to plaster over by providing ad hoc "in world" justifications, with all the sorts of funny side-effects. The non-D&amp;D fantasy role-playing scene of the 1990s (it was a thing in my country at least) is easily summed up with "spells-per-day sucks".<br/> <br/>Later in life (D&amp;D3 was a factor in it, but perhaps not the main factor) I jumped camps completely: I saw that the true evil of spells-per-day lies not in the dissociated mechanism per se, but in clumsy attempt at providing fictional justification. I now tend to <i>favor</i> dissociated mechanics over most alternatives, as long as we're all honest and straightforward about the mechanics being dissociated: finding justification for it, when necessary, is a moment-to-moment exercise in improvisation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_477839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477839/#Comment_477839" name="Item_120" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-16T11:18:41+00:00" title="November 16, 2018 11:18AM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 16, 2018 11:22AM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited November 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It may be useful to keep in mind that the disassociation theory may be viewed as a made-to-order justification that explains why trad rpgs, including D&amp;D, are the bestest roleplaying games. With this origin in mind it may not come as a surprise if mechanics present in D&amp;D are considered very naturally fiction-associative, while mechanics foreign to that tradition are considered disassociative. I am uncertain whether it's possible to say anything more about the disassociativeness of game mechanics except that people like what they are used to, and there's a difference between gamers in whether they react positively or negatively to new things. Take a bunch of people with a similar gaming background and a conservative mindset, and you could even get the impression that there really is some sort of disassociation phenomenon behind their consistent dislike of certain types of games, when the cause might instead be simply that they all like the same old games.<br/><br/>That aside, my personal experience of what's "unrealistic" in D&amp;D as a 90s kid used to more advanced games aligns with Rafu's - all those mechanics are rather abstract and simplistic compared to what a more simulation-oriented, newer game had to offer.

There is no culture on Earth where traditional magical folklore works on spell slots. The same holds for fantasy literature, both old and young, with the sole exception of Vance, whose system D&amp;D merely approximates.<br/><br/>I will especially highlight one element of the system that young Eero found particularly weird in the '90s: does somebody really think that magicians having to memorize their magic spells by rote every morning is somehow evocative and cool? Is that what being a "wizard" means to someone - the ability to quickly and thoroughly memorize meaningless rote? And then using magic is actually a process that makes you forget magical lore, is that how it works?<br/><br/>There are, of course, other elements of the D&amp;D magic system that could be criticized on grounds of disassociativeness. The lack of mystical flair and mythic underpinnings, for instance. It's so bad that the tasteless way D&amp;D names its spells, and the humdrum utilitarian effects, actually make it seem <i>less</i> magical than if the game didn't have a magic system at all.<br/><br/>I mean, I personally accept that "making sense" is in the eye of the beholder and this whole disassociation business doesn't actually mean anything except that things make sense to people who are used to them. But D&amp;D being really popular and all American roleplayers having started with it doesn't automatically get to mean that D&amp;D somehow makes better sense than anything else.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_477852">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/moconnor" title="moconnor"><img alt="moconnor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/483/n3W81Z19PQYI6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/moconnor">moconnor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477852/#Comment_477852" name="Item_124" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-16T19:17:18+00:00" title="November 16, 2018  7:17PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p> I mean, I personally accept that "making sense" is in the eye of the beholder.</p></div></blockquote>\nba dum tss<br/>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Torchbearer Text" rel="nofollow">Torchbearer Text</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>Magic in the world of Torchbearer consists of drawing forth mystical substance from the aetherial plane and shaping it with the caster\u2019s will.

Because magic-users are the D&amp;D equivalent of ballistas and catapaults. Ipso facto, they have to run out of "ammo". Its as simple as that. One can put lipstick on a pig all one wants, but at the end of the day lets call a spade a spade, shall we?<br/><br/>The "disassociated mechanics" argument was always interesting to me because it seemed to talk about two very different phenomena: 1) any mechanic that couldn't be rationalized from Actor Stance (this is where the pejorative that "you're not roleplaying" when you use such mechanics comes from), and 2) any mechanic that didn't "make sense" in the fiction. As <a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">@Eero_Tuovinen</a> correctly pointed out, "makes sense" is a subjective issue and has more to do with familiarity more than anything else.<br/><br/>Personally, when I first read the Disassociated Mechanics essay it came across to me as a just a really fancy way of saying They Changed It, Now It Sucks: <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_477854">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Trent_W" title="Trent_W"><img alt="Trent_W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Trent_W">Trent_W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477854/#Comment_477854" name="Item_126" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-16T19:39:36+00:00" title="November 16, 2018  7:39PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Airk" rel="nofollow">Airk</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p> </p><blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/komradebob" rel="nofollow">komradebob</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p> </p><blockquote>4e was brilliant if you enjoy miniatures combat.</blockquote></div></blockquote>\nI'm gonna differ on this point. <br/><br/><br/>Strongly.</div></blockquote>\nYeah, it was brilliant either way. ;P<br/><br/>I don't know about brilliant, but 4E has definitely been the most <i>fun</i> I've ever had doing combat in a roleplaying game. <br/><br/>That being said, the most fun I've ever had in 4E was doing multi-phase dynamic skill challenges, not combat.<br/><br/>Make of that what you will.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_477877">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477877/#Comment_477877" name="Item_127" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-17T18:44:50+00:00" title="November 17, 2018  6:44PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it would be a good idea not to turn this into a thread about 4E, but (as someone who's never played the game) I'd love to hear about what makes D&amp;D4 superlative as a combat game. Trent, would you consider starting a new thread about that? I, for one, would love to hear about it! Maybe it will finally convince me to give the game a try, as well...<br/><br/>As for 5th Edition D&amp;D, I agree with the assessment that the game does an excellent job of combining features of all the editions and feeling "familiar" to a lot of people. (It fails with me largely not because of the rules, but because of the fictional aesthetics - I'm not keen on the "video game" influence and "my D&amp;D" has never included things like Tieflings and Dragonborn Sorcerers, so the new D&amp;D - at least out of the book! - doesn't work for me as a nostalgia-device, either.)<br/><br/>So, it does a good job of pleasing people who are interested in "playing D&amp;D" and want a version that's flexible enough to do a whole bunch of things that look and taste D&amp;D-like. It's flexible and well-designed.<br/><br/>However, what kind of gameplay IS it good for? What does it support well?<br/><br/>(1) I know some people have managed to do pretty well running D&amp;D5 in a "sandbox" style. For me, some of the design features are incompatible with how I think a sandbox should run (this is largely about lengthy and high-investment character creation, XP for monsters, and the 15-minute adventuring day/resting.encounter balancing game), but I can see this going well for some.<br/><br/>(2) I've heard a few people do a more story-oriented D&amp;D, and they all manage by hacking the XP rules and leaving more heavily on Inspiration (some even going so far as using Inspiration rules like Fate Compels!) by bringing in techniques and procedures from other story games, but I'm skeptical that this is something we shouldn't consider as a separate/different game. I wouldn't include this playstyle as "native" to D&amp;D5, personally, because of the extensive hacking required (even if the rules changes might seem minor, at a glance, the procedural changes to playing the game and GMing/prepping the game that they bring with them are thoroughly different from the game as written, in my opinion).<br/><br/>(3) What I seem to see more often is D&amp;D as a somewhat Participationist exercise, as described in this thread. The players come prepared to do D&amp;D adventure things, the GM preps and throws encounters in front of them, the PCs face them in more-or-less expected ways (usually this involves pursuing obvious plot hooks and then spending much of the session playing through setpiece combat encounters).<br/><br/>From what I've seen of <i>Critical Role</i>, which seems to be the template for modern D&amp;D play, this is exactly what the game is "about" and how it should be played.<br/><br/>The design of published adventures seems to be all about this, as well.<br/><br/>I don't have a beef with this playstyle, but I no longer enjoy it, either.<br/><br/>My hypothesis/assessment here is that D&amp;D5, with either a great deal of effort or a willing lowering of standards, can work for type (1), but generally seems to be better suited - and is usually used - for type (3).<br/><br/>Does anyone disagree? Am I missing other fun ways to play D&amp;D5? What other modes of play do you think that the game is well-suited for, 'out of the box'? If so, can you explain what design features or mechanics support those modes of play?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_477879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477879/#Comment_477879" name="Item_128" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-18T02:05:58+00:00" title="November 18, 2018  2:05AM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man, so much judgment.

It does what it's supposed to do, but some people prefer to play differently, and by and large the rules support it, if those people at least have a basic liking for the game. 5e as a game is meant to be hacked a bit. If you want more lethality, there are options in the rules to do that. The DMG contains toolkits for hacking it. There's a pretty deep "hack it and make it yours mentality" that comes from the top.

With this origin in mind it may not come as a surprise if mechanics present in D&amp;D are considered very naturally fiction-associative, while mechanics foreign to that tradition are considered disassociative. I am uncertain whether it's possible to say anything more about the disassociativeness of game mechanics except that people like what they are used to, and there's a difference between gamers in whether they react positively or negatively to new things. Take a bunch of people with a similar gaming background and a conservative mindset, and you could even get the impression that there really is some sort of disassociation phenomenon behind their consistent dislike of certain types of games, when the cause might instead be simply that they all like the same old games.<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nI'll try to mount a defense for the concept of "disassociated mechanic" as a useful one. Let us see how this goes.<br/><br/>1. Some rules are clearly and obviously tied to fiction; strength score and creature size being extreme examples.<br/><br/>2. Some rules, like 13th age style resting (rest once every 4 encounters; the number might be wrong), are quite disassociated from the fiction.<br/><br/>3. An associated (non-disassociated, whatever) mechanic allows the participants to guess the game mechanical interpretations of various things in the fiction, or at least not be surprised by them.<br/><br/>Given a description of a monster, different people can give it strength scores and they will probably be in the same ballpark, and they can have a discussion about how strong a monster should be (by comparing it to other monsters and considering that it can lift a carriage and so on).<br/><br/>In a similar way, in a noisy clockwork dungeon, if a game master says that it is not possible to get a long rest because the clanking makes sleep impossible, this is more likely to be accepted by the players than an arbitrary explanation (the dungeon has blue walls so no sleep), and, in fact, clever players might have considered the possibility as soon as they got to know that the dungeon is noisy.<br/><br/>On the other hand, monster hit dice (or level) is fairly disassociated - for big monsters one can use their body mass as some kind of indicator. But what about new and unique undead and demons and such?<br/><br/>Likewise, Adam's mechanic seems fairly disassociated. Is it about fatigue? If so, getting tired, in general, should help one learn, and that should allow getting similar bonuses. Pressure? Does having my boss yell at me give similar bonuses? If magic changes my emotional state, then does it also change the relevant bonuses?<br/><br/>4. Disassociation is partially a matter of not having a good explanation that the participants accept. There is a reason why D&amp;D people have figured out explanations for alignment, hit points (that work as long as poisonous bites are not considered), and so on.<br/><br/>5. Some disassociated mechanics are fairly harmless. These are the ones that do not suggest disruptive behaviour of the characters. Adam's rule is, I guess, fairly harmless in this sense. Giving experience for finishing goals or finding treasure and so on is harmless in this sense, and beneficial for giving structure to the game. Giving experience for killing things (and not overcoming them otherwise) is harmful if one does not want to play a game of monster hunters, because it suggests what is presumably undesired behaviour (seeking and fighting monsters for the sake of doing so).<br/><br/>6. Generally speaking, for traditional games, less disassociated mechanics is better. a. It allows aligning player and character goals. and b. It allows fiction-based problem solving. Many traditional games have elements of both a. and b., in varying degrees.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_477912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477912/#Comment_477912" name="Item_133" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-19T21:11:25+00:00" title="November 19, 2018  9:11PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well said.

Also, combinations thereof - start in one style and change to another as game progresses, or mix and match, etc. <br/> <br/>* Relationships and social play - some of the backgrounds define the character in interesting ways for this. For many players, does not really require mechanical support. This might be a type of princess play, as far as I know. The point is to have player and nonplayer characters with personalities and relationships that are interesting to play.<br/><br/>Also, elements that can be emphasized in various styles:<br/><br/>* Character optimization - mechanical support hopefully obvious.<br/><br/>* Figure chess - mechanical support hopefully obvious.<br/><br/>* Character immersion - the rules tell what characters can do and allow some amount of customization. This support immersion for some people. Others do just fine by focusing on the parts of play that do not really use the rules that much, which does not really require mechanical support as much as lack of mechanical hindrance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_477947">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477947/#Comment_477947" name="Item_136" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-20T20:39:48+00:00" title="November 20, 2018  8:39PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you for starting a new thread!

"What are you willing to fight and kill for?" and so on.<br/><br/>I think that's a style of play that works fine with the RAW, but (as always with any type of play) it only works well if all the players have the same agenda.<br/><br/>With some tweaks to the advancement system, a la my XP rules for Towerlands, you can add some mechanical support to a different style of play pretty easily and still have it be <i>entirely recognizable</i> as D&amp;D and not some other game, as you suggested.<br/><br/>Another style of play that works for most brands of D&amp;D is straight-on Sim / Right to Dream play, especially as "Exploration of Setting" or "Exploration of Genre."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_477958">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" title="ValyrianSteelKatana"><img alt="ValyrianSteelKatana" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477958/#Comment_477958" name="Item_138" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-21T04:30:51+00:00" title="November 21, 2018  4:30AM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a>: I know of more than a few players who ignore the XP system and treat it like a storygame. That\u2019s how I got my start. My go-to game is Savage Worlds, and that\u2019s how I treat the system. New players who <i>aren\u2019t</i> teenage boys looking to kick ass and chew bubblegum pretty much treat trad games like this in my experience\u2014as long as the GM guides them there. This actually works fairly well due to the lack of player-facing mechanics (IMO) because it limits the requisite game knowledge and leans heavily on the GM as \u201cstory guide.\u201d The GM coaxes the players along and prompts them for character actions and dice rolls. In a like-minded group, the culture reinforces and deeds into this. It\u2019s how I learned to play, and it\u2019s how I teach new players to play. Heck, there\u2019s a local theatre group that runs live sessions of Pathfinder that uses this style of play, and that has to be one of the worst systems for it. (I maintain that 3e was a blight on the hobby and is the worst edition of the game. My perspective may be skewed by my introduction to RPGs leaving a most unpleasant aftertaste.)<br/><br/>This method is flawed and prone to destructive behavior because sometimes (often, even) players are taught all the wrong lessons through gameplay. If the GM only allots XP for murderhoboing and treats every interaction as a hostile encounter in a wargame, so too will the players internalize this behavior. It\u2019s a bit like learning bad life lessons, I suppose. My experiences with D&amp;D imparted wisdom and folly alike. As <a href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">@Adam_Dray</a> notes, it\u2019s entirely possible to ignore or alter the XP system as needed so D&amp;D \u201cworks\u201d better for the group, but some players just don\u2019t get it. As an example, I tried to shoehorn character goals and objectives into my 5e game (a l\xe1 Mouseguard). Didn\u2019t work. The players wanted me to strap them in and conduct a scenic rail tour.<br/><br/>Allow me to elaborate (yammer) a bit more on this. I had a similar experience recently playing BitD at a convention. The mechanics immediately made sense to me: I need to take stress to make things happen and I want to put myself in desperate situations. Several other players seemed baffled and confused by the agency afforded to them and the need to proactively engage the mechanics. It was evident they were accustomed to the GM occasionally calling for rolls (probably spicy-style rolls) and settling in for a story. Even when the GM called on them, they refused to do much of anything but wait for things to happen!<br/><br/>I digress with rambling, but I do have a broader point: even with XP triggers laid bare for them to see (and \u201ctouch\u201d),they detached themselves from the reward system in favor of playing from an in-character perspective. \u201cShould I, as my character, take an unnecessary risk and threaten to botch the heist?\u201d From a character perspective, no, of course not. From a mechanical perspective, absolutely. Yet the mechanics made no difference.<br/><br/>To answer your question here:\n<blockquote>I'm still curious to hear if anyone else has seen D&amp;D regularly played in a different style,</blockquote>\nYes.\n<blockquote>in a way which it supports well.</blockquote>\nNo.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_478074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478074/#Comment_478074" name="Item_139" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-25T04:40:25+00:00" title="November 25, 2018  4:40AM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, everyone, I'm back. Along with <a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> , I'm definitely one of the people who has defended 5E the most, so this seems like a good place to jump back in to S-G.<br/><br/>A few general points, and then I want to talk about the most recent 5E campaign I ran.<br/><br/>-Paul is very hung up on lengthy chargen being at odds with meaningfully challengeful play, but I disagree, for two reasons. One, with the app chargen takes only a few minutes, even starting above first level. (A little longer if you're playing a spellcaster, but not much.) Second, more importantly, the game can have meaningful challenge even if actual character death is rare. In this sense, challenge in 5E probably won't be of the "Old-School" type. Failure is likely to lead to betrayal, setbacks, villains growing closer to their goals, *NPC* death, and so on.<br/><br/>-Despite my love of 5E, I do kind of agree that pure RAW 5E sucks. There's a lot of GM-facing stuff missing, the creative agenda is super-muddled (it's <i>definitely</i> trying to be all things to all people), the default XP system is terrible, and so on. Even worse, the RAW for resting is all kinds of bonkers and does, indeed, make actually challenging the PCs tough.<br/><br/>-Especially when it comes to the resource-management (or strategic, as opposed to tactical) level, the resting rules (as-written) can trivialize any challenges that might be incipient. However, even when you fix the resting rules (very easy to do; there are *many* solutions that can work), it is a mistake to think that 5E will ever facilitate resource-management in the truly old-school style. Keeping track of food, water, ropes, light sources, etc., is all pointless, because running out of those things is actively hard to do, and the tracking is actively un-fun. (This is where I differ from Sandra, and <i>possibly</i> Adam [?].) However, there are resources that the game can challenge the PCs to manage: HP, Hit Dice, and spendable character resources (spell slots, ki points, etc.).<br/><br/>-Because of the above two points, I freely acknowledge that, to make 5E work for me, I need to draw heavily on my knowledge of other games, including Dungeon World, Burning Wheel / Mouse Guard, some John Harper stuff, etc. But I'm not on board with saying that what I'm doing "isn't 5E." Just from a purely practical standpoint, you could take someone who's only played RAW, Adventurer's-League 5E, put them at my table, and in under five minutes they'd understand my house rules. I'm not changing any of the game's basic resolution mechanics or math. (Now, whether a given player will <i>like</i> my approach to 5E is a separate question, of course.)<br/><br/>-I totally disagree that 5E stops being challenging above low-level. It's far, far better than 3E in this regard, and arguably only a little worse than 4th. (In that challenges at high levels in 5E are swingier than in 4E, so while still meaningful, a little bit less tactical. Only a little, however.)<br/><br/>-Regardless of what specific set of rules / house-rules you're using, buy-in is absolutely everything. Spending time properly setting up the initial situation so that the PCs are really, truly invested in it is just as important in 5E as in any story game. (The DMG does an at-best mediocre job of pointing this out, of course.) This brings me to the campaign I ran this past spring...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_478077">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478077/#Comment_478077" name="Item_140" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-25T05:05:27+00:00" title="November 25, 2018  5:05AM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, so I decided I wanted to try running some of the material from <i>Tales from the Yawning Portal</i>, a recent 5E product whose format is quite unique: they took 7 modules from prior editions, and 5E-itized them. They do span from 1st level through about 14th or 15th, but it is explicitly not intended that GMs run the players through them one at a time from the beginning.<br/><br/>The 8th-level dungeon, <i>White Plume Mountain</i>, is a classic "funhouse" dungeon; it is literally "a wizard did it." Meanwhile, the 9th/10th dungeon is some really complicated puzzle dungeon whose premise I found incomprehensible and uninteresting, so I skipped that. But WPM is all about acquiring three artifact-level weapons, one of which is particularly good for fighting Giants... so I decided we should also do <i>Against the Giants</i>, which officially starts at 11th level. AtG is more serious and "gritty" than WPM, and actually consists of three linked dungeons.<br/><br/>I worked with my players to develop a premise where it would really make sense for them to want to do WPM. They came up with serving the king of a small nation, breakaway rebels from a large and awful empire. (We used Greyhawk as the setting.) This king wanted the three artifacts before he formally declared independence, so he could defend his borders as needed. The PCs, crucially, all had various personal reasons for wanting the nation, or at least its king, to succeed.<br/><br/>I told them out of game that, if we were all still having fun after WPM, we'd do AtG as well, but their characters didn't know that. What I did was that, on the way home from WPM, they essentially ran into AtG, and found that their nation was now threatened by giants, so they were motivated to solve this second adventure (plus they'd already bought into it on an OOC level).<br/><br/>The game was an immense amount of fun. Even though we started at 8th level, and ended around 11th, it (a) felt quite epic and dynamic, and (b) was often quite challenge-ful; there were many suspenseful die rolls and the like. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that the design of the game was "focused" (in the Forgean sense) on the challenge of these two (really four) dungeons. <br/><br/>The key to making the dungeon-bashing interesting was my players' creation of an entertaining PC party, with cross-connections, complicated relationships, squabbles, and so on. My house rules for 5E, meanwhile, which are focused on BIFTs and skill roll failures, not only facilitated this entertaining intra-party dynamic, but also helped it not to stay static: the characters' feelings about each other evolved over time, in response to in-game actions. Two of the five original PCs ended up leaving; their players brought in new characters, and we worked together to make sure they'd still be closely tied to the group. A sixth character joined towards the end (the "visiting long-distance girlfriend" phenomenon), and she ended up as a wonderful foil to one of the original PCs.<br/><br/>Also, the two players who didn't end up with super-weapons for their characters were tasked with roleplaying the artifacts' personalities as, essentially, secondary characters. (I played the third artifact.) This helped keep the spotlight balanced, even as three of the five characters soared in power level relative to the other two in a strictly numerical sense. It also helps that 5E cares a great deal about action economy, and has flatter math than 3rd or 4th edition, so those two PCs never felt extraneous.<br/><br/>It was one of the most fun games I've run in a long time, and probably my single most successful D&amp;D GMing experience. We laughed a whole lot; the game was not particularly serious or morally challenging. But it never devolved into total gonzo silliness, because there was a real, player-authored fictional premise underlying the adventuring, and because Greyhawk is a setting with a good deal of political plausibility built in. We played around 15 sessions, I think, but covered about as much ground as many much longer D&amp;D campaigns would have.<br/><br/>No matter what, it's undeniable that the rules of 5E, even if they were filtered through my rather peculiar prism, were absolutely a core component of the fun we had. We could, of course, have attempted the same campaign premise with an OSR D&amp;D game, or even something completely different like FATE, Savage Worlds, or Burning Wheel. Those games might have been fun as well! But the particular <i>way</i> that this game was fun and memorable was very much a product of 5E's ruleset interacting with what we wanted to do with the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_478079">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478079/#Comment_478079" name="Item_141" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-25T05:41:40+00:00" title="November 25, 2018  5:41AM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 25, 2018 5:45AM by Paul_T.">edited November 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a great breakdown, Matt. I think that the only difference in opinion (sadly, likely an unresolvable one) is whether it is justifiable to attribute this sort of success to the design of the game vs. your own tweaks and GMing skills (including knowledge of other games). Like I said, I don't see how to resolve that argument, so it's almost certainly not worth having, but the fact remains that I - a fairly knowledgeable gamer - feel very low confidence about being able to design and implement similar changes to the game to what you have done (reworking the entire XP system essentially, making rules as well as GM procedures which leverage BIFTs meaningfully, and finding a way to balance rests/encounter balance with consistency). My sense is that it would take a LOT of unsuccessful play to get there (possibly several years?). Perhaps that would be different if I were simply to grab all of your house rules; I don't know.<br/><br/>I love the nuanced portrayal of the game you've done here, and the way you breakdown various issues and strengths.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I'm unlikely to ever participate in D&amp;D5 play much largely on aesthetic grounds (the D&amp;D-ness of D&amp;D5 fantasy just bores me to tears at this point, and these new rules bake those assumptions in HARD - * <i>see bottom of post</i>), but I also see many positive features about its design, and would probably choose it over, say, D&amp;D3 or AD&amp;D, if I had to.<br/><br/>Aside from the major issues you've brought up here (if I'm not mistaken, that's the XP system, support for BIFTs, and reworking resting/recovery), here are a few problems with the structure of modern D&amp;D which have come up in this thread, or in my private chats with you, or games of D&amp;D I have observed. How do you address these (or prevent them from being an issue)?<br/><br/>* The heavy focus on combat and combat-related powers, rules, and abilities, in combination with XP for combat and constantly selling a plethora of enemies to fight, leads players and groups inexorably into fight after fight. Making a game out of modern D&amp;D which makes combat or war a veritable choice, rather than an assumed event, seems to go against the grain. (Of course, if your game is intended to go from fight to fight, no problem.)<br/><br/>* Character creation is colourful, intensive, time-consuming, and creates strong buy-in on the part of the player: even a 1st-level character (in contrast to OSR D&amp;D, for example) seems like a real Hero, with lots of cool powers and striking Colour. When character death is a real possibility, this seems like it can cause a problem for people - at the very least, a mismatch of expectations. There's no real option for a quick, random character generation you don't buy into very much, if that would serve your game better.<br/><br/>(This is another example of where modern D&amp;D's Colour is an issue for me - and I recognize that this a very personal concern most people do not share. I like being able to say, "Hey, now let's play the servants at the manor, as the demon/Orc invasion arrives"... however, D&amp;D5's incredibly colourful character options make that pretty difficult. A Dragonborn Wild Sorcerer and a Tiefling Druid who can breathe fire are almost impossible to reenvision as common servants, sailors, apprentices at a magic school, caravan guards, merchants... for my tastes, this limits the possibilities of the kinds of games and stories I can play far too much. But, like I say - that's a personal taste thing, and clearly not important to many other people who love the game.)<br/><br/>* If, like you say, the game features a lot of challenge and the real possibility of failure, but without the danger of character death, how does one arrange that? What kinds of game structures, procedures, adventure design, etc, allow to maintain a game style where real challenge exists but character death isn't on the table?<br/><br/>Again, it seems to me that the default "challenge mode" in D&amp;D5 is of the martial encounter, which, without some "fixing of the contest", generally ends in death for the loser. Is this not so?<br/><br/>How have you arranged for this consistently - what are the tips and tricks?<br/><br/>* Using hardcore "story game" prep with BIFTs seems like a solid way to go - at least, if all the players involved understand the process and can buy into it. However, the default structure of the D&amp;D "party" seems to work against that. I've heard a number of D&amp;D GMs who attempt to run a more "story game" style run up against this problem: <br/><br/>So long as character priorities align, it can work great (in combination, especially, with some kind of rotating spotlight system, whether explicit or not). However, if the game features difficult moral choices based on character details, and full player freedom to address those, the reality of different characters having different priorities rears its head.<br/><br/>Either the players have to maneuver awkwardly to avoid any kind of inter-PC disagreement/conflict, or the game starts to suffer from a lot of player bickering (over whether the "party" should pursue one PC's current highest priority or another's).<br/><br/>Neither seems to work well with "standard" "story game prep" a la Sorcerer or what-have-you. (At least, that's what I've seen.)<br/><br/>(In successful games I've observed, Participationism tends to be the solution. Which leads me to:)<br/><br/>* The fairly involved prep required on the GM's side, again, provides incentives to buy in strongly to particular prep. For most GMs, this means getting locked into the prep they have done, and steering the game that way - most people simply don't have the time or attention to prep an extensive sandbox in D&amp;D5. (Sure, it's better, perhaps, than D&amp;D 3e/4e, but OSR-style D&amp;D, PbtA games, and other alternatives blow that out of the water.)<br/><br/>That creates pressures to put the "game on rails" on the GM side, as well, in my experience.<br/><br/>(Matt, I know that *you* are likely capable of handling a lot of these things very fast and very economically - you are extremely intelligent, capable of absorbing large quantities or rules really quickly, and so on - but I see people struggle with this all the time. Again, I'm a pretty experienced roleplayer who's played D&amp;D a lot, and yet the handful of times I created a 1st level D&amp;D5 character, it took me about an hour and a half, and I still had things to look up and correct afterwards. If I were invited to a high-lethality game where my character could die pretty easily, I'm not sure I could sign up for that kind of work every time it happened - I'd be sitting at the table still working long after the session was done!)<br/><br/><br/><br/><i><br/><br/>* about how the game bakes in its Colour HARD: I'd be happy to discuss this, if anyone wants to hear more, but absent prompting I will keep it out of this thread.

Even more than tweaking the rules for BIFTS and skill rolls, changing how XP works seems like a fundamental design decision that will greatly alter the experience of at-the-table play. I'm assuming you houseruled XP. If I'm correct, in what way did you do so?<br/><br/>Paul - per your last point, I'd love a new thread for that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_478084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478084/#Comment_478084" name="Item_143" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-25T08:07:37+00:00" title="November 25, 2018  8:07AM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 25, 2018 8:10AM by DeReel.">edited November 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> Just to correct : "Martial contest without death for the loser" is practiced by humanity since dawn of time.

In D&amp;D, defeat pretty much always comes when you run out of hit points. So, with the exception of the (rather generous) "knock them out at 0 HP" rule, which I'm not sure why opponents would use unless they always sought to capture the PCs (and even then, I'm not sure how that rule works against PCs), making combats end in a loss for the PCs that is not death requires some careful thought and/or shenanigans, it seems to me. <br/><br/>An example of a combat which has stakes other than death: monsters or enemies are trying to get into the castle (to do some nefarious deed). There is a bridge, where the heroes are making their last stand, so they face off. <br/><br/>In many other games, there is some kind of conflict resolution procedure, and we might learn that the monsters overwhelm the PCs and make it into the castle. In D&amp;D, however, what incentive do the PCs have to stop fighting before they reach 0 HP? They're likely to fight on and die. Conversely, if the monsters are winning the fight, what incentive do they have NOT to kill the PCs? <br/><br/>I'm sure arranging interesting combats with stakes that are not about death is *possible*, but it's not exactly obvious (at least, not to me).<br/><br/>But maybe I'm missing something!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_478086">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478086/#Comment_478086" name="Item_145" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-25T08:57:30+00:00" title="November 25, 2018  8:57AM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hans:<br/><br/>I assume you mean my comments about Colour? I already touched on some examples, above, so I can really quickly summarize here, I think.<br/><br/>The game includes a lot of very "colourful" and evocative sets of descriptions and powers, even at 1st level. For instance, I regularly see characters in 5th Edition D&amp;D who are a described as a "Red Dragonborn Oathbreaker Paladin", or a "Tiefling Eldritch Knight"... things like that. It's less dramatic than some other versions of D&amp;D, but...<br/><br/>In comparison, truly old-school D&amp;D would say you're a "Fighting Man" or a "Magic-User", and the rest was up to you: are you an old wizard? A gladiator? A scrappy street urchin? A soldier down on his luck? Lots of room for interpretation here.<br/><br/>Like I mentioned earlier, in old-school D&amp;D it's no problem to say that our characters are all going to be cabin boys aboard a ship traveling the high seas. In D&amp;D5, though? Well...<br/><br/>The first time I made a D&amp;D character, the party I was joining wanted some kind of spellcaster. I looked over the list, and the idea of a Sorcerer seemed interesting. I thought maybe I could play a dark twist on the stereotypical "aging fantasy wizard". Great.<br/><br/>However, then I discover that a Sorcerer needs high Charisma as a spell-casting stat, and to be effective I should have a high Charisma score. There are only a few races which give a bonus to Charisma, and a couple grant such a significant bonus (+2) that everyone is encouraging me to choose one of those races. Fine, I choose to be a Tiefling. What's that? I look it up and it means I have demonic heritage, and horns, and I smell of sulphur. Whoa. Well, ok.<br/><br/>Next, I'm writing up my character and it turns out that I need to choose an origin for my powers, and the two choices are "Draconic" or "Wild Magic". So, either I deal with unpredictable and dangerous powers (which, among other things, tends to rule out, for instance, very careful spell use or stealthy spell use - no magical assassins here, at least not unless you have a lot of room for unpredictable failures <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> ), or my character is descended from a dragon, and will breathe fire and eventually grow dragon wings.<br/><br/>Now suddenly my character has demonic heritage, some strange magical powers which come from the underworld (e.g. Hellish Rebuke), is going to breathe fire, grow dragon wings, or deal with Wild Magic and thereby turn his hair blue and summon extraplanar creatures by accident...<br/><br/>If I was hoping to be a slightly twisted street urchin who plays a lot of poker and learned a spell or two from his dead foster father's ancient books... well, the game has taken me into an entirely different direction. Then I pick my Background and I end up with an animal for a pet, as well...<br/><br/>There are some more standard formats available, of course, but, especially given splatbooks and expansions and the size of a typical D&amp;D party, you're likely to get a number of such characters in any game unless you very specifically make an effort to limit available character choices to the group.<br/><br/>This is no way a criticism of the game on any objective grounds; I just find it limiting for my personal tastes. It's pretty hard to end up with a game that looks anything like <i>Lord of the Rings</i>, or <i>Game of Thrones</i>, or any other fantasy world or property I can think of (except China Mieville, perhaps): instead, the default is that we get a mish-mash of highly stylized races, classes, and powers.<br/><br/>Hopefully this post doesn't derail this thread; my personal tastes in character creation and fantasy settings really shouldn't be of too much interest to anyone. But this limits the utility of the game to me a great deal - I have to like this kind of modern D&amp;D Colour, severely limit character creation choices, or get out.<br/><br/>I'm more interested in the ongoing discussion of how to make aspects of the game work well in terms of gameplay; it's my hope that the thread keeps moving in that direction rather than taking a detour.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_478087">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478087/#Comment_478087" name="Item_146" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-25T09:05:23+00:00" title="November 25, 2018  9:05AM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 25, 2018 9:15AM by DeReel.">edited November 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Of course, I just wanted to make sure the second part of your statement (that martial encounters end in death of the loser) was directed at D&amp;D like the first part (that the game sets up these encounters).

Not only did you have no input over the game's premise\u2014even moderately-skilled GMs know to do a session zero these days\u2014they even directed you to play a particular type of character, and that was a spellcaster, a poor choice for someone worried about length of chargen. On top of that, they advised you poorly, resulting in you ending up with a character concept you weren't invested in.<br/><br/>Honestly, if I had to come up with a worse way to introduce someone to 5E, I'm not sure I could do it.<br/><br/>I do think you're right that the general aesthetic of a bunch of non-human weirdos, rather than mostly humans with a few demihumans \xe0 la Tolkien, <i>is</i> a real aesthetic thing. My own games tend to trend towards more "Tolkienesque" parties (if not majority human, then majority "usual" D&amp;D races), for the simple reason that my players' preferences run in that direction.<br/><br/>I actually think my player base has as much to do with my 5E success as my own brilliance, in fact. One of the things I'll talk more about in my separate post, but which I'll mention now: I actually don't prep much directly related to people's BIFTs, but since Inspiration is so good, my players are motivated to play off their own and each other's BIFTs all the damn time.<br/><br/>Having players who are creative and mostly GMs themselves is not really optional to forming a good ongoing gaming group, for any game, but particularly one that can drag if the players don't deliberately bring the characterization.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_478152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478152/#Comment_478152" name="Item_157" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-26T19:45:34+00:00" title="November 26, 2018  7:45PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt,<br/><br/>While you are right that there were some negatives aspects to that particular game, that wasn't my point in writing about it. In the end, I was actually pretty excited about the character, and exploring some of the interesting mechanical options available via Sorcery (Metamagic) and Wild Magic. I didn't feel my hand was forced at any step along the way.<br/><br/>I was bringing up that particular character in response to Hans's question about how modern D&amp;D has more Colour baked into its procedures than earlier editions. It's a perfect illustration.<br/><br/>In early versions of D&amp;D, many of the details are either generic and neutral in format (e.g. classes like "Fighting Man" and "Magic-User", can be interpreted in a number of ways) or specific reference to historical or real-world details (e.g. becoming Lord of a Keep, the equipment lists, and most character details except for spells and the Tolkienesque races - Elves, Hobbits, Dwarves).<br/><br/>It's not at all hard to create a game like Lord of the Rings, where a group of hobbits go to adventure out in a basic fantasy world. A hobbit can be a Fighting-Man, sure, and it's easy to imagine that as simply describing a more stalward or direct hobbit than the others.<br/><br/>In "middle school" D&amp;D, we started to have a lot more specific character creation options, like the various "kits", but many of these still referenced real world things - you could be a Corsair or a Samurai or a Templar Knight. These were all also optional.<br/><br/>I find that, in comparison, "modern" D&amp;D bakes a lot of assumptions about the genre and style of play into character generation, monster stats, and so forth. The way character balance and powers work, stat generation, the way races interact with your stats, and many other details mean that you end up with, as you write:\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" rel="nofollow">Deliverator</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>But personally I find it annoying that the game officially allows any race / class combo, while heavily punishing people who choose one of the many "wrong" ones.<br/><br/>[...]<br/> <br/>The purpose of this rule is to solve the problem of "suboptimal" race / class combos. Paul might not like this one, as it actually encourages the party of Kenku Paladin + Tabaxi Wizard + Gnome Barbarian + Dragonborn Rogue sort of nonsense. <img alt=":smiley:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title=":smiley:"/></p></div></blockquote>\nWhen I play OSR-style D&amp;D, it's easy to envision a character just about any way I like. My character is a young woman disguised as a cabin boy on a corsair ship? No problem. Being a "fighting man" could mean just about anything, and I don't *need* any particular set of stats to make that choice "workable". I roll up stats and my Shakespearean corsair pirate cabin boy is ready to go. This means a variety of fictional setups, adventures, and campaigns is possible, without too much effort.<br/><br/>In "modern" D&amp;D I try to make a character and I end up with a demonic heritage, which means I have a tail and horns, can call upon the powers of Hell to punish my enemies in battle, resistance to fire, and - in addition! - I'm also half-dragon, and will soon be able to breathe fire and grow dragon wings. This is all without consciously trying to seek these features out.<br/><br/>Yikes! Could this person believably disguise herself as a cabin boy?<br/><br/>These things aren't referents to classic fantasy literature or medieval Earth; all these details tend to create, as you say, "a party of Kenku Paladin + Tabaxi Wizard + [...]". The game foists a great deal of fictional details which are purely based in D&amp;D itself - and not even "classic" D&amp;D (e.g. Beholders) but a modern conception of weird fantasy ideas like Dragonborn, Warforged, Tieflings, and so forth.<br/><br/>This is no way good or bad design at any objective level - in fact, I suspect most young D&amp;D fans love this stuff! - but it's very offputting to ME, personally, and I don't like how much it limits my options for creating settings, campaigns, characters, and adventurers that resonate with me and I'm interested in seeing in play.<br/><br/>(This also happens in other ways, beyond character creation: for instance, the way combat has been reworked for 5th Edition, "normal" actions and attacks have been reduced in effective value - e.g. daggers still deal 1d4 damage, but hit points for everyone have been increased - to make room for the various special powers, spells, abilities, and effects. This means that combat tends to be dominated by the powers which are granted by character builds, special abilities, and so forth. A "typical" D&amp;D5 combat will have people saying a lot more things like "I use my Hellish Rebuke as a reaction" and a lot less "let's grab those barrels and roll them down at the tavern guards" or "I throw a milk jug at him" than earlier editions of D&amp;D (at least before 3E). This all contributes to a certain feel to the game and the fiction it creates, and lends a certain D&amp;D-with-video-game-influences Colour to all the proceedings.)<br/><br/>Hans, hopefully that answers your question. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_478169">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478169/#Comment_478169" name="Item_158" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-27T04:03:53+00:00" title="November 27, 2018  4:03AM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a>, don't forget that I ran a 5e campaign (City of Brass) based on the idea that 1st level characters were totally down on their luck and were forced into a menial existence as squatters -- far worse off than cabin boys.

Nothing wrong with that per se, sure, but also not very appealing to me... I'd rather give up the sword n' leather boots trappings and play the exact same campaign as some flavor of science fiction, then (cyberpunk, post-apoc, space travel or whatever).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_478193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478193/#Comment_478193" name="Item_163" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-27T18:26:26+00:00" title="November 27, 2018  6:26PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 27, 2018 6:29PM by Hans_c-o.">edited November 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul: You've answered it in spades.

I agree with you about how it all works, naturally, but since I never played D&amp;D until about 2007, the strongly baked-in color to characters seemed as natural as the blue sky. In fact, as I read you describe all the creativity one can put into a "Fighting Man" to make it a young woman disguised as a cabin boy on a corsair ship, I realize that I never really considered that. I just assumed "Fighting Man" meant you were one of a few obvious things: soldier, pit fighter, day laborer who brawls in taverns, etc. - and almost certainly a <i>man</i>, at that!

It's purely a question of taste. (Some people equate fantasy mish-mash with low quality art, but I don't think it has to be that way - for example, China Mieville is arguably a pretty "gonzo" writer but considered to be an author with depth and nuance.)<br/><br/>However, it's changed a lot over time, and it's something which makes it difficult for me to be drawn to "modern D&amp;D". D&amp;D players seem to be used to this and to accept it freely (as <a href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">@Hans_c-o</a> says, above).<br/><br/>Here's a comparison; perhaps this will be instructive. Here's an illustration of a D&amp;D adventuring party from the 80's (I believe it was in the Player's Handbook):<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.larryelmore.com/core/imgs/prints/Dragon-Slayers-and-Proud.jpg"/><br/><br/>Here's an illustration of a D&amp;D adventuring party in 5th Edition:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b0/0c/21/b00c211170c1dc722801b9f0cd0ff010.jpg"/><br/><br/>The former puts me in the mood for classic fantasy adventure, romance, magic, mysteries, and medievalism. I start thinking of Tolkien, or Game of Thrones, or other bits of media which I find enjoyable and exciting.<br/><br/>The latter... I can't relate to at all in terms of artistic inspiration. For instance, I recently watched a bit of Critical Role, and I watched a combat scene which involved:<br/><br/>A blue dragon/snake hybrid which fired lightning from its maw, fighting a motley crew:<br/><br/>* A half-dragon sorcerer floating in the air<br/>* A "force of nature" druid who can and does turn herself into an eagle or a snow leopard, stalking through the snow<br/>* Two twin half-elves, one a ranger and the other an assassin<br/>* A man who has invited gunpowder firearms, and carries several high-powered guns<br/>* A singing gnome bard<br/>* A blue-skinned enormous half-giant kind of fellow with an axe<br/>* A pet bear <br/><br/>At the conclusion of the fight, they collected some scales from the creature, which they could use to make armour which would be resistant to lightning damage (!). Oh, and they are on their way to fight some vampires, by the way.<br/><br/>To a D&amp;D player, all of this is, in some ways, fairly familiar, after getting used to it over time.<br/><br/>However, I can't think of any other media (books, movies, television), except for cartoons, perhaps, that has this range of strange fantastic elements all jammed together into a single scene. Send that script to a movie producer, and they'll likely think you're out of your mind. (Even the most wildly whimsical properties like <i>Harry Potter</i> or <i>Star Wars</i> have a lot more thematic coherence - sure, you know to expect just about any alien you can imagine, but you would be quite shocked if you saw a <b>vampire</b> in the next Star Wars film! You can easily judge for yourself that it doesn't belong. In Lord of the Rings, there are weird races like Elves and Dwarves and Orcs, but they all reflect some theme of the story and the setting. And so on.)<br/><br/>This means that it's incredibly difficult to create the kind of fantasy world/story/setting I'm interested in or inspired by with these rules. That alone keeps me from reaching for D&amp;D a lot of the time, and that's unfortunate.<br/><br/>It's not just a vague knee-jerk reaction, either: I also have all kinds of gameplay concerns, practical concerns about getting the game I want out of these rules. For instance, consider the kind of story where a group plans a heist and dresses up as the serving staff at a tavern or small keep. Perhaps the PCs are part of a group trying to infiltrate or arrange a political scheme, like the Red Wedding in <i>Game of Thrones</i>.<br/><br/>Can you imagine the characters in the photo, above, infiltrating the Red Wedding? <br/><br/>No.<br/><br/>To even consider that a possibility, I must either create a setting of unbelievable mish-mash (like a Star Wars canteen scene - every population in my world must now be an incredible kaleidoscope of colourful creatures) or include other wild things like common illusion magic, which, logically, ought to transform the setting so much as to make envisioning an event like the Red Wedding nearly impossible in the first place.<br/><br/>I know it's a matter of personal preference, but it gets to me. I'm tempted to play D&amp;D5 these days, for a variety of reasons (and these threads are a big part of that), but the work involved in dealing with these aspects of the design is a huge stumbling block for me. That's unfortunate.<br/><br/>Does that make me a weirdo, or lacking in "nerd credibility"? I don't know.

Why would you choose this game over others, Paul? I considered many for the kind of campaign I want to run, including many OSR-style games, 4e, Strike! RPG, and a few others. I concluded 5e was best. I can think of a few reasons, which is why I continue to tinker with it:<br/><br/>1. You want an action-adventure fantasy roleplaying game, where action mostly means fighting monsters, where characters progress in power (where power progression is in a linear relationship to setting impact). I'm designing a campaign explicitly based on the XP assumptions of the core books: XP only for defeating monsters. The PCs can spend a session politicking all they want, and I'd be happy to run that. But no XP. This is me taking the rules at face value and reverse-engineering the setting from it: If people get more powerful by defeating monsters, what does that mean? (I have answers for it in my setting that drive play). <br/><br/>2. You want it easily hackable. 5e is explicitly designed for this. I cannot imagine running 5e without hacking 10-30% of the game. "Hacking" also means, of course, omitting things you dislike (for me, it's the Gnome and the Perception, Persuasion, Insight, and Investigation skills; for Paul, it might be the Dragonborn* and Tiefling* and Drow*, and allowing the player to reskin the Draconic Sorcerer). I thought an OSR-style game with tactical combat would be best for the campaign I want to run, and then I realized that 5e is the best game for that (hacked, obviously). It's easier to cut away cruft that fights against OSR-style and keep the tactical combat system rather than start with B/X or something and design a tactical combat system.<br/><br/>3. It is ubiquitous. If you're looking to play a PC, you'll likely be able to find a table that fits your style. If you're looking to GM, you'll likely be able to find a group of players who accept your houserules and want to play the type of game you want to run.<br/><br/>If I were trying to run a Deliverator-style game I still think I'd shove off from 5e and pick something else like Dungeon World. My campaign will probably excise BIFTs altogether.<br/><br/>*In fact the PHB calls out these races and a few others, including my hated Gnome, as "less common" in the "multiverses" of D&amp;D, and only in the game at the DM's discretion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_478653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Trent_W" title="Trent_W"><img alt="Trent_W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Trent_W">Trent_W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478653/#Comment_478653" name="Item_168" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-06T15:16:14+00:00" title="December  6, 2018  3:16PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" rel="nofollow">Hans_c-o</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>2.

I would enjoy reading it!<br/><br/>It's funny, because all these threads about 5E are giving me thoughts, as well. <br/><br/>Similar thoughts: like, maybe I want to run my own 5E game. I don't know what it would look like yet, however. <br/><br/>Deliverator-style, like you say, seems odd. Why not use a more story-oriented or dramatically-oriented game? <br/><br/>Doing something OSRish seems crazy to me in a similar way: something in the vein of an older edition of D&amp;D seems far better for that.<br/><br/>But there is a game in there for me, too, perhaps... I'm thinking about it.<br/><br/>Your own reasons for choosing the ruleset don't speak to me - I don't see what makes the game hackable at all (so I look forward to hearing about that!), and "finding players" isn't really a consideration, either. Your <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> is correct, though. If you want to play D&amp;D it should be precisely because you like al those things that are specific to D&amp;D, and that's classes and level progression and the particular spell lists and so forth. (And probably some nostalgia or other desire for the familiar.)<br/><br/>A side note on excising the overly "colourful" races:<br/><br/>If that's what you guys think would make D&amp;D interesting to me in terms of Colour, I didn't explain myself earlier. It's not just that. It's how that stuff is baked in at every level of the game:<br/><br/>The inflexibility of character generation. (My character can't be a kid who's a baker's apprentice. Or even a Ranger who doesn't cast spells.) The need for character builds (which means that your need to be a certain race to play a certain class, if your table is at all competitive in terms of effectiveness). The assumptions about how gods and religion function. The need for high-powered opposition which makes it hard to scale the game down (e.g. at many points your opponents need magical abilities or you're working against all sorts of design assumptions), and, for similar reasons, an expectation and a need for magical gear for the PCs. The way combat takes a long time to play out and is, essentially, about each character and monster firing off their special abilities one by one.

It has largely abandoned those tropes.<br/><br/>It's a superhero game with superheroic tropes largely masquerading as a mid/high-magic fantasy setting.<br/><br/>Every member of the party is very visually distinct. Every member of the party has a special power, and everyone that looks mostly like that member of the party shares that special power. You don't run stories about building emotional connections with other people and having those threatened, not because the mechanics don't support them (though they really don't) but because the only threat that exists within the context of people creating narratives is "do you die?" Everything is existential. (I would note that such makes for some of the most boring stories and yet so easy to put together.)<br/><br/>Now, obviously some of these tropes are directly connected to those which resonate with "old school D&amp;D" as it's evolved. But honestly, taken as a whole and ending up where we're at \u2013 I am surprisingly reminded in this course of analysis that old-school Vampire at a certain point turned into "Trench Coats and Katanas: Superheroes at Night." Perhaps the same process has occurred to D&amp;D to make 5th "Wands and Dagger Throwing: Superheroic Dungeons."<br/><br/>Taken in that light, it's not surprising that not everybody is on board. If I want to run what is effectively a superheroic RPG set in a fantasy world, D&amp;D is probably almost the exact wrong system to do so with. But it's the one that a lot of people know. If you don't want to run superheroic dungeon crawlers, if you want something that hews back to more traditional examples of the genre, D&amp;D 5th Edition doesn't do that. It doesn't want to do that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_478668">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478668/#Comment_478668" name="Item_171" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-06T19:14:58+00:00" title="December  6, 2018  7:14PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            SquidLord,<br/><br/>Yes, well put.

To clarify, I mean "easily hackable" within a certain fairly strict bandwidth of what D&amp;D does. You can easily hack it to play in a more old-school fashion (3d6 in order, cut out certain skills, track death saves taken for the character until they reach a limit and die for good, give XP for treasure, do side initiative, give monsters more damage dice), or you can easily hack it to play in a more 4e fashion (give monsters Bloodied abilities and import other 4e abilities to monsters, import Skill Challenges), or you can easily hack it to curate your specific vision of D&amp;D fantasy (no X races, no Y classes, we're not playing with these 5 spells, point buy chargen).<br/><br/>I say it's easy because, if you know about those things and want to import them as rules into your game, it's easy AND it doesn't break anything, since the system is not a tightly-designed mechanism in the way that something like Burning Wheel is. You'll notice that a few of the examples of hacking I posted are just options in the core game. "Do it like this, or if you want, do it like this, or here's another weird option in the DMG if you want to try that (and implied: if you want, do it another way of your own design once you have some experience with the game).<br/><br/>5e will never be all things to all people, but it can be many things to most people, with GM-side design work. Whether that GM-side design work to get the game one wants is a feature or bug is in the eye of the iconic proprietary monster.<br/><br/>But! Consider that an emergent property of GMing D&amp;D is becoming a game designer. That's pretty cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_478678">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478678/#Comment_478678" name="Item_174" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-07T00:07:49+00:00" title="December  7, 2018 12:07AM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" rel="nofollow">Hans_c-o</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I say it's easy because, if you know about those things and want to import them as rules into your game, it's easy AND it doesn't break anything, since the system is not a tightly-designed mechanism in the way that something like Burning Wheel is.</p></div></blockquote>\nThis is a big reason why I run 5E more often than BW these days, even though I love BW. That, and the fact that 5E has a lower frustration factor (though it <i>can</i> still be quite frustrating / punishing, the way I run it). Meanwhile, it's much more mechanically fun and interesting than Dungeon World, which I also love, but am kind of sick of.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>What do you mean, Paul, about classes having restrictions? (You could certainly remove certain classes without breaking the game. I ran an all-Wizards game for awhile, and also a game where no spellcasting classes at all were in the game.)<br/><br/>One interesting thing about the race / class combos is that, even by total RAW, human is always an optimal option. The people you played with, Paul, were just morons who didn't understand that or point it out as an option. The only thing needed for a race / class combo to be viable is that you start with a 16 in your main stat. With my rules, with the floaters, any race / class combo is doable. But with the PHB rules, while there are some combos that are just not good, like Gnome Barbarians, <i>human is always a good option</i>. Many people would argue that it is, in fact, always strictly best, from a power-gaming point of view, to be a Variant Human, because of the free Feat... and I'd be hard-pressed to disagree.<br/><br/>The new subclasses in Xanathar's Guide to Everything, by the way, do a lot to flesh out the range of possible character concepts. Paladin who wants to seek peace rather than war? Done. Non-magical Ranger? Done. (Not technically a Ranger, but a subclass of Rogue called Scout.) Non-evil Death Cleric? In there. Oh, and a bunch of Sorcerer options far less stupid than Wild Mage, and less... specific... than Draconic.<br/><br/>By the way, I'm... not sure why you think it's not possible to have a character be a baker's apprentice. Even if there's not a specific Background in the book that exactly fits your character concept, just make one up: every Background is two skills, two languages and/or tool proficiencies, some non-combat / setting ability, and some equipment. If I had a player tell me they wanted to be the child of a baker, then, sure.<br/><br/>I keep hammering on these points because I really genuinely think the people who taught you to play 5E misinformed you quite badly as to some specific things about chargen. And sure, the average person isn't as adept as I am at making rule changes and using the system to its best advantage, but most of the things I'm pointing out are right there in the book.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>The superhero thing, however, I do agree with. 5E parties do tend to resemble superhero teams, and probably would even if the "weird" races (and even some of the more exotic classes, like Warlock) were excised. I've never been into superhero comics, but I'm deeply into the movies and TV shows (both DC and Marvel in the latter case), so this doesn't bother me. <br/><br/>Specifically, in the superhero stories I'm into, there is a ton of room for interpersonal drama, hamming it up, and even characters changing over time, albeit in fairly broad strokes sorts of ways. Leaning on the BIFTs the way I do\u2014well, I hadn't thought of it before, but it does a reasonably good job of producing that sort of party dynamic: they're still a team, but they might fight over things, or someone's personal weaknesses might screw over the entire group at a crucial moment, and then there will be fallout from that.<br/><br/>Even 5E games I've been in but not run, and without extensive houseruling, that are in even moderately competent hands, tend to resemble that kind of fiction, just with a dungeon setting. My rules are really just designed to push the game more in that direction, with a strong dose of in-fiction problem solving as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_478683">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478683/#Comment_478683" name="Item_175" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-07T06:21:13+00:00" title="December  7, 2018  6:21AM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 7, 2018 6:22AM by Hans_c-o.">edited December 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/SquidLord">@SquidLord</a> I also agree that you've basically nailed it with the superhero analogy. There's <i>something</i> about that comparison that doesn't sit well with me, but it's probably just the other tropes of superhero fiction that D&amp;D doesn't employ (like that normal people can't just become supers by trying, but people become PCs by just deciding to; there's no level 1 Superman or Wolverine, frex), which is simply a part of the translation from the "Here and Now" setting of supers to the fantastical pseudo-medieval setting of D&amp;D.<br/><br/>It's like, player characters become superheros, but the rest of the world doesn't necessarily operate on superheroic tropes.

There's <i>something</i> about that comparison that doesn't sit well with me, but it's probably just the other tropes of superhero fiction that D&amp;D doesn't employ (like that normal people can't just become supers by trying, but people become PCs by just deciding to; there's no level 1 Superman or Wolverine, frex), which is simply a part of the translation from the "Here and Now" setting of supers to the fantastical pseudo-medieval setting of D&amp;D.</p></div></blockquote>\nExcept that normal people become superheroes all the time and superhero settings simply by trying. Batman is sort of the ur-example. A brush with tragedy in his youth pushes him into training himself to the pinnacle of human capability in certain ways, coupled with a native intelligence and emotional ruthlessness. If anything, Batman may exemplify the sort of superhero trope tradition that D&amp;D has hooked into the hardest.<br/><br/>Of course, Batman is probably a PC.<br/><br/>Pointing out that the level progression of D&amp;D doesn't really resonate with superheroic tropes doesn't work either, really. How many games go ahead and say, "start at level 10?" And how many superhero stories start with a street-level origin story with a long arc that culminates in being a respected vigilante/superhero? (Hint: Spider-Man is probably a good place to start.)<br/><br/>Now, which direction most of those tropes have flown over the last decade of evolution of both genre of stories is something that several people could get thesis papers out of on a regular basis \u2013 because there has obviously been some transference, in part because the audience for both have significant overlaps, and also because everybody likes to nick successful setups.<br/><br/>In the modern fantasy D&amp;D-derived set of literature, part of the problem is that the setting really does run on a lot of superheroic tropes. Since the PCs are superheroes, their opponents end up being superheroes a lot of the time. Forget despotic kings, doublecrossing dukes, and the like \u2013 the current crop of enemies is more likely to be an ancient undead Lich, an incredibly powerful necromancer, a rogue wizard, a dark god-empowered death night, or so on. There seems to be a surprising lack of dungeons in Dungeons &amp; Dragons these days because superheroes generally don't go into deadly labyrinths just to make a buck, nor do they lead armies of lesser men into battle on behalf of goodness and righteousness (or greed and power consolidation).<br/><br/>The more I think about it, the more that it seems that the superheroic architecture of the setting is one of the big problems with D&amp;D 5th, especially because it is not only part of the narrative furniture but also baked into the mechanics.<br/><br/>It seems that D&amp;D has gone from a set expectation of low magic/local importance to a regular expectation of trans-high magic/global importance to start with, and that is definitely a change in flavor which a lot of people may not and don't necessarily have to enjoy.<br/><br/>It's funny, because I was just looking at a description of <b>Starfinder</b> on <i>TV Tropes</i> and realizing how much fun the setting sounded because it truly embrace to the gonzo, over the top sci-fi/fantasy hybrid nature of the setup. But it felt to be sci-fi/fantasy, not fantasy/superheroic because the stories that it wanted to tell dropped the PCs into these gonzo, <b>Star Wars</b> cantina-style environments without making the PCs stand out in contrast to them.<br/><br/>In a sense, D&amp;D has become its own parody.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_478725">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478725/#Comment_478725" name="Item_178" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-07T20:20:50+00:00" title="December  7, 2018  8:20PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            SquidLord,<br/><br/>I can't agree more. Well said, once again.<br/><br/>On the subject of "who's a hero?":<br/><br/>It's true that superhero stories have a slightly different approach to "who's a superhero" than D&amp;D/fantasy stories. In fantasy stories, it's often a question of birthright or lineage (the heroes tend to be of royal blood, ancient bloodlines, born half-human half-God - e.g. Greek myths - or similar). In superhero stories, there's usually an "origin story", which often involves some terrible traumatic incident.<br/><br/>In D&amp;D, however, there's an assumption/idea that anyone can just choose to become an adventurer, and, bam! they're level 1 and can collect XPs. <br/><br/>That's an interesting distinction!<br/><br/>D&amp;D also builds in the "zero-to-hero" story, which most superheroes don't share (but some do, like Spiderman). However, that's not so different from fantasy stories, either: Frodo and Sam go from zero-to-hero, but Legolas and Gimli are basically the same throughout (except for learning to love each other).<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_478726">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478726/#Comment_478726" name="Item_179" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-07T20:24:24+00:00" title="December  7, 2018  8:24PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" rel="nofollow">Hans_c-o</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>the system is not a tightly-designed mechanism in the way that something like Burning Wheel is.

That's an interesting point of view! <br/><br/>I wasn't particularly looking at it that way, I think, because that's a feature most traditional RPGs share.

I keep thinking "why wouldn't you do this in Dungeon World?" ("You" in that sentence being you, Matt.)<br/><br/>I'm not a huge Dungeon World fan, as I've said before, so I agree with your (implied) criticisms of the game. I can totally see, though, how someone who really enjoys the basic gameplay of Dungeon World but wants a little more mechanical detail to keep their interest and grow/develop the game as it goes along, would gravitate to D&amp;D. There's certainly a lot more to explore there, in terms of System, and to keep interest alive as the characters level up.<br/><br/>Am I guessing somewhere in the right area, here? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" rel="nofollow">Deliverator</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>What do you mean, Paul, about classes having restrictions? (You could certainly remove certain classes without breaking the game. I ran an all-Wizards game for awhile, and also a game where no spellcasting classes at all were in the game.)<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nHmm! I'm not sure which of my comments you're referring to. <br/><br/>What I was probably talking about, though, is how I find most D&amp;D classes to be parodies of themselves at this point. The Barbarian is really strong and gets really angry and hates wizards. The wizard is weak but knowledgeable. Stuff like that.<br/><br/>D&amp;D makes it really hard for you to make, say, an angry, strong, stupid wizard who runs around with a big hammer.<br/><br/>Moreover, it's not just about character creation: it's something you're buying into for a long time. This is kind of what I was hinting at earlier:\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" rel="nofollow">Deliverator</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>By the way, I'm... not sure why you think it's not possible to have a character be a baker's apprentice. Even if there's not a specific Background in the book that exactly fits your character concept, just make one up: every Background is two skills, two languages and/or tool proficiencies, some non-combat / setting ability, and some equipment. If I had a player tell me they wanted to be the child of a baker, then, sure.<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nOk, so what I was using "baker's apprentice" as a shorthand was a fantasy trope: there's the young innocent kid, who doesn't have anything going for him. He's bored, he has no experience and no skills. This is the kid whose life is changed one day when he draws a sword from the stone. It's Bilbo Baggins, it's Luke Skywalker...<br/><br/>Basically, he's poor, he's innocent, he knows nothing, he owns nothing, he lives in a little town. What will happen to him? We know he will be a hero someday; dramatic necessity tells us he's destined for great things.<br/><br/>But will he become squire to a knight? Or apprentice with a wizard? Or turn dark and become an assassin? Or join a troupe of dragonslayers? Or refuse to pick up a sword and take on hardship, sacrificing himself for the greater good? We don't know yet. We're excited to see what he will become.<br/><br/>How do we do that in D&amp;D? I have no idea. Any class I pick will give me combat powers and magical spells and all kinds of awesome weapons and gear and armour. My stats will start good and basically stay that way.<br/><br/>And then I've signed up for a certain "career path", if you will. (Sure, you can multi-class - does that still exist in 5E? - but many options or combinations are not a good idea mechanically.)<br/><br/>That little dirty kid who knows nothing? Ain't part of the D&amp;D world anymore. As SquidLord says, this is superhero fiction (except for those superheroes who DO start as clueless innocents, or those who are grizzled veterans trying to stave off their inevitable doom). <br/><br/>Likewise, I can't be that guy (the grizzled veteran at the end of his career): I can't be Luke and I can't be Obi-Wan, either. I can only be Anakin in the prequels. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" rel="nofollow">Deliverator</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>One interesting thing about the race / class combos is that, even by total RAW, human is always an optimal option. The people you played with, Paul, were just morons who didn't understand that or point it out as an option. The only thing needed for a race / class combo to be viable is that you start with a 16 in your main stat. With my rules, with the floaters, any race / class combo is doable.<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nHuman isn't impossible... but having a character with really lousy stats unsuited to their class/race combo isn't a good option at most D&amp;D tables.<br/><br/>For instance, with that particular group stats were rolled, not allocated. That means that if you have a 16, you'd better choose a race which bumps that up to 18! Those restrictions are very real - you could argue that, hey, "you can do anything you want!" but the system sure pushes you in a certain direction.<br/><br/>(If you want to tell me that rolling your stats in D&amp;D5 is illogical, I won't argue, of course! But it's part of the tradition and it's right there in the book. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> )<br/><br/>(Also: I think your house rule there is excellent, by the way, and would use it in my own game, if I ever run one. That changes thing dramatically!)<br/><br/>For another example, I didn't want my Sorcerer to be charismatic - I was hoping for the dark, grim, antisocial one. But, no, not an option. There are small restrictions like that every step of the way, in terms of rules, in terms of Colour, and in terms of where you're headed as the game progresses. Your Sorcerer is going to be really good with people, full stop.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" rel="nofollow">Deliverator</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>The new subclasses in Xanathar's Guide to Everything, by the way, do a lot to flesh out the range of possible character concepts. <br/></p></div></blockquote>\nThat's fair! But also a big commitment in terms of money and time spent. That wasn't an option for me (for example).<br/><br/>There's also always the (fairly justified) fear that such "splats" will screw something up and won't be balanced properly. That may or may not concern you, but it could concern the group you're playing with, who may push back against your desire to play some newfangled race/class that they didn't have access to when they started the game (for instance).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_478730">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478730/#Comment_478730" name="Item_181" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-07T21:01:22+00:00" title="December  7, 2018  9:01PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 7, 2018 9:07PM by Paul_T.">edited December 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" rel="nofollow">Deliverator</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>And sure, the average person isn't as adept as I am at making rule changes and using the system to its best advantage, but most of the things I'm pointing out are right there in the book.<br/><br/>[...]<br/><br/>Specifically, in the superhero stories I'm into, there is a ton of room for interpersonal drama, hamming it up, and even characters changing over time, albeit in fairly broad strokes sorts of ways. Leaning on the BIFTs the way I do\u2014well, I hadn't thought of it before, but it does a reasonably good job of producing that sort of party dynamic: they're still a team, but they might fight over things, or someone's personal weaknesses might screw over the entire group at a crucial moment, and then there will be fallout from that.<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nYou're not entirely wrong, of course, but I think you overestimate how hard or easy that is to do when you're not someone who is a) knowledgeable about the rules, and good with tinkering in general, b) has the time to look into all these options and figure out how to make them work, and c) is either running her own game, or has enough social clout to impose such modifications on a group she's joining.<br/><br/>I can see someone saying, "Hey, that just means you're not a dedicated enough gamer!" But, practically speaking, those are still major roadblocks for people. I'm a knowledgeable and experienced gamer, but I don't feel confident (nor do I have the time to) write up my own class and bring it a group I'm joining. That could take many, many sessions of playtesting and fiddling. (And then it would require a pretty involved social situation to convince the new group to allow it, in many cases.)<br/><br/>I'm glad you've worked out a way to get BIFTs to work for you, for instance, but it's clearly not something that's obvious for most D&amp;D players. Surveys show that very, very few D&amp;D groups <i>ever use Inspiration at all</i>, never mind get some good mileage out of them in the way you're describing. <br/><br/>Even the <i>Critical Role</i> folks (who are certainly committed to what they do!) have decided not to use Inspiration because they don't know what to do with it, and it's not worth the trouble to them. <br/><br/>I've been involved in four different D&amp;D5 games at this point, and watched two other online, and I have yet to see a single example of D&amp;D's rules "producing that sort of party dynamic". Another friend of mine (a very experienced and committed gamer) has just had to reboot his D&amp;D campaign because leaning on the BIFTs and Inspiration created so much disjunction in his group that they've been forced to rewrite the BIFTs and the GM's prep almost from the ground up to get things aligned again.<br/><br/>I can see how your methods and modifications produce that kind of play, with the right players, but what you're doing is practically a different game, in my opinion (and/or you have the right players who've bought into that idea in the first place, and play it to the hilt). <br/><br/>I hope I'm not coming across as too critical: I'm just trying to explain where I'm coming from. I'd love to play in your game someday, for example, to experience it first hand (because I have no doubt that you're reporting it correctly).<br/><br/>I'm still excited to learn more, as well, and to hear about Hans' "style" when he (hopefully) shares that with us! There's lots of gaming fun to be had out there. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_478731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Trent_W" title="Trent_W"><img alt="Trent_W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Trent_W">Trent_W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478731/#Comment_478731" name="Item_182" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-07T21:02:20+00:00" title="December  7, 2018  9:02PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I don't find the game *easier* to hack than other games, however.

A big part of this is because it is easier to gate content through the tiers framework, it has far more robust reward cycles, and much of the assumptions you highlighted earlier (especially in regards to the presence of spells and magic items) are pretty absent in 4E.<br/><br/>As an example, I want to run a low-fantasy game of political intrigue where combat is relatively infrequent but quite deadly. In 4E, I can literally do this out of the box with only a modest tweaking of the rules (mostly limiting what races, classes, and perhaps feats are available) and the game's PC resource suites, reward cycles, and conflict resolution systems would support my style of game just fine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_478734">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478734/#Comment_478734" name="Item_183" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-07T21:08:57+00:00" title="December  7, 2018  9:08PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting, Trent!

Old-school D&amp;D, by contrast, tends to have a bell-curve distribution for ability modifiers (so more like 9-12 is a +0, 13-17 is a +1, etc). This, coupled with the fact that actual ability scores increases are fairly rare in old-school  D&amp;D compared to modern editions, means that your abilities in general are fairly inconsequential.<br/><br/>Which still begs the obvious question: why bother having them in the first place? <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>(The only decent answer I can think of is for ability checks, but since D&amp;D has had some form of non-weapon proficiencies or skill rankings for decades now, I really don't see the point.)\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>D&amp;D always has a lot of stuff baked into it, but more recent editions constrain you a lot more by including very specific Colour in the characer options (e.g. the Draconic Sorcerer I keep bringing up <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> ) and by making character effectiveness and specific character abilities and character builds a necessary part of the game.</p></div></blockquote>\nThis is much less of an issue in my preferred iteration of D&amp;D because of a strong emphasis on re-fluffing or re-flavoring (its actually discussed in some length in the DMG2).\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>In old-school D&amp;D, sit down and watch people play... you'll hear a lot of things like "I take the beer mug and smash it on his helmet!", and that could be most of what happens at the table.

I don't like D&amp;D 5th, I don't like D&amp;D 3rd or 3.5, I don't like AD&amp;D, and I think that truly old-school very basic original D&amp;D is kind of interesting from a conceptual point of view as an inheritor of Chainmail and has an interesting implicit setting but the mechanics make my eyes bleed.<br/><br/>D&amp;D 4th is kind of interesting.<br/><br/>Having exposed myself as some kind of weirdo and perverse provocateur, let me also say that I recognize the place of D&amp;D in the overall architecture of traditional gaming and I recognize there are certain traits and tropes which are clear and rooted in the literature. While I may not enjoy them for myself, I understand why other people do.<br/><br/>Which brings us back to the traditional idea of D&amp;D play really only taking place as you would say it "during levels 1 \u2013 3 of the additions in question." I would bump up the high-end of that to 5 or 10, but essentially maintain it.<br/><br/>The difference in a significant way is that versions of D&amp;D prior to 4th strongly focused on character as process. If you didn't start as a first level character it was expected that it was an advanced option. You had experience of going through the establishment and evolution of a character from nothing and everyone had simply decided to move on past that initial qualification \u2013 but often it wasn't with serious equipment, treasure, or spell craft. The advanced character was considered competent but not extraordinary.<br/><br/>And that's important, because the "zero to hero" idea is not just about power, and you could make the argument that it has nothing to do with power, but instead is about character and player agency as regards the setting.<br/><br/>Traditionally, your experience with the character was an accumulation of "cool shit" to tap into, and every time that you did so it was implicitly assumed that it was a reminder of how that particular aspect became a part of the character. If you activate your Cool Power, implicitly you and everyone at the table is reminded of the adventure that you went on to get the XP to unlock the Cool Power. If you swing of the life-draining Hell sword, you and everyone at the table are reminded (and sometimes talk about) that awesome adventure you went on where you got the life-draining Hell sword. Thus, a lot of what gets described as "old-school play" is really about play which is deeply connected in the latter stages to experiences in the earlier stages.<br/><br/>Modern D&amp;D play seems to want to skip a lot of that, and as a result it comes up a little bit hollow with characters who all seem to be obsessed with the buttons on the character sheet and their cool powers and less so about establishing cool context with the other people at the table.<br/><br/>Interestingly, this is also a problem that superhero-focused RPGs can and have had. The debate about whether a character is being played and portrayed as something larger than the selection of cool buttons on the character sheet that get hit for some kind of delicious reward has been going on since there were superhero-focused RPGs. Always the response centers around whether or not the character has context which other players at the table can share.<br/><br/>The new D&amp;D party looks like a group of superheroes. Everyone looks different, everyone has different powers, and everyone comes to the table with an assortment of colorful buttons that are linked to false context.<br/><br/>I think this is what <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> is really getting at in a lot of his response.<br/><br/>Cool powers in D&amp;D 5th are linked, aggressively, to inherent traits of the character class, of the character race, all the things which are set very early on before anyone else is at the table. That first through 3rd level experience seen in more traditional D&amp;D doesn't happen on screen. It's assumed to have happened before the characters show up at whatever their initiating experience is. It's never really talked about how important setting up the context, the shared mental space, of gameplay for the characters to be interesting really is.<br/><br/>That's not to say that context can't be meaningful and doesn't eventually get established in modern D&amp;D play but it is saying that driving that context, creating that space, isn't helped to by modern incarnations of D&amp;D \u2013 to the point where it's perfectly reasonable to say "if I'm going to have to do all this anyway without the support of the system, why shouldn't I play a system which actually helps me do things I want to do?"<br/><br/>It is more than okay to say, "you know what? D&amp;D is not a set of tools that helps me get what I want at the table. It doesn't have to be. It's okay that it's not. And other people are using it out of brand loyalty, out of a fixation on a dream that is not actually happening, or out of a desire to want to be seen playing the Right Game \u2013 but I don't have to."<br/><br/>And they don't.<br/><br/>D&amp;D, from my perspective, has evolved away from doing one thing well to trying to do everything well and doing no one thing well, and I don't need that.<br/><br/>That's no problem for me, but it seems to be a problem for some other people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_478760">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Trent_W" title="Trent_W"><img alt="Trent_W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Trent_W">Trent_W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478760/#Comment_478760" name="Item_190" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-08T00:52:36+00:00" title="December  8, 2018 12:52AM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi <a href="/forums/profile/SquidLord">@SquidLord</a> , I'm with you here but one thing stood out for me...\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/SquidLord" rel="nofollow">SquidLord</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>And that's important, because the "zero to hero" idea is not just about power, and you could make the argument that it has nothing to do with power, but instead is about character and player agency as regards the setting.<br/><br/>Traditionally, your experience with the character was an accumulation of "cool shit" to tap into, and every time that you did so it was implicitly assumed that it was a reminder of how that particular aspect became a part of the character. <b>If you activate your Cool Power, implicitly you and everyone at the table is reminded of the adventure that you went on to get the XP to unlock the Cool Power. </b>If you swing of the life-draining Hell sword, you and everyone at the table are reminded (and sometimes talk about) that awesome adventure you went on where you got the life-draining Hell sword.

In a sense, 4th doesn't even pretend to try to say "this is the good old D&amp;D you've always been playing." It just goes gonzo from page 1 and continues blithely on.<br/><br/>(I've often thought that while it would have had nothing like the brand loyalty push or awareness, D&amp;D 4th Edition suffered the most from simply being D&amp;D. If it had been Ultra-Fantasy RPG instead of D&amp;D 4th, most of the criticisms of the game generally just fall away.)\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Trent_W" rel="nofollow">Trent_W</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Also, it seems to me that even in old-school D&amp;D spellcasting characters predominantly get their special powers the same way --- by just being a magic-user and getting XP (and perhaps using their time and wealth to research spells in between adventures). </p></div></blockquote>\nSure \u2013 but they have the advantage of everyone being onboard at the beginning with an understanding of the fact that old-school spell casters pull cool powers right out of their own butts between adventures. In fact, that's part of the appeal of having one in your party. Unfortunately, it's less cool when everybody has the same mechanical expectation as the spell caster in traditional D&amp;D gameplay.<br/><br/>That's part of the reason I really don't enjoy traditional D&amp;D gameplay. Especially as it evolved toward modern play styles, it became more and more about every single player at the table having a different set of mechanics attached to them and while I enjoy expressing my system mastery as much as any 14-year-old boy, at a certain point it's just tedious.<br/><br/>That is also what is helping drive this feeling of superhero-tropes in modern fantasy D&amp;D, the feeling that every character in the party absolutely has to be completely unique not just in narrative, or in personal attachments, or in history, but across the board mechanically. It's always been part of the D&amp;D experience, but if you're going to turn it up to 11 at least make it convenient as in D&amp;D 4th and not a right pain in the ass to manage like D&amp;D 5th.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_478818">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478818/#Comment_478818" name="Item_192" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-10T16:15:46+00:00" title="December 10, 2018  4:15PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Big picture: my goal in this thread has been (or has become) to untangle a couple of strands of people's reactions to 5E, especially Paul's.<br/><br/>As someone deeply invested in 5E, but often skeptical of RAW and frustrated by its vague stance on crucial matters, here is my take:<br/><br/>A. There are some things that people have identified as features of 5E that are genuine <b>matters of taste</b>. <br/><br/>1. Yes, by default it caters to people who enjoy having a very wide mishmosh of fantasy races in the game, and a bit of a "superhero team" feel to most parties.<br/> <br/>2. No, 1st level characters are not incompetents forced to improvise desperately in order to survive, \xe0 la OD&amp;D. <br/><br/>3. Yes, the game requires a certain amount of system mastery\u2014more on that below, in fact.<br/><br/>B. There are a number of other strands of the conversation that feel to me like either <b>misunderstandings</b>, <b>misrepresentations</b>, or conclusions that are <b>only true</b> about 5E under the <b>worst of circumstances</b>, but won't hold under medium-to-good play conditions.<br/><br/>1. With even a modicum of system mastery, it is absolutely possible to construct perfectly viable characters who fall outside of stereotypes ("wizard with a big hammer").<br/><br/>2. Even at mid-to-high levels, 5E can be quite challenging; although the risk of character death is generally low (certainly not nonexistent, even past the low levels, but low), it is not hard for PCs to end up in circumstances where they are unable to accomplish their goals and/or are forced to allow their antagonists to accomplish bad goals.<br/><br/>3. 5E has excellent game balance, and using the material from splatbooks (of which there are <i>very</i> few, relative to 1st-4th editions) won't break your game. On top of that, it does a great job of allowing total min-maxers to play side-by-side with people who only moderately optimize. (This has to do with Feats vs. Stat Improvements, and the fact that multiclassing is actually punishingly bad in most cases, and certainly never better than single-classing.) 5E even works fine with characters of different levels in the party, because of flattened math ("bounded accuracy").<br/><br/>In fact, the addition of <i>Xanathar's Guide</i> to the canon of 5E books significantly improves the game along several dimensions. Not only does it contain support for a number of long-wished-for character concepts (non-magical Ranger, peace-loving Paladin, divine Sorcerer and Warlock, and non-evil Death Cleric, for examples), but it also has much more robust support for establishing detailed character backstories. <br/><br/>4. Combat is not supposed to take a long time! The average combat is supposed to take 2-3 rounds, which should be about a half-hour of real time at most. This isn't theoretical: this timing is consistent with my own play experiences, both as player and GM.<br/><br/>C. Other things fall somewhere in the middle.<br/><br/>1. For example, while it's not the game's default, it's easy to restrict a setting to just the "normal" PC races from prior editions, and/or to excise certain character classes / subclasses.<br/><br/>2. While characters do not start out as incompetent schlubs, earning your way to 2nd or 3rd level is normally the way you earn your "name," i.e., gain your subclass. Sorcerer and Cleric are the exceptions here. Barbarian, Bard, Fighter, Monk, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, and Warlock gain their subclasses at 3rd level, while Druid and Wizard enter theirs at 2nd. (Warlocks are a bit of an exception, in that they gain their patron at 1st level, which determines many of their abilities, but their true subclass doesn't come until 3rd.)<br/><br/>Having played and GM'd from 1st level through to (or past) 3rd level a number of times, I can tell you that there is a very big difference in feel. 1st-level (and 2nd-level characters, in the vast majority of cases, as you can see) feel much, much more like "beginners" than characters who have acquired their subclasses. It happens reasonably quickly, but it feels like a real achievement.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_478823">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478823/#Comment_478823" name="Item_193" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-10T17:35:26+00:00" title="December 10, 2018  5:35PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 10, 2018 5:38PM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited December 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't mind the apologism myself, but in case you feel that your message is not being sufficiently appreciated, do remember that we all have our own favourite games, too [grin].<br/><br/>It is not a very special feature for a trad game to be very good assuming you first rip out all the bits you don't like and then do skilled game design to reconceptualize the rest to fit with your vision, followed up by a good execution of actual game mastering. This is what the good GM of the good GM myth does. My own reading recognizes an approximate 100 trad games over the history of roleplaying that are worthwhile classics by this metric. Plenty to play right there - I suggest starting with <i>Runequest</i>, I hear it's a hoot if you hack the shit out of BRP.<br/><br/>I don't find Paul's judgement of 5th edition that controversial myself. Yeah, it's got a clean mechanical execution and a very middle-of-the-road design philosophy intended to cater to all tastes. It's also totally sold on both the ethos and genre stylings of "video game fantasy", so hopefully that works for you or you like hacking; anything else you see there is because of you, not the text, aside from a few paragraphs of old school GMing advice randomly mixed in here and there to support the concept of "something for everybody". It is also nothing special, unless you specifically consider a mechanically slightly modernized 3rd edition published almost 20 years later a revolutionary development. I would have difficulty naming a situation where I couldn't pick Pathfinder instead of the 5th, myself; minor differences this way or that, sure, but nothing the good GM can't hack over if they want to.<br/><br/>This being the case doesn't have to be a problem, surely? Or does Paul need to be convinced to give the game another go? I feel like that's what this thread has been about for a while now - telling Paul why he should give 5th edition another shot in a world full of interesting gaming projects. Don't pass on your happiness, Paul! This could be your time of visitation!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_478829">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478829/#Comment_478829" name="Item_194" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-10T20:47:11+00:00" title="December 10, 2018  8:47PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, personally, it doesn't matter to me if someone doesn't like 5E for its creative aesthetics or whatever, but it does bother me when people misunderstand it.<br/><br/>I couldn't disagree more regarding Pathfinder (or, really, most trad games). That thing's a fucking mess, and there is in fact, not a way to easily hack it to make it work.<br/><br/>This is actually important: the basic mathematical structure of PF is just... horrible. Endless stacking fiddly bonuses, different tiers of character class effectiveness (which leads to practically needing a degree in the mechanics to make a good character), unintuitive action economy, magic item dependence... the list goes on.<br/><br/>5E really, genuinely is better than that, as a core game. The stuff I've done is change the XP rules and some play procedures. To fix PF, you'd have to rewrite the mechanics from the ground up, which would give you... 5E. <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_478834">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478834/#Comment_478834" name="Item_195" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-10T21:27:41+00:00" title="December 10, 2018  9:27PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not familiar enough with Pathfinder to say how it compares to 5e... I would probably choose 5e on the basis of having slightly simpler rules, but otherwise, from the outside, it's hard to see any substantial differences in playstyle (although I trust Matt/Deliverator on questions of implementation).<br/><br/>I should clarify, perhaps, that I've come across as really negative here recently, due to most of my posts be responses to people asking about what I see as negatives in D&amp;D5. There's a lot about the game that's not to my tastes, in terms of fictional material, implied playstyle (as this thread shows, from the opening post), a lack of focus in design (e.g. BIFTs which don't interact with adventure modules), and just the weight of rules in places that don't particularly interest me.<br/><br/>(For instance, I totally trust Deliverator when he says he runs combats in 30 mins or less, but I don't think the rest of us have his Intelligence or carefully-chosen gamer Feats. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> In two games I joined, a combat took about 30 mins per round of combat, quite reliably, and <i>Critical Role's</i> stats show that the average combat is about an hour long - but they're incredibly fast at referencing rules and potentially get off-screen help.)<br/><br/>I nevertheless see a lot of good things in D&amp;D5, and appreciate the very well-managed design, which seems to have achieved all of their design goals. If I felt it was worth it to learn a lot of rules, loved D&amp;D-video-game fantasy imagery and tropes, and bought into the whole "fantasy superheroes" approach, I'd play this game with zero hesitation. <br/><br/>Watching some <i>Critical Role</i> with the "superhero" mindset so well explained in the last page or so of this thread gives me some insight into how to make the game work, actually. You NEED those borderline-campy four-colour villains and monsters and heroes, rather than classic fantasy storylines or anything even vaguely medieval/historical/realistic, and if you commit to that, you get really dramatic and cool action/adventure.<br/><br/>The game definitely seems to deliver well on those fronts (with the problems outlined in the OP still outstanding, however - basically, embrace Participationism or you're somewhat on your own).<br/><br/>So, yeah, it works.<br/><br/>(Although, thinking about it a little further, I don't consider XP rules and BIFTs/Inspiration playable "out of the box"; I would need to hack that, at least, to make the game workable, as Deliverator has, as has 2097, and so on.)<br/><br/>Thinking about this further led to me rediscover this old idea I had about running D&amp;D modules as a weird sort of explicit-Participationist-sandbox-hybrid, starting about here, which I still think might be an interesting inversion of the way the game is supposed to go:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/448071/#Comment_448071" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/448071/#Comment_448071</a><br/><br/>I'm actually really excited to see <a href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o%27s">@Hans_c-o's</a> eventual "House D&amp;D" thread, which I really hope is forthcoming!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_478837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478837/#Comment_478837" name="Item_196" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-10T21:45:02+00:00" title="December 10, 2018  9:45PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            5e is not "slightly simpler" than PF.

I'm having quite a bit of lonely fun right now with 5e, which I'm starting to realize is a necessary part of what it will take for ME to enjoy running it. Part of my mistake before is that I didn't prep enough (not that 5e needs ungodly amounts of prep, but if I am going to run a non-OSR trad game I think the only way to successfully do that (for ME) is to prep a lot). <br/><br/>Eero, you might say, "but that's just normal successful trad play." Okay, but I haven't had that experience yet!<br/><br/>Also, Paul, I find my combats were more or less in accord with Matt, when it comes to time. I ran for 6-7 PCs, and most fights took 30-45 minutes unless they were big boss fights. I've sort of taken it as known and obvious that 5e fights are about this fast; they were for me.<br/><br/>And yeah, you can squint and say 5e and PF are basically the same, but that's nonsense.

they're technically an optional rule*. You can always take a stat boost instead, a major way that people not interested in looking through a list of Feats in order to min-max are accommodated. (There's a solid argument that taking the stat boost is always, mathematically, the better option, in most cases.) But even if you take nothing but Feats, and choose Variant Human to get an extra Feat at 1st level, you'll still only have 3 Feats when you reach 8th level.<br/><br/>And with them being so rare, the design goal was to make them more powerful and special. Which they (mostly) did a nice job with. However, because of that, if you do get 2-3 Feats which synergize, you can become incredibly powerful, at least at doing one specific thing. So long lists of Feats are a bad idea because they make it more likely to create monstrous, one-trick-pony type characters.<br/><br/>*Multiclassing is also optional in 5E, and for good reason, though of course it's not explained as well as it should be: it's very easy to nerf yourself into oblivion if you multiclass unwisely.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_478902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Trent_W" title="Trent_W"><img alt="Trent_W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Trent_W">Trent_W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478902/#Comment_478902" name="Item_207" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-13T14:03:53+00:00" title="December 13, 2018  2:03PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/yukamichi" rel="nofollow">yukamichi</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>If a menagerie of race and class options can be casually justified as an endemic part of the D&amp;D experience, I don't see why a laundry list of Feats would be <i>that</i> controversial.</p></div></blockquote>\nYou gotta love how a list of 360+ spells is good but a list of 60 feats is bad.<br/><br/>D&amp;D Logic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_478903">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478903/#Comment_478903" name="Item_208" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-13T14:29:32+00:00" title="December 13, 2018  2:29PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 13, 2018 2:40PM by DeReel.">edited December 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't agree too much.

Some moves, like some feats, are so <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tqH-Un9SFU" rel="nofollow">close to the engine</a> you can't just customize them for colour.

In that game, they are clearly minor enhancements or improvements to your class features, spells, or powers.   In other d20 games they run the gamut from giving you more powers to modifying your powers to boosting stats or skills to mostly giving some extra Colour (I'm looking at you, Linguist) for fictional positioning. <br/><br/>Still, one can't help but ponder that the primary means 5E gives to customize non-casters is seen as a negative because it "breaks the game" alongside virtually no loss in customization for casters because spells, spells, and more spells (which definitely totally and are completely less potent than feats and don't break the game at all, /sarcasm).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_478920">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478920/#Comment_478920" name="Item_211" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-13T18:22:47+00:00" title="December 13, 2018  6:22PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, you meant <span style="text-decoration: underline;">that</span> kind of 360 spells.

I actually find the way high-level casters work to be one of the major breakthroughs of 5E within the design space of D&amp;D as a whole. The spell progression's brilliance is the sort of thing that really wasn't obvious on first examination: it looked, on paper, quite a bit like 3.X / PF. But under the hood, the differences are profound.<br/><br/>Basically, beyond 5th level of spells, spellslots are <i>extremely</i> limited. Unless you are truly not making resting an issue <i>at all</i> and are always sending your PCs into every fight fully-rested, this limitation works well strategically and for a matter of game balance. Once the wizard has cast the three "big" spells, suddenly, being a Fighter with four attacks, every round forever, doesn't seem so bad.<br/><br/>Start mixing in abilities that refresh on a short rest, which high-level spells never do, and actually give your players some short rests, and the results are even more dramatic. It's not that high-level casters are "nerfed": far from it. They can do some amazing things with those 6th-9th level spells. But they can't do it all day long, and that matters in 5E.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_478949">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478949/#Comment_478949" name="Item_215" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-14T04:03:17+00:00" title="December 14, 2018  4:03AM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 14, 2018 2:37PM by JDCorley.">edited December 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's how it looks on the surface, but casting "the rogue/fighter/other PC should have stayed home and not got in my way" utility spells from your own spell slots is a mug's game, and 5e makes it so that any spellcaster can make scrolls for just a component cost (it used to be that only wizards got the scribe scroll feat for free). 5e is at least as bad as 3e in full-caster-supremacy, but at least hides it a little bit better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_478950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Trent_W" title="Trent_W"><img alt="Trent_W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Trent_W">Trent_W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478950/#Comment_478950" name="Item_216" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-14T04:06:33+00:00" title="December 14, 2018  4:06AM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 14, 2018 4:09AM by Trent_W.">edited December 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, the game is reasonably well-balanced if your only metric is "hit point ablation" and you always have 6 to 8 encounters a day.<br/><br/>Change either of those assumptions*, of course, and the game isn't well-balanced. Like, at all. It isn't even remotely balanced outside of combat, for example. Spellcasters overwhelmingly dominate there, even at low levels.<br/><br/>Of course, as <a href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">@Hans_c-o</a> alluded to, this is somewhat less of an issue in 5E than 3E/PF because 80% of all playable characters in the game are spellcasters, anyway. The Champion and Thief are mostly there for legacy reasons. It truly is The Spellcaster Edition.<br/><br/>(*These assumptions, combined with the fact that the only pre-Unearthed Arcana way of gaining XP in the game is by killing things, leads me strongly to believe the default mode of play is rather combat-intensive dungeoncrawls. This is perhaps why 5E doesn't strike me as particularly well-balanced: I am not a fan of dungeoncrawls and rarely use them in my home games, so these assumptions won't bear out in our games.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_478953">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478953/#Comment_478953" name="Item_217" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-14T08:28:38+00:00" title="December 14, 2018  8:28AM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 14, 2018 11:07PM by Hans_c-o.">edited December 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree, Trent, that 5e is best used as a combat intensive game with 6-8 encounters per day. That should be obvious! One Third of the core rules is just monsters to fight. It's how I plan to run 5e when I run it again.<br/><br/>Although now I'll have to pay close attention to the spell scroll rules that Jason brought up. May have to houserule their excision, which fits pretty well with my setting-in-development anyway. (edit: looked them up, both in DMG and Xanathar's. Not seeing the same problem that Jason is. It still takes a lot of time to make a scroll of any value, so unless you give the players loads of downtime, it shouldn't be an issue. And per the DMG rules, the PC has to use up the relevant spell slot *every day* while they are working on the spell scroll. So you lose a slot every day and at the end of a month you have a one-time extra spell? That doesn't seem overly powered to me).<br/><br/>I quite like that 5e is the Spellcaster edition. It solves a lot of problems pretty neatly.  And I'm not even a big fan of spellcasting classes. I always want to play a Barbarian or Battlemaster Fighter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_478968">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478968/#Comment_478968" name="Item_218" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-15T02:50:15+00:00" title="December 15, 2018  2:50AM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've discussed extensively the fact that the game doesn't function well when you remove the assumption of 6-8 encounters before a long rest.

(This is where I differ from Sandra, and <i>possibly</i> Adam [?].)</p></div></blockquote><p>To be clear I\u2019ve done two things to make this a great part of the game.</p><ol><li><p>I nerfed the spells that give endless supplies of these things, such as goodberry and the \u201clight\u201d cantrip. I added mandatory material components to them.</p></li><li><p>I made the tracking into a fun puzzle sub game that the players have come to enjoy as a constant source of prioritizing and making interesting choices. They <em>really</em> mourned their horse, mostly because they lost so many item slots. Same when a hench dies, they mourn the loss of her item slots much more than the additional firepower she brought. Item slots are one of their most precious resources. It\u2019s also a pretty straight-forward subgame. If you pick up something and you don\u2019t have slots, you erase something else. Just as in real life, if you want put something in your backpack and it\u2019s full, you toss something out. The visual representation of putting things in this or that compartment or strapping it on etc makes it fun and maps well to their model of \u201crealism\u201d or w/e. We were talking about this sub-game just the other day, after using the same version (after a <em>lot</em> of false starts with crappy iterations of the inventory sheets with chains and shapes and such, now it\u2019s all circles and all easy) since July 2018 and how, even though it\u2019s something they spend a lot of time on, is something they really enjoy.</p></li></ol><p>They have definitely died from lack of rope, lack of bedroll, lack of food, lack of water etc at various points in time during our four-and-a-half years as a group. When Razira (an NPC hench) died they were like \u201cOH SHIT WHO IS GONNA CARRY THE ROPE?!?!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m happy because that\u2019s part of the sort of logistics game of OSR that I kinda envied when I was on the outside looking in, and it took a while to get there but wow did we get there.\u2665</p><p>All the hacking and changing we do, or I do rather, usually fall into one of these categories:</p><ul><li>adding things that put the DM-part of the game under more strict algorithms. Who do the monsters attack? When do monsters appear? Adding in the missing \u201chalf\u201d of most 90s-style RPGs (where the players had plenty of rules but the DM half of it was just like \u201ceh fudge around a bit so it looks real\u201d). This includes \u201chow many potions of healing are for sale in this town\u201d rules from ACKS and similar.</li><li>making tools for things that were cumbersome in the orig (tracking inventory pound-by-pound including backpack capability). The \u201cpounds, minutes and seconds\u201d nature of 5e, as much as I\u2019ve reverted it back to item slots and exploration \u201cturns\u201d, I\u2019ll defend thusly: it makes it way more universal and easier to convert material from other games and editions. I can drop in a GURPS dungeon or a B/X dungeon or w/e, it\u2019s great!!</li><li>clarifying things that were unclear</li><li>nerfing things that provided infinite resources at lower levels. at higher levels, or with fantastical items, they can have it. that\u2019s what makes magic so magical, you\u2019ve struggled to keep your head above water and now you can just use The Bread That Satisfies All Hunger\u2122</li><li>making theatre-of-the-mind (which always <em>worked</em>, it just\u2026 um\u2026) into a challenging and concrete <em>game</em>. With the strict design philosophy of staying away from representation and map-becoming-territory (\u2018a dungeon for ants\u2019) in favor of keeping it \u201cbig\u201d, a first person style game, taking cues from text games rather than top-down games.</li></ul><p>\u201cHow do these rooms connect?\u201d I leave my chair and go up and point. Keeping it BIG.</p><p>My love for 5e as we play it has remained constant since summer of 2014 when the Starter Set came out. It\u2019s dynamite, we\u2019ve stumbled on the perfect. However, our play has gradually diverged from the RAW and the more changes we make the less I can honestly defend the RAW.</p><p>5e is like Emacs (a computer app from the seventies that I started using in, uh, I think 1999?). I love Emacs, always have. And my Emacs has slowly mutated and evolved as I keep scripting it and changing it. And my love for it is constant. But when I sit down to a fresh install without having my conf file at the ready I\u2019m like \u201cWTF?? Emacs sucks!!!!!\u201d</p><p>Same with 5e. Us playing the Starter Set when it came out was such an amazing experience and I loved it as it was in every way. So much better than anything I had played before (including D&amp;D 4e, Labyrinth Lord, Fate and Apocalypse World). If I were to sit down with vanilla 5e <em>now</em> I\u2019d be like\u2026 \u201cwtf?\u201d</p><p>I do really enjoy it on the player side. I can make a character pretty much instantly w/o looking in books (as long as that character is a level one champion). It\u2019s just that I\u2019d have a hard time trusting the DM. Knowing that even Mearls and Crawford do things that in my game, with the rules I\u2019ve set up for my own DMing in place, would be considered game-breaking cheating. (If you scale the encounters on the fly to match the party, you are taking their lives in your own hands. And then it becomes your fault if they die. I don\u2019t want that. No offense to groups that groove on that style.)</p><p>Listen, my review of 5e can be summarized in three sentences:</p><ol><li>It\u2019s an ultra-flexible ball of mud, created to be all-things-to-all-people.</li><li>That sucks because it\u2019s really difficult to find a group that you can <strong>trust</strong> to play it how <em>you</em> want the game to be.</li><li>That\u2019s great because it\u2019s really easy to find material, both 1st party and 3rd party and from other games, that you can put to <strong>awesome</strong> use.</li></ol><p>5e is open source. It\u2019s <em>very</em> compatible with 0e, B/X/RC, 1e, 2e, 3e/PF1, OSR, and 5e material. I summarized WotC\u2019s own conversion formulas in a few sentences and glued them to the inside of the screen. It has an awesome array of character classes and options compared to OSR games. (In LotFP: \u201cI guess I\u2019ll roll up a specialist. Again.\u201d) <strong>Yes</strong>, it\u2019s flawed, thehere is some bathwater to throw out but there are <em>plenty</em> of babies swimming around in that tub.</p><p><small>(Uh, why do I only go on S-G when I\u2019m completly manic &amp; incomprehensible\u2026)</small></p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_481309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481309/#Comment_481309" name="Item_220" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-03-26T09:14:17+00:00" title="March 26, 2019  9:14AM">March 26</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I start thinking of Tolkien, or Game of Thrones, or other bits of media which I find enjoyable and exciting.</p></div></blockquote>\nI grew up on Chris Claremont's post-modern totally mindblowing take on fantasy.

That makes it a magical game and my very favorite game.</p></li></ol><p>PS.<br/>I am in tears of joy for seeing my viewpoint so well remembered, represented &amp; understood.

I wasn't disagreeing with your diamond analogy necessarily but with the notion that D&amp;D 4E and AW are "polar opposites". I have found that to not be the case, especially when I'm running those games.<br/><br/>As to the Slayer's stances vs the Weaponmaster's at-will powers, to me its not inspired its just sleight of hand. There's no fundamental difference between them either mechanically (with the notable exception of opportunity attack and charge shenanigans) nor in what actually happens in the fiction. Its just a way of rearranging the game's presentation to be more palatable to grognards (a lot of 5E's design is this way too, trying to deliberately "hide" its basis in 4E mechanics to be more appealing to the frothing masses).<br/><br/>- Trent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_481348">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481348/#Comment_481348" name="Item_229" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-03-26T14:36:37+00:00" title="March 26, 2019  2:36PM">March 26</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you for clarifying!<br/>Yeah, I totally misunderstood you in that case, I did think you meant the diamond analogy.<br/>OK, I'm not gonna argue strongly that 4e and AW are opposites.
