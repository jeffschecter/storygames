I was GMing, and we had four other players. The PCs were Sgt. "Senator" (3 FA /7 NFA), Cpl. Ruth (8/2), and Troopers McCoy (6/4) and Figaro (5/5).  In addition the Sgt. had six other NPC troopers in his squad- at least when they started. <br/><br/>The PCs were members of the 3rd Squad, 2nd Platoon, I Company ("Big Iron"), 1st Battalion.  Their platoon leader was Lt. Hardigan, giving rise to the highly questionable platoon name of "The Hardy Boys," thanks to Senator.<br/><br/>Lt. Hardigan called the platoon together aboard the <em>Sarajevo</em> to give them their mission briefing- a simple slash and burn operation with the rest of the company on planet "Bosch".  Bosch was a heavily forested world near a bright star, resulting in foliage that was orange and gold rather than green. The strange and beautiful plants were to be dutifully blasted and burned by the platoon, followed immediately by heavy application of "Salt"- a slurry of lethal toxins and radioactive materials housed in a self-contained mortar shell, to be dispersed over the cleared areas.  Once Big Iron was done with Bosch, nothing would ever grow there again.<br/><br/>The squad made their drop, losing Tr. Nguyen to crippling injuries due to a harness malfunction.  Nevertheless the squad took their position in the fire line and set to blasting the woods.  A few hours into the operation the squad made contact with aliens-  larger than man-sized lizards, running quickly across the broken trees, flaring out spiny frills around their heads and snapping their jaws (aliens won dominance, setting range to Close). The troopers engaged and killed the two creatures, suffering a minor thrashing.  Ruth and Figaro were more damaged by their own careless use of grenades than the aliens themselves.<br/><br/>Senator reported their encounter to the Lt., who promptly rewarded them by sending them into the jungle to find out where the aliens came from.  They grudgingly followed orders, as the rest of the company sat down for a chow break.  Figaro found a trail (NFA) which they followed deep into the woods.  They were nearly ambushed during an argument between the non-coms, as a much larger contingent of the aliens fell on them (aliens setting range to Close).  Most of them changed range, with Ruth using his e-cannon to bring down some trees and hold the aliens at a distance.  McCoy failed and got stuck on the wrong side of the tree, reaching for his grenades.  <br/><br/>The aliens revealed their special power- a spitting attack that covered the troopers in a thick goo, hampering sight and mobility (Impair).  Senator tried to keep the men organized and failed, turning the fight into a free-for-all.  In the end, 39 aliens lay dead, and all the troopers were still breathing, roughed up but mostly unharmed.<br/><br/>Soon after the trail led them to discover some Aztec-like ruins beneath the tree canopy, left behind by some other ancient alien race.  It was at the entrance that they encountered the next set of lizards, and this group included a new breed- six legs, larger than an APC, covered in sharp spines.  Senator used his Strength - "Tactical Luck" - right at the start, describing how even back in training he always found himself in the best positions, just by chance.  In this case it amounted to an ambush, and he and his men slaughtered the seven large aliens.<br/><br/>Reporting in, they were instructed to push ahead without reinforcements and get further intelligence.  After a lot of boot-dragging and a short chow break, they stumbled into the aliens nest- a stadium-sized canyon between the ancient walls, housing a number of gargantuan dinosaurs and a host of the spitters (at Far range). <br/><br/>Half the squad attempted to improvise an area weapon out of Salt mortars, to little effect, while McCoy sniped the aliens from afar.  The largest aliens began spitting something like cannon-shot at the troopers, blasting the rock walls around them.  Trooper Ratchett was killed by a falling pillar while the others took cover and opened fire.  In the end they closed the distance and Ruth brought down a few of the largest creatures, while Figaro finished off the last of them.  Inspecting the area, they discovered eggs and flamed them, and then called in for pickup.  Total Kills on Bosch: 68.<br/><br/>Back aboard the <em>Sarajevo</em>, Senator easily wheedled his way into a promotion to Lieutenant and was given his own command of 3rd platoon.  Much to the irritation of his squad, he arranged to have them transferred as well.  Ruth and Figaro both leveled up, medals were dispensed (by vending machine) and they all packed their kits for transfer to the <em>Bucharest</em> and their next mission...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165973/#Comment_165973" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-28T14:19:37+00:00" title="August 28, 2008  2:19PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Like you need another 3:16 thread, right?"<br/><br/>I neeeeds it, precious!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_165983">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165983/#Comment_165983" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-28T15:33:04+00:00" title="August 28, 2008  3:33PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That is what I like to hear, trooper.<br/><br/>(Also: Vending machine!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165988/#Comment_165988" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-28T15:44:20+00:00" title="August 28, 2008  3:44PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the Vending Machine angle.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I think I like the idea of "huge pomp and ceremony mandatory fall out in full dress to witness presentation; this is absolutely the most important thing in your life trooper, you live for this, and don't you forget it; we're fighting for Mom, Baseball, and Apple Pie."  even more.<br/>\n<br/>\nCuz there's nothing more annoying then a pep rally.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166014">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166014/#Comment_166014" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-28T18:05:30+00:00" title="August 28, 2008  6:05PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh yes there is.<br><br>Awards Ceremonies.<br><br>Better in the summer sun, with bayonets affixed..

Sergeant Snelling is neither loquacious or deeply stupid; this tends to curb the effect of the same qualities made manifest in our dear Lieutenant.  I still bridle a bit at the willful ignorance of my fellow Troopers - when I had the temerity to ask the Captain about the danger of pyroclastic flows on the volcanic wonderland onto which we were about to drop, I was hooted down.  Planet-side, I muddled through as the sub rosa brains of the operation, feeding Snelling (and, by extension, Lieutenant Fabulous) signals intelligence, painting targets from range, and so forth, while the more slack-jawed animals among us (Corporal Ruth, principally, and the astonishingly backward Italian Trooper whose name I never parsed) waded into a sea of gore.  Our enemy were some species of canine-like monsters, heavily augmented by hybridized technology.  We killed them.  I killed 13 myself, and I wasn't even trying.  Ruth earned a medal and, through concerted effort, we managed to get the Lieutenant demoted after he broke down and wept through our final engagement against the lava tanks.  I think slapping him down did wonders for morale - we all feel like a big, hateful family now, and the squad is well and truly integrated.

Snelling (3/7) and Troopers "Shakespeare" Nagy (5/5) and Bragg (5/5).   These guys were all veterans of 3rd Platoon ("Dennison's Dragoons") who were non-plussed to meet all the transfers from 2nd Platoon.  This included Lt. "Senator" Brown, their new Platoon Leader, who got little of their respect from the start.<br/><br/>The company commander, after making it clear to the new Lt. that he had zero confidence in his abilities, gave his mission briefing.  They were to join several other companies conducting a "hot drop" onto "Holbein", a volcanic world peopled with humanoids using crude mid-level technology.  The aliens, large canine-like creatures, would be putting up a fight, and the mission was to hit the ground shooting and clear a landing zone for the rest of the assault.<br/><br/>After a number of half-baked attempts to make their armor more lava-proof and to find out more information about the aliens, the squad made ready to drop.  The squad leader successful jammed the Lieutenant's pod, ensuring that he would launch last and arrive after the fighting had started.  Cpl. Ruth simply panicked, blowing his pod too early and arriving late as well, after drifting down through the flack on his chute. <br/><br/>On the ground, the squad engaged the enemy, who fought back with slugthrowers and rockets.  McCoy calmly sniped from afar, while Shakespeare helped the unit by painting their target zone with a laser (NFA roll to give group FA bonus).  As ranges closed, the dog-men observed the errupting volcanoes and, with religious zeal, pumped stimulants into their bloodstream to become berzerkers (special ability: Boost AA).  Trp. Figaro ran to engage them with grenades, nearly failing, but used his own combat drugs to improve the force of his throw, killing several enemies.<br/><br/>After the fighting, the company commander ordered Lt. Brown to send most of the platoon to his position as reinforcements, while the rest (the PCs) moved to capture a fortress.  As it turned out, the fortress itself was mobile, walking on giant legs to accomodate the shifting crust of the planet.<br/><br/>As soon as threat tokens hit the table, Tpr. Bragg used a Strength- remembering how in his childhood he had a knack for finding weaknesses in his brother's model constructions, he fired his energy rifle at a critical joint of one leg, bringing the whole battle platform down.  The troopers swarmed on board, immediately initiating a follow-up conflict as they murdered all the staff and crew of the facility.  It ends with Bragg, still hot from his successes, shooting the alien potentate in his throne room while the others considered what to do with him.<br/><br/>The troopers took some time to explore and relax after the fight- Figaro began experimenting with the alien drugs while Shakespeare figured out how to drive the fortress.  Shortly the Lt. got orders from the captain that they should expect an assault, and that they were to hold the fortress until reinforcements arrived.<br/><br/>When the attack began, Shakespeare used the mounted alien weapons and the others opened fire with their guns.  The aliens attacked with rockets and long range sprays of molten lava, which managed to damage a few troopers.  Greg, playing Figaro, decided it was time to force a weakness on "Senator" Brown, which resulted in the Lt. "snapping like a twig" under the pressure.  Throughout the fighting he hid in the engine room and begged the Captain for reinforcements.<br/><br/>In the end there was a roll-off for last kill, which Tpr. McCoy won, earning him a Crimson Sword.  After rotating back to the <em>Bucharest</em>, Sgt. Snelling gave his official report and recommended the Lt. for demotion, and won.

Aside from it being difficult to manage that many folks in combat (everyone talking at once, hard to sort out high rolls, etc.), it is highly unlikely that either side will ever win an ambush in Dominance.  In four conflicts, there were two occasions where one trooper failure held them back from a total win.  Of course, the rules allow for folks to simply not roll for dominance, which might narrow down the pool a bit.<br/><br/>- I think that I underutilized the ability to change range on the troopers with successful AA - If I had remembered that, I might have given the PCs more of a challenge.  My take on the range changing rules (p.18) made me think I needed to beat all the PCs, but that's not the case- you can move the ones you do beat on the rolls, possibly driving them right out of the conflict.  Then you can mop up the few remaining troopers!<br/><br/>- Originally, the fortress clearing scene involved a bunch of non-combatants- alien minions, servants, concubines, etc.  The PCs were going to kill them anyway, but wanted credit for it on their kill counters, so I put down threat tokens and made it a fight.  This leads me to postulate that "Kills" should only counted for beings that represent a threat; putting a grenade down a bunny hole doesn't get you 50 kills, unless it's a big grenade and the bunnies have vicious, pointy fangs.<br/><br/>- There were a number of internal conflicts among the PCs, mostly dealing with rank and hierarchy, as you might expect.  I wasn't sure how to deal with this mechanically, and hadn't explained "E" damage to the players yet.  In retrospect, there were a number of times when the Lt. should have been able to engage a willful trooper in a shouting match, rolling for dominance and trying to emotionally exhaust them into following orders.  I hadn't seen it before, but it's right there on p. 46 - "At the end of the non-fighting conflict all exhaustion damage is removed and the winner can impose an order on the loser.  This will not remove rebellious thoughts or change how they feel though."<br/><br/>Live and learn, and move on to the next planet, right?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_167221">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kaptainkobold" title="kaptainkobold"><img alt="kaptainkobold" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kaptainkobold">kaptainkobold</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167221/#Comment_167221" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-05T08:07:04+00:00" title="September  5, 2008  8:07AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "I hadn't seen it before, but it's right there on p. 46 - "At the end of the non-fighting conflict all exhaustion damage is removed and the winner can impose an order on the loser."<br/><br/>I missed that as well; I shall have to give that section a re-read.<br/><br/>As an aside; does E-damage add to real damage, or sit alongside it.

This shorter roster made it possible for us to run two planets.  The PCs for this session were Corporal Ruth (8/4 FA/NFA) and Troopers "Shakespeare" Nagy (5/6) and Figaro (6/5).<br/><br/><strong>Degas After Action Report</strong><br/>We opened with the troopers of 1st Squad on the ground, moving to relieve 2nd Squad at a portable bunker.  Degas was a world with a dense, high-pressure atmosphere, with the sun dimly shining through the thick gasses to paint the landscape in pink and purple tones.  The squad was arriving late to the party and had already taken losses to an accident with an APC, depriving them of their sergeant. <br/><br/>Right off Shakespeare decided to try to browbeat the Corporal into giving up his authority and his shiny E-cannon.  He started laying into him over the comm, berating Ruth's intelligence and fitness to command.  He won Dominance, setting range at Far just in case Ruth responded with violence.  The first round went to Shakespeare and Ruth took some E damage.  Not wishing to have to kill his trooper or risk losing "Jeanette" (his e-cannon), Ruth instead used one of his surplus of Strengths.  Flashing back to his days in basic, he recalled how he'd been bullied by another trainee, and how he'd learned to be "Stubborn" as a mule, not budging under verbal abuse.  He ended the conflict by staring down Shakespeare and then ordering the men to move out.<br/><br/>Figaro was the first to encounter the planet's primary life-form, a floating mass with a tail of tendrils drifting below it, something like a jellyfish.  These "cows" were alive but not sentient or dangerous, and registered no kills when shot down.<br/><br/>The squad shortly found the bunker, and 2nd squad happily relinquished the position.  When Ruth asked their Sergeant about what to expect, he laughed and told them "you'll find out."  Inspecting the area, they recognized that the bunker, a deployable armored position, was battered, filthy and nearly useless to them.  The area around it was piled high in carcasses from the cows that 2nd Squad had brought down.<br/><br/>Almost immediately the group was attacked by a group of leathery shark-like predators "swimming" through the air and invading the wide-open bunker.  The aliens (6 threat) won Dominance and set the range to Close.  Figaro went to work with his vibroblade and the others started dropping grenades out the windows to deter other aliens from coming in.  The creatures attacked them with powerful bites, but the true danger was discovered when Figaro ruptured one of their internal gas sacs, causing an immense explosive reaction.<br/><br/>The squad tried to move away, only to be hounded by the enemy and unable to regroup.  More explosions followed, Figaro desperately clinging to his blade inside the bunker.  Eventually they killed the last of the enemy, but as Figaro would have died from the final explosion, he used his Weakness.  Recalling his extensive knowledge of septic systems, he dove into the bunker's overflowing waste reclamation tank to avoid the final blast, earning himself the nickname "Shitbird" in the process.<br/><br/>While the squad slowly recovered from the attack (most of them were almost dead by the end, and they'd lost some NPCs) Ruth called 2nd Squad and berated them for the surprise, convincing their sergeant to at least send a repair crew to fix the bunker (earning them some additional armor while in that position).  This prepared them for the second attack, which came within hours.<br/><br/>The aliens ambushed the squad by approaching low to the ground.  They broke the newly patched armor of the bunker and began slipping in to attack when Figaro used a Strength.  Remembering the "Shark Week" holovids he'd watched and thinking about the alien behavior, he began pitching grenades for them to catch instinctively in their maws.  The chain reaction of explosions filled the air with meat and ended the encounter.<br/><br/>After a day of debating about whether the sharks were edible, the squad fought their last aliens.  Shakespeare spotted them at range (set to Far) and decided to use a his "Proactive" Strength- he recalled the time he joined the EF and how his abusive father would have beaten him for it, had he not planned ahead and had a couple of massive recruiters there to back his play.  The strength helped him now as he preempted the Corporal and called in their evacuation while shooting the last aliens on the planet.<br/><br/>Back aboard the <em>Bucharest</em> the Corporal was passed over for promotion but leveled up with Figaro.  Shakespeare was awarded the Crimson Sword and shortly began putting together an "Article 85" to get Ruth demoted, eventually.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_169825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169825/#Comment_169825" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-18T08:04:10+00:00" title="September 18, 2008  8:04AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 18, 2008 8:05AM by Steve_Segedy.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<strong>Klimt After Action Report</strong><br/><br/>Although the troopers were told they'd have a few weeks to recover from Degas, they were soon marshaled to order by their new temporary commander, Sergeant Fernandez.  Along with 2nd Squad they reported to the <em>Algiers</em>, a scout-class cruiser.  The cruiser left the fleet and jumped to another system, after which the squads were informed that they were now on a classified mission.<br/><br/>Fernandez gave the troopers an overview of the mission- planet Klimt had been previously destroyed by the EF, leaving only an asteroid belt and a research station behind.  The station, under the command of Captain Oxbridge, had recently stopped responding to communications.  1st and 2nd squad were here to find out why.  Their primary objective was to escort a pair of science officers on board to retrieve intelligence data from the station network.  A secondary objective was find out what happened and retrieve any survivors for debriefing.<br/><br/>After completing a zero-G entry into a cargo bay, 1st Squad searched for a computer terminal for Lt. Koperczek, the sciencist.  The station was running on emergency power and its corridors were dark.  Shakespeare saw something move in the shadows, and they opened fire with no clear targets, but registered kills nonetheless.  They saw forms moving in the darkness and were attacked as something bone-chilling passed through them (E damage).  Eventually Ruth breached the hull with his e-cannon, chasing off the enemy but destroying the computers.  <br/><br/>Moving further into the station, arguing about "ghosts", they were attacked again in an interior corridor.  Figaro watched as his own shadow moved independently, reaching for Ruth.  Ruth was forced to use a Weakness by the aliens (Induce Weakness), having a flashback to his youth as a punching bag for the schoolyard bullies, and how he learned to become a "Loner" to survive.  Remembering this fear, he slipped away, closing an airlock and watching his men get attacked through the window.<br/><br/>The troopers won the fight, again doing substantial damage to the station around them with rockets.  After being rejoined by Ruth (who had no explanation), they moved to the station core, a long multi-level chamber with a command deck at the top.  The aliens, gathered around the well-lighted entrance to that deck, were spotted by the troopers and ambushed.  Ruth used a Strength, going "Berserk" with his e-cannon and blasting ghosts by the dozens.<br/><br/>At Koperczek's insistence, the troopers opened the command deck to find a few survivors, huddled in a sealed, well-lighted room.  Captain Oxbridge (the final Threat token) began ranting about how they'd "let them in" by opening the door, and produced a TPK grenade.  Shakespeare shot him through the head, rupturing the containment and killing the survivors, but he wasn't fast enough to keep the grenade from being activated.  The squad fled as the grenade incinerated the upper decks and began a chain-reaction that destroyed the station.<br/><br/>On board the <em>Algiers</em>, Ruth and Figaro leveled again and Ruth put in and was rewarded a promotion to Sergeant, preventing Shakespeare from submitting his "article 85" demotion proceedings.  Shakespeare was awarded a bar for his Crimson Sword medal and Figaro was just shy (97 kills) of earning his Kill Badge.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_169829">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169829/#Comment_169829" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-18T08:15:39+00:00" title="September 18, 2008  8:15AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 18, 2008 8:26AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I made it my goal of the evening to mess with Corporal Ruth and totally failed.<br/><br/>It was actually pretty demoralizing - I rolled badly all night and the way the game's set up, that meant in many cases I had no impact on the fiction at all.

Yes, I very deliberately did not put that in as a choice for a success in an encounter. I didn't want PCs to be able to move one another relative to the aliens (either to help or hinder), though I did think about it. In the end I decided that the dice would decide if someone beat the aliens at FA and could move, or could move by just succeeding at NFA (whether they got killed doing so or not).<br/><br/>The rule I would have used would be something like: if you succeed at NFA and you act before another PC then you can move them relative to the aliens rather than yourself. I guess fictionally it would be drawing the aliens towards/away from them to make them closer/further away from the enemy.<br/><br/>In the end I can't remember why I drew away from putting it in. I think the problem would be people happy at their range, and having rolled higher than the aliens so they weren't getting killed, putting others in more danger.<br/><br/>Um, does that sounds plausible?<br/><br/>Oh, NPCs can get moved fictionally by someone succeeding on NFA of course, since NPCs are just colour.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_169876">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169876/#Comment_169876" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-18T11:02:10+00:00" title="September 18, 2008 11:02AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you made a good call ultimately, because however that rule would get used would decrease the fun for someone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_169884">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169884/#Comment_169884" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-18T11:16:04+00:00" title="September 18, 2008 11:16AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I think when you had your bad run of rolls, at least is wasn't an OK roll fucked over by another player, y'know?

We ran two "planets" with four and then five PCs.  <br/><br/><strong>Faberge After Action Report</strong><br/><br/>The squad was led by Sergeant "Senator" Brown (3/7), with Troopers "Shakespeare" Nagy (5/6), McCoy (6/4), and the replacement Maggie Meyer (4/6) and various red-shirted others.  I tried and failed to convince the other players to let me take some extra advances for Meyer, as thanks for all my hard work as GM.  <i>Alas</i>.<br/><br/>The mission began with 3rd Platoon's acting commander, Lt. Brill, giving the briefing.  A distress beacon had been detected from the oddly-named planet <em>Faberge</em>.  The mission was to find the source of the signal, rescue any humans that might be found, and destroy anything else.  The planet survey indicated a desert world with powerful storms, generating enough static electricity to effectively halt all communications.  <br/><br/>Due to 2nd Squad being quarantined with digestive problems (they were fed shark steaks after Degas by the PCs), 1st squad would be on special duty, and leading the retrieval operation.  The squad was issued an experimental set of communications packs and charged with the safe return of each of the 60 pound units.  <br/><br/>After dropping to the surface, the squad led the way toward the beacon.  The comm gear quickly proved itself to be useless.  As they struggled to keep in contact, with the sandstorm scouring their armor, the troopers were attacked by a mess of small sandworms.  <br/><br/>The troopers killed a number of them, realizing that they originated in silvery jelly sacks inside rocks in the sand.  One of the NPC troopers fell, worms inside his suit eating him alive.  Meyer managed to save him by electrifying his armor with her own power supply, killing the creatures.  Shakespeare, intent on fighting the sergeant's authority at every turn, took the opportunity to destroy his special comm gear, ridding himself of it's excess bulk.  <br/><br/>The squad pushed on toward the beacon, wandering lost in the desert, taking damage from the sandstorm.  Finding a large outcropping of rock, Shakespeare recognized it for what it was- an alien hive- and used a Strength at the outset of the fight.  Being "Educated" he recalled his failed-OCS training and how he led a team to destroy a bridge.  He applied that knowledge here, telling the squad to drop grenades and blow the rocks apart.<br/><br/>Finally approaching the beacon source, the squad was surprised to find a 400 year old human colony ship, the <em>MS Andropov</em>, half-buried in the sand.  A ring of alien worms stood between them and their goal, so they engaged.  McCoy started to use a Strength, and held off, waiting to see if Shakespeare might get killed.  Shakespeare however, knowing the lore of the ancient ship, used a Weakness, citing his "Fear of Ghosts."  That settled, McCoy used his memory of blowing things up as a child and began an indirect fire of grenades for a "Bombs Away" clean up of the alien opposition.<br/><br/>At this point, the last threat tokens used for <em>Faberge</em>, Joel transitioned into the next "planet", which was the <em>Andropov</em>, a ship full of "accidental colonists", descendants of the original survivors.<br/><br/>Final kill count:  McCoy 27; Meyer 17; Shakespeare 16; Brown 0.  McCoy and Shakespeare leveled and both ended up successfully earning a promotion to Corporal.  In addition, McCoy took another bar for his Crimson Sword, having finished off the worms.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171280/#Comment_171280" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-25T12:59:35+00:00" title="September 25, 2008 12:59PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<strong>Andropov After Action Report</strong><br/><br/>The squad was joined by acting Platoon Sergeant Snelling as 3rd platoon congregated at the Andropov.  Other squad members were sergeant "Senator" Brown (3/7), with new Corporals "Shakespeare" Nagy (6/6) and McCoy (6/5), and Trooper Meyer (4/6).<br/><br/>The platoon was met by the descendents of the <em>Andropov</em> survivors, a group of 244 men.  It turned out that the women and children- segregated from the men for religious reasons- had recently gone missing.  The troopers were introduced to Brother Albus, the group's leader, who explained that their emergency beacon was powered by the ship's still-functioning fusion core. <br/><br/>Using the beacon to piggy-back a signal, the squad contacted Lt. Brill to report in.  Brill, an oily commander with no combat experience, began pitting Sergeants Snelling and Brown against one another.  When Snelling requested an evac for the survivors, he was denied and they were ordered to secure the area for a supply drop.<br/><br/>Spreading out to explore and secure the ship, the platoon was nearly ambushed as the zealots decided to test the trooper's spirits.  Activating an energy pulse of some sort, they shut down all of the trooper technology, reducing them to hand to hand as the zealots attacked.  <br/><br/>The fighting was vicious, and Shakespeare once again used a Weakness- "Afraid of the Dark", as a result of once being locked in a supply closet as a child.  McCoy used a Strength, describing his years as a champion rugby player and how that served him here as he charged through the corridors in his armor, crushing zealots in his path.<br/><br/>Still split up, the squads attempted to fall back to the fusion core to shut it down.  Meyer and Brown were cut off, and they began sneaking through the dark, avoiding the cultists.  As the fighting began again, Brown used a Strength- "Sneaky"- to turn the hunters into the hunted and reunite with the squad.<br/><br/>Lt. Brill contacted them and was unhappy with the loss of control.  He replaced Snelling with Brown, putting him in command.  Snelling's last act was to attempt to boobytrap the core, but he only managed to create a resonance cascade, making destruction of the <em>Andropov</em> imminent.<br/><br/>Brown ordered a general retreat, and the platoon fought it's way out of the ship.  In the sands outside they were attacked by Albus and his brothers.  Meyer began to use a Strength, but held off, waiting to see if any of the badly-hurt NCOs might die and create an opening for a field promotion.  After a few rounds, however, Snelling stepped in and used a Strength- "Son of a preacher man" to out-preach Albus and his followers, breaking their spirits and leaving them to die with their ship.<br/><br/>As the platoon retreated to a safe distance for retrieval, Shakespeare could be seen to be carrying the broken Brother Albus, saying something about needing a "cabin boy."<br/><br/>Final kill count:  McCoy 16; Snelling 14; Meyer 4; Brown 3; Shakespeare 0.  McCoy and Snelling leveled.  Brown failed in his bid for promotion back to Lieutenant, but successfully got Shakespeare demoted for destroying his valuable communication gear.
