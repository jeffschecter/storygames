She <b>turns her on</b> as her cleavage shows and she asks, "Do you like me?" It's a 9, and my eyes light on <b>give yourself to them</b>. And suddenly Andrea's kissing Luna full on the mouth and trying to pull her on top of her. Luna's date to the dance, Doug, drops his food as he looks out the house's window. The poor emo kid starts to panic, and Catherine, the ghost, is trying to calm him down when the ghoul, her date Todd, arrives. By this point Luna has <b>shut Andrea down</b> and run off into the woods; they're nowhere to be seen, so the two characters throw the skinny wanna-be poet into the back seat of the car and drive off. <br/><br/>Back behind her house, Luna gets the sense that she's being followed. Her <b>heightened senses</b> fail her, however, so as the moonlight trickles in through the trees her skin starts to bristle, her shoulder throbs. Suddenly everything comes into focus - deer hoofprints, the rabbit sprinting through the bush.<br/><br/>And Todd's hungry. So hungry that he drove to the cemetery, hauled Doug out of the back seat, and smashed the kid's head against a tombstone. He's bleeding, and Todd starts asking him how he feels. Does he know how it feels to die? Does he get that dull burning sensation, the ever-present searing that never seems to go away? He <b>lashes out</b> and Doug slumps to the ground. Todd beats him while Catherine watches.<br/><br/>And just as Luna sinks her teeth into the flesh of the rabbit, she gets the sense of something thicker, deeper. Human blood. She's running. <br/><br/>Doug's crawling across the grass, sobbing, when Luna bursts from the trees. She tells Todd to back off, and he does. She pulls Doug to his feet, incensed by the scent of blood. She <b>lashes out</b> and fails, so I make her <b>pay a price</b> in emotional baggage. Doug spills it all - how he's had a crush on her since freshman year, how he's been alone since his parents died in a fire, how he really just wants to be with her. He hugs her. She asks, "Doug, do you want to kiss me?"<br/><br/>He mumbles a yes and then her jaws are clamped around his throat. She tears it out and he crumples to the ground in a mess of blood. Catherine slips her clammy hand into Todd's to <b>turn him on</b> as they get off on this gruesome spectacle. We close.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>My first session, and it worked out beautifully. We all wanted to play again, and scheduled the next date. It seemed like it was all just mundane high school (crushes, IMs, jocks), but then Todd got hungry and it rolled from there. There was a lot of sexual confusion, awkward dinners with parents, emotionally distant and cruel teenagers - everything we wanted.<br/><br/>Bravo, Joe! It was a great game.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362377">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362377/#Comment_362377" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-24T11:25:58+00:00" title="February 24, 2012 11:25AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ethan K.</cite>He mumbles a yes and then her jaws are clamped around his throat.

(Hello, I played Luna.) I'm honestly not sure where I'll want to take things with Andrea. I think a lot will depend on how the next scene opens - moments from Doug's untimely death? the next morning, post-transformation? - but I do know that if I'm going off my own experiences as a high school student I would probably drop things with Andrea on the grounds of her being way too young. Luna's a junior. Like an upperclassman would date an underclassman? Please.<br/><br/>Part of me hopes the next opening starts in the morning because the imagery of waking up with blood caked and congealed all over Luna's face and school dance finery on a sunny SoCal morning is pretty irresistible, but part of me hopes I'll get a little longer embodying the Werewolf's Darkest Self. We'll see where that goes. <br/><br/>I'll fill in some of the gaps from a player perspective in a few hours, after I've had a chance to mull over it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_362420">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362420/#Comment_362420" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-24T13:16:43+00:00" title="February 24, 2012  1:16PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: foulowl</cite>Like an upperclassman would date an underclassman?

Please.</blockquote>\nDate, no.  Have sex with in secret, creating all kinds of complex shame structures, yes, totally!<br/><br/>Hah, yes. In completely agreement there.<br/><br/>Overall the progression of the narrative felt very smooth and natural, mostly due to Ethan's adept MCing and Jake and Alex's bold playing. For all the melodrama it didn't feel contrived. These archetypes are pretty deeply ingrained, and it was fun to just go with them.<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to playing out the effects of being closeted on Luna, as a werewolf and a burgeoning queer character. The former might take more time to develop since we set the game to start a day or two after she'd been bitten, so she still isn't fully cognizant of what's happening. Which, now that I see it in writing, is neatly analogous to her confusion and ambiguous reaction to the charge between her and Andrea.<br/><br/>Other things that come up often in teen monster dramas that could be fun to explore, assuming they happen organically within the narrative: the presence (or lack thereof) of mentor figures to help with the monster transition and general navigation of the supernatural (and are those mentors peers, or of her parents' generation, or somewhere in between?); introduction and further development of other monster NPCs (the French foreign exchange student was revealed to be a vampire towards the end of the game, I think); the struggle against/surrendering to impulse and desire (pull between being "domesticated" and "wild") at the heart of most modern werewolf stories; physical violence as a symbol of resistance and growing autonomy, or a destructive curse, or both, or neither; the malleability of memory (will Luna remember what she did to Doug? I'm not sure yet); creating moral codes; etc., etc. Honestly, even if none of this gets touched on I think it will still be a blast because the mechanics of the game facilitate a giddy acceleration of action and immersion in one's character that I <i>loved</i>. All the metaphors occurred to me later.<br/><br/>On that note, here are some things I really liked about the mechanics of Monsterhearts:<br/>- I like the way experience is accounted for with the basic moves. All of us players seemed to build experience at a similar rate, some edging forward ahead of others at some points, but generally coming up at a similar rate. It gave the game a nice sense of forward momentum that I enjoyed without a superimposed "goal" that I felt like I had to aim for. <br/>- The Strings didn't come into play very much during the first session but I can feel their impact looming over future sessions. Which is so great! That's one thing potential power differentials are about, that unease over how things will play out to one's disadvantage in the future. Awesome.<br/>- The flexibility within the <b>turn someone on</b> move has been commented on before so I won't elaborate too much, but I really liked how well it worked.<br/>- Interestingly, I thought I'd use the turn someone on move most but I think I ended up <b>shutting people down</b> way more. If anything I like the shut someone down move even better than turn someone on, but I think of the two as being natural opposites and it was the most fun when they were used in quick succession or in tandem amongst different characters.<br/><br/>Anyway, yes. Monsterhearts is the second story game I've ever played and I enjoyed it a <i>lot</i>. Well made, Joe!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_369228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ethan%20K." title="Ethan K."><img alt="Ethan K." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2475/3619178655_cd765940c5_s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ethan%20K.">Ethan K.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369228/#Comment_369228" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-26T09:50:10+00:00" title="March 26, 2012  9:50AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The second session write-up is here: <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=16000&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=16000&amp;page=1</a><br/><br/>We wrapped up things last Friday, but mostly we<b>lashed out</b> at each other:<br/><br/>Luna, the werewolf, tore apart her crush in a dream while snoozing through history class.<br/>In homeroom she <b>lashes out</b> at the asshole who calls Catherine (the ghost) a slut.<br/>In the ensuing chaos, the teacher (who's having an affair w/ Luna's father) tries to pull her off the asshole. Luna attacks her teacher, who flees to get security.<br/>The ghoul and the ghost make out, and the ghoul's old flame attacks the ghost; Cat pushes her towards the open 2nd-story window and then goes all Poltergeist. Luna flees.<br/>Todd, the ghoul, locks the door after everyone's left. He then smashes the asshole's hand with his boot, and Catherine drops a bookcase on him. His old flame opens the door to let the administration in, and he drops the security officer to the floor with a swift kick to the balls. He leaves.<br/><br/>Luna fights the French vampire, briefly, then lets him feed on her so he can calm down. They talk about how confused they are, how they always end up hurting people.<br/>Catherine wants revenge on the doctor that killed her. She beats Todd to the doctor's house, and asks Luna to come get Andrea (her crush) out before the ghost and the ghoul take their vengeance on the mad scientist. <br/><br/>Luna makes out with Andrea in the car, takes her home. It's around sunset, and they can see the moon in the sky.<br/><br/>Catherine fucks with the doctor, screams and weeps at him (but he cannot hear). She breaks wine glasses, fires the shotgun that he gets out of his case after he loads it. He unloads it, flees the house. She hears inhuman howling beneath the kitchen, finds a barred basement door that seems to have trapped something.<br/><br/>Luna leads Andrea down a hallway in her empty house, suggestively, as Todd follows the suggestions of his invisible friend down a similar hallway. He refuses to go down into the basement, so Catherine unbars the door. The decaying corpse scrambles up the steps towards him - he misses, slips, escapes and blasts it to pieces as it attempts to consume everything that's in the refrigerator. Catherine lights the house on fire, and as Todd watches it burn down from the outside he says, "I really wish you were here" - she reappears, hand in his.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Luna's transforming fully for the first time. She bars the door, tells Andrea to run. The girl does, but Luna's father comes home and she tears him to pieces, covers herself in his gore and feasts on his insides. She leaves her darkest self, becomes human again, all naked and bloody. Her father's dead, but she knows who could save him. She races to the hospital.<br/><br/>The ghoul and the ghost find the doctor in his office at the Experimental Hospital, crying over the preserved corpse of his dead wife. He sobs something about how he only wanted to bring her back. His two subjects step inside, lock the door. They shout at and berate him, smash him against the cold, metal railing. Todd enacts his vengeance: He makes the doctor feel as he does, all burning cold and dead but not dead. Andrea arrives and Catherine trips her, knocks her out cold.<br/><br/>Then Luna's there, all bristling fierce. She fights for control of the doctor with Todd - she grabs him, then trips over Andrea and freezes. Todd takes a bone saw to her shoulder and she lashes out at him, nearly severing his head and tearing open his chest. Hot on the blood, she begins to transform. Catherine beats the doctor to death with her bare hands, and then races through the hospital, flees home. Luna kills the ghoul, sending him to the floor. Fierce and hungry, she murders Andrea and races away into the night.<br/><br/>We see Catherine, bored and despondent, in a (less full) home room class.<br/>We hear of sighting of a strange, large animal up and down the California coast.<br/>We see Todd reawaken in the morgue, stretch his limbs, and sets out. A series of unsolved murders take place on the highway. He's never found.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
