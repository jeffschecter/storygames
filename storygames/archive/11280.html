Some examples of what i mean:<br/>\n<br/>\nKing Arthur is pure and chivalrous in a perfect way, and this virtue and courage alone make him able to face any threat (i  guess that somewhere in the idea of the Perfect Kinght lies the assumption of not just facing anchy challenge, but  actually overcoming it): the thing that ultimately brings him down it's the consequence of his only sinful deed, his bastard son Mordred.<br/>\n<br/>\nTydeus, the greek hero, is torn between his intelligent courage (he is protected and guided by the goddess Athena) and a bestial strength and violence dwelling inside him: in the moment this violence takes over, when he smashes  his enemy's  head and eats his brain, athena diverts his eyes from him just a moment, in which he is  struck down.<br/>\n<br/>\nGoing more modern, the moment Paul-Muad'dib Atreides sees the future and starts using visions to guide his way, he is doomed to be trapped in his visions, without any chance to escape it. this is a case in which both the reader and the character are aware of this process (when he's young, he is often anxious about the Jihad he  sees swarming the galaxy in his name)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs i always tried, in RPGs, to jump from the 'fantasy' to the 'myth' level and feeling, this is really something that i find interesting, and that maybe i would like to see as a mechanic: something like, the more the character gets larger-than-life and powerful, the  more he is bound to a particular Fate. one way could be that of giving the character the chance to accomplish incredible deeds and influence the game reality in a very powerful  way, but every time he does that he gets more trapped into a myth  he won't be able to control. What to do, then? live on the edge? be free, in the shadows? or face your destiny, whatever it may be?<br/>\n<br/>\nis there a game accounting for such a narrative process? how would you develop such a mechanic or idea?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_250603">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Albi_SG" title="Albi_SG"><img alt="Albi_SG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Albi_SG">Albi_SG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250603/#Comment_250603" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-13T06:30:35+00:00" title="January 13, 2010  6:30AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On second Thought,  it  might be  managed a little bit like the humanity/morality/etc. in the whitewolf games, with some mechanics from the virtues in Exalted (pushing to compel behaviiours in the players)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_250763">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250763/#Comment_250763" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-14T07:26:07+00:00" title="January 14, 2010  7:26AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You should check out some of the discussions on Ryan Macklin's Mythender RPG.

It seems like mythender really takes on some aspects of what i was talking about... even though it goes in a slightly different direction... mainly, the myth engulfing the characters is someting external... in my mind, it was really something coming from the character itself, and succumbing to some kind of personal fate, more than becoming locked in an unchanging myth... <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is actually interesting... many mythical characters DO have some kind of fixed, inescapable destiny, but their personal history IS unchanging till the very  end (the best example of this is the Ragnarok myth, in which this destiny is also  foretold, and thus known)... it seems that mythender identifies  the myth taking over the character with entering this locked status of un-change, while i was more aiming it at the inescapable destiny at the end of the road... (you are playing the barbaric paragon, slaying wild beasts with your bare muscles and fury? you will succumb to that fury, becoming a sort of beast yourself, lost to humankind...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_250957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarvis" title="Jarvis"><img alt="Jarvis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/neastrith1/Smiley_Avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarvis">Jarvis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250957/#Comment_250957" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-15T00:17:31+00:00" title="January 15, 2010 12:17AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            White Wolf wrote Scion as well. Scion is about the modern day sons and daughters of the old gods being 'awakened' to their divine natures and kicking titan ass. <br/><br/>A major part of the game is Legend. Legend is the general power level of the Scion, the pool they draw from to activate their awesome powers, and the curse of being more than a normal man.<br/><br/>Whenever a Scion uses Legend in a scene to affect/harm/help someone, there's a chance (esoteric mechanic that needs simplifying) to see if that someone becomes "Fatebound" to the Scion. Fatebinding means the someone assumes a Fatebound Role (sidekick, nemesis, lover, mentor, apprentice, fan, traitor, etc) whenever the Scion is nearby.<br/><br/>All these Fatebindings basically create the Scion's legend as his old friend becomes destined to hate him and the evil chick becomes destined to love him. All you'd need to do for the result you were looking for is to give the Scion himself a Fatebound Destiny that gets closer with each badass battle or maybe each time he causes a Fatebinding.<br/><br/>****<br/><br/>HELLAS does something similar by starting every character with a Destiny and a Fate. The Destiny is the bad ass thing that you will accomplish if you live long enough. Fate is the horrible thing that will happen if you burn out too soon. Any time the player needs a little extra juice for a task, they can use Fate for a boost to their roll. A number of bonus points are added to the d20 roll for the task, but if the actual die reads 1-5 (no matter what the end total is) during a Fate roll, the character's Fate increases. A character only has 10 or so available steps on his Fate track.<br/><br/>Also, mini-goals can be set by the player. Accomplishing those goals drops the character's Fate back down a step.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251117">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Albi_SG" title="Albi_SG"><img alt="Albi_SG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Albi_SG">Albi_SG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251117/#Comment_251117" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-16T04:53:30+00:00" title="January 16, 2010  4:53AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            mmmh... the hellas system looks like really interesting, i'm reading it at the moment... thank you, i guessed there was something out there but did'nt know where to look... which is funny, cause i actually played Scion (even though it was a one-shot, and we didn't have that much interaction with normal people... )                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
