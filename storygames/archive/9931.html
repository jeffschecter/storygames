In cases of rule violation, conflict of interest, misrepresentation or other factor(s) detrimental to the awards, the Board of Directors retains the right to alter the composition of the judging panel at any time.</blockquote>\nThis (emphasis my own) is really difficult around here. A quick perusal of this forum will reveal that hundreds of Story Games' members are publishers in some capacity, and that many of us have been involved in playtesting, design feedback and more.<br/><br/>Earlier on the same page, you said "The judging panel, comprising fans and other individuals unconnected to <b>the products submitted by publishers</b>". More people here would be eligible judges if that were the case - that we only had to be removed from the products actually submitted.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
