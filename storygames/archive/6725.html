Which isn't true at all - if you keep playing, you keep playing the odds. Eventually the odds will turn against the players and they will lose. All perpetual games have a predictable end - the players losing.<br/><br/>That, or it's not possible to lose in the game. This may mean as a whole, the game loses as the tension players thought was there (the tension born from being able to lose) is completely lost. Note: Some players don't mind games where you can't lose - that's fine and good. But I'm going to ignore them in this thread, as that's kind of evidence the whole win/lose thing doesn't matter to them. <img alt="&gt;:)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/naughty.png" title="&gt;:)"/> Oh, and if the players retire their characters before the big lose then they can leave on a win - but then, that stops the game being perpetual.<br/><br/>It's not something that's immediately obvious, but when you look past any concern about whether they will make it past a boss, and realise there will be a boss after that, and after that, and so on, you know relief at passing any boss is kind of missplaced. It's just relief that the inevitable has been delayed.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149154">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149154/#Comment_149154" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-09T18:32:55+00:00" title="June  9, 2008  6:32PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like an ending.

I think in most "let's go on forever" campaign play, the assumption is that character death isn't losing in the sense that it knocks the player out of the game, it's just a temporary setback and the player is expected to make a new character and keep on going.<br/><br/>I mean, looking at stories, check out soap operas. They have to keep tension up, to keep people coming back and watching. In fact, to a certain degree, all of soap operas are nothing more than tension adjustment techniques.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149159">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/elmago79" title="elmago79"><img alt="elmago79" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i44.photobucket.com/albums/f41/doguiii/rdh12.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/elmago79">elmago79</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149159/#Comment_149159" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-09T18:56:13+00:00" title="June  9, 2008  6:56PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Callan S.</cite>Okay, the idea is that if a game is ongoing, eventually the players will lose.</blockquote>\nI can get behind that idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149163">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marco" title="Marco"><img alt="Marco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marco">Marco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149163/#Comment_149163" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-09T19:13:36+00:00" title="June  9, 2008  7:13PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What if they consider a good death ... <i>winning</i>.<br/><br/>:-O<br/><br/>-Marco                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149178">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149178/#Comment_149178" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-09T19:58:05+00:00" title="June  9, 2008  7:58PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 9, 2008 8:01PM by Callan_S.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Then it's a game you can't lose.<br/><br/>Edit: Oops, lazy reading on my part, I notice the requirement of it being a 'good' death.

Maybe some guards will find you, and you'll have to try and roll a quick Lie Your Ass Off check to come up with a reason for skulking about the castle.

So in my campaign we pick a suitable place to end the campaign, usually when a major story arc have been solved. Sometimes there is a sequel, at other times the story ends there and the characters lived happily ever on till the end of their days.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149229">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149229/#Comment_149229" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-10T05:02:31+00:00" title="June 10, 2008  5:02AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Callan S.</cite>The insight isn't that you risk a bad ending/losing, it's that losing is simply a matter of time.

I see TONS of unexpressed assumptions here...<br/><br/>Let's say that I play "Charnel Gods". At the end of the game my character (or your character) will destroy the world, ending existence. This was my objective, from the beginning. I lost the game?<br/><br/>But let's say that you simply forgot to exclude game that have some sort of endgame condition. Let's try another example.<br/><br/>For example, let's say that you play an ongoing game of The Shadows of Yesterday. The player get his character to transcendence (in practice, "winning" the game, if you see play as winning or losing),  then he create another character. How this can be called "lose"?<br/><br/>Do you want to add another condition? No endgame for any character, too? But... "death" IS an endgame condition. Do you exclude that, too?<br/><br/>Do you want to talk only about "traditional" rpgs? Well, let's talk about Call of Ctulhu. At the end, if you don't stop the game at some point, your character is crazy or dead. Great! This is what I wanted from the game, to play something like the old Lovecraft stories where the "hero" get crazy or dead at the end!<br/><br/>Are you going to tell me that ME, the player, "lose" if the character die, NO MATTER IF i WAS THE ONE THAT WANTED HIM DEAD?<br/><br/>The problem of this thread is that is hanging on fog. What doest it mean "the players will lose"? Will lose WHAT? Time? Respect? Self-worth? Money? a bet? a character? <br/><br/>Define your terms. What you talking about when you say "game"? You include PTA? (that can be played ongoing. Think of the Simpson, so many seasons and there is no stopping...) You include TSOY? What are you including here?

If the players have fun, then I think they win. I gather what you mean is that the characters lose - they die, or in some other way completely fail to achieve their objectives.  Because Moreno brings in good points, in this light. What happens if, during the same game, you play four characters? What if the first three characters all "won" and got retired (this could be TSoY trancendance, Hero Banner retirement, or just plain ol' D&amp;D feeling that the character is done and setting it aside) and then the last one dies, or the game ends, or whatever counts as a lose condition?  But what if character death was the "right" way to end the character's story and the player is happy with that?<br/><br/>In a way, I think games without an end, players do lose. And it's not just games that don't have an ending planned, but games that don't reach an ending. In games I've played that didn't end, and I'm left with a dissatisfaction that we never got to the ending. There's a desire to "get the band back together" and finish it, but due to life changes (usually the ones that caused us to stop playing) that's all but impossible. So, in a way we all lost, every player, GM included. But we had fun on the journey, and really that's the important part. So, I'll take that minor loss over the win of every session leading up to the anti-climactic ending.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149355">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149355/#Comment_149355" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-10T12:26:13+00:00" title="June 10, 2008 12:26PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think maybe folks are focussing too much on details.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust like at the casino...if you let it ride long enough you lose.<br/>\n<br/>\nHOW you define lose is really irrelevant, and even mentioning character death is something of a red herring.<br/>\n<br/>\nConsider:  You play, you have a completely wonderfully satisfying amazing ending to your characters story.

How is that surprising to you? You should stop drinking before you vomit, stop skiing while it's still daylight out and you're still alert and in good physical shape to continue safely, leave your host's home before you overstay your welcome, and you should plan to end a game before it sucks - which means you should plan to end it while people are still having fun. I assume all those other non-game things aren't a revelation to you. <br/><br/>I mean, you stop playing 4E with your son at some specific point in the evening, because its time for bed or whatever, right? You end before he gets super-cranky from being over-tired and things just suck, despite his protests to the contrary, right? Ending on a high note is a good thing. So long as a coherent story with a beginning, middle, and end is good, then you should plan an ending. <br/><br/>Personally, having experienced both fizzle endings and planned endings many times each, I've found the planned ones infinitely more satisfying than the fizzle ones. <br/><br/>But, on the other hand, I know people who always drink until they vomit and stay out until they wish they'd never been born, year after year of weekends, so maybe this is a personal preference on my part.

Roll stealth!<br/><br/>Just because failure is<i>possible</i>, doesn't mean that the result of this roll is predictable. Maybe you'll make it. Maybe some guards will find you, and you'll have to try and roll a quick Lie Your Ass Off check to come up with a reason for skulking about the castle. Maybe you'll fail that, and have to make a Dashing Swordfight check. Maybe you'll fail that, and get thrown into the dungeon, and have to make a Bust Your Ass Out Of Jail check. And so on.<br/><br/>If you make an arbitrarily large number of checks with a nonzero chance of failure, yes, the probability does get increasingly large that you will lose one of them. But that loss doesn't necessarily end play, it just takes it in a new direction.<br/>Yes, it doesn't necessarily end play - your talking about a game where you can't lose at all. Any failed dice roll just results in a new tricky situation, which if you fail, results in a new tricky situation - forever. You never lose, you just get more interesting situations. And that's fine - great even! From what I see, alot of people play that way and don't mind that they can't lose - it's not a problem to them. But I'm ignoring you guys in this thread - I'm talking about guys who have a losing condition that ends the game, but also want a perpetual game.<br/><br/><br/>Hi Ralph,<br/><br/>Damn, took the words right out of my mouth!

Yes, each single intance of a coin flip has the same chance. The thing about gamism, is that it <b>declares</b>, completely out of the blue, that say you need to get five heads in a row to win. Or ten heads in a row. Or twenty. You would agree that the more heads <i>in a row</i> you need, the more likely you will lose? Now, if you have a declaration that you keep needing heads...perpetually, then your going to lose at some point. The declaration is faulty, I know - that's the discussion point of the thread.<br/><br/>From what I understand, sim has no such <b>declaration</b>. Each moment is just a moment, issolated from all others in terms of meaning/declaration, except for cause and effect. This discussion is very much about that declaration being there, but being faulty.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149471">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149471/#Comment_149471" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-10T19:32:48+00:00" title="June 10, 2008  7:32PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Callan S.</cite><br/><br/>Hi Moreno,<br/><br/>The point of your actual play example was to get the highest score(level) before death, wasn't it?

But the characters weren't at the same level (the campaign was always ongoing, without ever restarting. When a character died, the new character who did take that place started at first level with zero xp), so you weren't going head-to-head until you were the last one standing.

Surviving an encounter is, obviously, the result of many complicated factors, but it doesn't seem even remotely a problem to summarize a single encounter as a single risk -- a single chance for the party to be wiped out, say. After all it's not like Tony's kid made every single roll in order to win the encounter; he just happened to make enough of them, or play well enough, or whatever. He risked and won. Your claim is that inevitably he will risk and lose. This is not actually true. You really can stand there flipping a coin and die of starvation before you flip tails. Moreover, the odds of D.'s party dying in that first encounter are identical to the odds of them dying in any other similar encounter -- so I'm totally unclear <i>how anyone would modify their behaviour</i> based on this fact. You can't end the game before it starts out of fear that it will end poorly -- and the chance that it will end poorly <i>is already as large as it will ever be the very first time you play</i>.<br/><br/>I see absolutely no inherent assumption in 'Gamism' or D&amp;D that says this risk must increase as the game progresses. D&amp;D explicitly designs for the opposite (at least in previous editions): the chance of a party failing at any particular encounter is the same for a level 2 party and a level 15 party. So the whole 'flip 10 heads in a row to win' thing makes no sense to me, and your Sim/Gamism division just seems to be obscuring the issue.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150032/#Comment_150032" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T09:06:25+00:00" title="June 12, 2008  9:06AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Callan S.</cite>Yes, it doesn't necessarily end play - your talking about a game where you can't lose at all.

And WRT advice, the only advice is "be aware of it, and make less experienced players aware of it." The greatest thing Paranoia brought to our gaming group was becoming comfortable with character death and mission failure. Sure, you'd get your clone--My Guy, Mark II, formalized in the system--but even then, there were plenty of Code Seven missions (all seven clones of all players killed).<br/><br/>The pragmatic "take away" point, here, is to be aware of the game risks and consequences of failure, and suck it up when you go down (eww, that came out wrong).<br/><br/>As for the "end on a high note" points: I adopted another LARP's rule as a primary Toggle in my system, GLASS. It was Walt Freitag's Commit Rule: in brief, a character that was "down" (0 HP, torso hit, whatever) didn't automatically die; rather, IF the PLAYER "committed" then the character was instantly restored to full HP (whatever) BUT, the next time they went down inthat conflict (loosely defined--I am more rigorous in GLASS), the character died permanently. No resurrection, no GM fiat or divine intervention: gone. Walt's goal was to make death meaningful, and to do so he left the choice of when a player would take that risk in the player's own hands, NOT in the systems mechanics and NOT in another player's hands (PvP PKing). "Brilliant!" I thought, and immediate bult two different, Prime Toggles for GLASS; World Priority (Killing Blow or Slay = Dead) and Player Priority (Commit). Resurrection is ONLY a World Priority rule, and even then it has (at last count) Three Toggles (one of which is No Resurrection) and two Options (orthogonal to this thread--just stuff about "costs" of rebirth or whether there are chances of failing to Res).<br/><br/>SO, in short, the Commit rule works to help players hit high notes, to go out dramatically, with a bang. Dread TFBOP has a similar mechanic with the Retirement rule: you get DOUBLE full Life and Fury, but you WILL die at the end of the case (if not sooner)--go out with a BIG bang.<br/><br/>Um... rambling. The larger point I wanted to make is that a Player Priority "style" person in a World Priority game is going to feel the suck, when he's Killing Blowed. Thus, GLASS makes that very axis of play--call it NAR vs GAM, if it's convenient to imagine the distinction--a clear, obvious, principle statement about a game type. In other words, it communicates the risks and threat, from the player's perspective, on their agency in the fictional world. Unique and Special Butterfly? Or Just Another Grunt?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151082">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/M%20Eryesen" title="M Eryesen"><img alt="M Eryesen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/M%20Eryesen">M Eryesen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151082/#Comment_151082" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-16T15:30:04+00:00" title="June 16, 2008  3:30PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 16, 2008 3:30PM by M Eryesen.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Callan S.</cite>It's not something that's immediately obvious, but when you look past any concern about whether they will make it past a boss, and realise there will be a boss after that, and after that, and so on, you know relief at passing any boss is kind of missplaced.

It's just like life.  There will be another day and another, until you eventually die.  What will you do while your heart is still beating?  Quit?  (kill yourself? drink yourself into a stupor every day and refuse to face yourself?  go into a catatonic state?)  Find others to share it with?  Decide your priorities are meaningful enough?  That your will is reason enough?  Seek out a higher power?  Find meaning in being part of a community or something larger?  Throw yourself into chasing pleasure?  Sounds a lot like how King Solomon learned his great wisdom from God.<br/><br/>I would *love* a scene where the players have their characters realise this.  Right after they defeat some big bad guy and save the world.  And then realise there will be another.  And probably be another.

characters we've all created for this imaginary world.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven more importantly, in the groups I play with, there's always somebody who has got a great idea for the NEXT campaign that I want to try out and if there was no set ending for the damn thing, we'd never get to see those other games.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really do prefer short campaigns, actually, but I play a long one if I know, for certain, the thing will end (and, hopefully, end magnificiently, for a given value of magnificient.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE
