I personally feel that OSR games are not great for story-based gameplay in the traditional sense; I believe that there are stories that emerge from the procedural gameplay, but trying to have characters drive a plot in a dungeon crawler where they're a failed roll away from death is not optimal. Your mileage may vary, in my humble opinion, and the usual host of other caveats apply.<br/><br/>An idea emerged through this discussion: why not have players control lineages instead of mere individuals? One player might hold the Starks, another the Tyrells, a third the Lannisters, etc., creating a large pool of related characters to draw from. When Robert Baratheon perishes due to a failed initiative roll against a boar, it's easy enough to pick up and play Cersei or Jaime or one of his numerous relatives.<br/><br/>Expanding upon this, one could then pursue leveling up the lineage parallel to individual characters. You could tie this to various abilities within the game world. One might use this increased level for certain narrative and mechanical bonuses. Providing a better education to progeny, all freshly-created characters gain a +1 bonus to Intelligence. Marrying off a daughter or son could become a viable bargaining chip. The accumulation of family fortune would allow for permanent retainers and standing armies, that sort of thing.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468582">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468582/#Comment_468582" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-22T23:22:04+00:00" title="December 22, 2017 11:22PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like this idea - I've long wanted to play an OSR game where the players start with a "stable" of characters who are, essentially, the group's hit points.

RPGs produce very specific sub-genres within these minor, but well-established, literary genres.<br/>"Old school" RPGs are really bad, on the other hand, at producing stories within such beloved fantasy sub-genres as the faux-Tolkien saga, the Star Wars/Shannara-style hero's journey or the swords &amp; sorcery short story. Despite borrowing motifs from those all, they are not designed to play like those. When you try to force them into doing that you get... well... any random underwhelming RPG campaign since ca 1985. :P                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468585">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468585/#Comment_468585" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-23T02:08:45+00:00" title="December 23, 2017  2:08AM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" rel="nofollow">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Expanding upon this, one could then pursue leveling up the lineage parallel to individual characters.

AD&amp;D tried to be lots of things at the time, although story wasn't what Dark Sun had in mind - the premise was that because the Dark Sun setting is so super-duper lethal (it isn't, it's the same "oh we're so tough" illusionist bullshit that every other setting sells) you need to have multiple characters so you have an already leveled backup in case yours dies.<br/><br/>Which, incidentally, segues into the idea that you might want to look into <i>Dragonlance</i>, <i>Ravenloft</i>, <i>Planescape</i>, <i>Birthright</i> and other such TSR products that attempted to do precisely this: make D&amp;D into a more story-oriented experience. It's not a new idea, and all kinds of stabs have been taken at making it happen. I'm not even touching the long list of stand-alone adventures that experiment with socially motivated NPCs and such over the years.<br/><br/>Aside from those points I don't have anything useful to add, as the brief is relatively vague and OSR D&amp;D is just about the furthest from anything I'd view as a story game myself. It produces fun stories for us all the time, but that's a side product and not the actual goal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468589">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi" title="yukamichi"><img alt="yukamichi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/677/nHW6876KEN77F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi">yukamichi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468589/#Comment_468589" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-23T14:11:54+00:00" title="December 23, 2017  2:11PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can see how this might give more context to a series of linked games but I don't really understand how it makes things more "story-based." But beyond that, more than rules or aesthetics, I've always thought of OSR as a pretty clear coherent creative agenda (see: Old School Primer) that would be in conflict with story-driven play. Contextualize things all you want if it makes the game more fun (and it can, don't get me wrong!), but I don't see how you won't start to hit rocky ground if the context becomes so big that it starts driving play, rather than the OSR creative agenda itself. This is part of why many people think of pre-name level and name level play as two different beasts.<br/><br/>Whitehack sort of attempts what you're describing by using <b>Groups</b> to codify and constrain the "What if my background gives me a bonus?" player move while still largely attempting to conform to a freeformish OSR player-challenge context. In general I think that's a big part of Whitehack's shtick, taking the vague and unbounded "player creativity" that's at the heart of OSR play and giving it slightly more definition in the form of class powers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468601">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468601/#Comment_468601" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-24T02:36:45+00:00" title="December 24, 2017  2:36AM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This approach, ie. a stable of characters, is a central element of Pendragon.

(By "naturalistic", I simply mean that it will be a string of events and developments, but almost certainly won't follow "story logic", have clear and resolved story arcs, consistent characters, or address themes.)<br/><br/>I can imagine either:<br/><br/>1) A massive campaign where different players portray different forces and groups within the setting. <br/><br/>On Friday night, five people come over to play. They represent the family of House Redd. Tonight, they are a group of mercenaries hired by Duke Redd to inflitrate Castle Greene to steal some important item. Let's say the manage to pull it off:<br/><br/>On Saturday, three other players, representing the Greene clan, are told that this  important thing has been stolen, and what will they do about it? Then they go off on some adventure...<br/><br/>2) The same players play different factions in the campaign simultaneously. Perhaps they portray House Redd's mercenaries until they die or seem to have concluded their adventures for now, and then, the next session they play someone else:<br/><br/>"We know the pirates of Dunn have been up to something off the West Coast of the island. Let's take a session to play a pirate crew, and see what is going on in that part of the world."<br/><br/>"Ah, interesting! That was a failed raid, but they released a demon on the countryside after a magical mishap. Very well, next week you'll play the local Guard Captain and his crew, and we'll see how they react to the fallout of those events..."<br/><br/>Over time, an image of the campaign, world, and some sort of naturalistic narrative evolves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468611">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468611/#Comment_468611" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-24T18:13:52+00:00" title="December 24, 2017  6:13PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How does Pendragon handle "generational stories"?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468613/#Comment_468613" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-24T20:36:04+00:00" title="December 24, 2017  8:36PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Each Pendragon session is basically presumed to represent a year of in-game time: summer is when your characters go questing (they're all knights), winter is when they're taking care of their estates and living their downtime. In a long campaign time flies.<br/><br/>Those downtime periods have their own rules for various events, including things like marrying, having children, expanding the mansion, whatever - lots of room for dollhouse play in there.<br/><br/>As time goes by, characters get retired due to injuries or old age. The assumption is that you'll switch to playing other characters, which by default would be the eldest son of your old character, him being the presumed heir to the old character's position in life.<br/><br/>All this is by no means hard-coded, but the material presumes and encourages it thoroughly. The so-called "Great Pendragon Campaign", for instance, which is basically what you'll want to play if you're playing Pendragon, spans a notional 80 years or so. Plenty of time for characters to grow old and young ones to have to deal with the choices of their fathers.<br/><br/>All in all it's similar to Ars Magica in many ways, including the creative agenda and the tools it uses; one could get similar generational story effects in Ars just as well, basically.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468614">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thai" title="Thai"><img alt="Thai" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thai">Thai</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468614/#Comment_468614" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-24T22:21:37+00:00" title="December 24, 2017 10:21PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that I need a few preliminary questions, before I can truly suggest my two shillings on the matter:<br/>1)\tWhat is a story game for you?

I come from a different tradition of gaming. In this tradition, we believe that gaming should be total, total in that every part of the game should enhance, but also create, the intended feel of the game. But in order to do that, one needs to understand what she is trying to achieve. <br/>\tNow, you want to make an OSR game more story gamish. That's cool, and the idea you suggested sounds brilliant. But there is a single problem: I think that you try to tinker with the surface structures of the genre, at least from my point of view, rather than tinkering with what I consider the right and deep-rooted parts of the genre.

Contextualize things all you want if it makes the game more fun (and it can, don't get me wrong!), but I don't see how you won't start to hit rocky ground if the context becomes so big that it starts driving play, rather than the OSR creative agenda itself.

I was a huge fan of <i>Ravenloft</i> (and the <i>Masque of the Red Death</i> expansion) back in the day of AD&amp;D 2e, but the experience was far from what I wanted. Essentially, settings like <i>Ravenloft</i> were swimming against the current of AD&amp;D as a system. The setting begged for a character centred game, with decently competent starting characters and an appropriate reward system. AD&amp;D, with its origins in a completely different philosophy just led to dissonance: very weak beginning characters that could die just because of a bad roll on session one; a reward system that made everyone loot dead enemies for magic items and coin (and kill stuff in the process); getting better equipment and magic items by buying or looting the dead all the time; emphasis on managing your backpack, etc. It was completely at odds with the experience that <i>Ravenloft</i> was supposed to be providing. At the time I couldn't really put my finger on it so I did what everyone did (and still does): tweak lethality, make XP less dependent on the system as written, etc. Later with The Forge and GNS theory I realised what was wrong: my creative agenda (and the one I felt was appropriate for <i>Ravenloft</i>) and AD&amp;D's mechanics and reward system were totally at odds.<br/><br/>It's no wonder that Dungeon World (like it or hate is irrelevant here) is so popular with the masses these days as an alternative to D&amp;D, and it is, ironically, a far better match for settings such as <i>Ravenloft</i> than AD&amp;D ever was.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468795">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vgunn" title="vgunn"><img alt="vgunn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vgunn">vgunn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468795/#Comment_468795" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-10T02:33:03+00:00" title="January 10, 2018  2:33AM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            IIRC Houses of the Blooded did this. Reign by Greg Stoltz as well. For example (from an RPG.net thread) someone posted:<br/><br/>House Stark of the North<br/>Might: 3<br/>Treasure:2<br/>Influence: 4<br/>Territory: 2<br/>Sovereignty: 5<br/><br/>The Starks have a lot of land, but it's worthless. Their troops are mighty but few, and while their accounts are scrupulously balanced their coffers run thin. Still, when House Stark calls, the banners come, and with Eddard Stark's dual role as lord of the north and hand of the king, their voice is heard among both the common folk and the nobility.<br/>House Baratheon of the the Stormlands <br/>Might: 2 or 5<br/>Treasure: 2<br/>Influence: 4<br/>Territory: 2 or 5<br/>Sovereignty: 5 or 3<br/><br/>Baratheon itself, in the hosts of Renly and Stannis, is militarily rather weak sauce. If you don't include the resources of the Iron Throne, the house is a 2 in Might and Territory, but a 5 in Sovereignty. If you do include the Iron Throne, their Might and Territory rise to 5 but Sovereignty drops to 3 -- King Robert has very few friends in his own court, and his personal power relies on people being afraid of the Iron Throne and not the sad, fat drunk sitting on it. <br/>House Lannister of the Westerlands<br/>Might: 3 or 5<br/>Treasure: 5<br/>Influence: 5<br/>Territory: 3 or 5<br/>Sovereignty: 3<br/><br/>Lannister is an ungodly gold machine, and the real power in the king's court. Personally, they an extremely well-financed and surprisingly well-led army, but their lands are small (albeit very rich in gold). If you assume that Lannister has the real power of the Iron Throne, then their Territory and Might each jump to 5 -- at the beginning of the novel, no one can seriously challenge them. Their sovereignty should probably be a point higher under the guidance of Tywin Lannister, but there's always been a lot of tension. <br/>House Tully of the Riverlands<br/>Might: 2<br/>Treasure: 2<br/>Influence: 3<br/>Territory: 4<br/>Sovereignty: 4<br/><br/>Tully's lands are rich and valuable, and the house is well-loved by its citizenry. Their troops are not exceptional, though, and their coffers aren't particularly impressive. Their influence is largely the result of their intermarriage with Stark and (presently) undisputed hold of the Riverlands. <br/>House Arryn of the Vale<br/>Might: 2<br/>Treasure: 2<br/>Influence: 2<br/>Territory: 1<br/>Sovereignty: 3<br/><br/>House Arryn doesn't really matter. The Vale is not strategically meaningful except as a holdout, and while their troops could hold it against incursions, they can't do anything else. Arryn isn't even much loved by its own bannermen, though the whole lot of them tend to cling close if only for mutual protection. Assume that the Vale gives a large modifier (a master die?) to the defender and that's that.<br/>House Martell of Dorne<br/>We don't really know. At a guess:<br/>Might: 4<br/>Treasure: 4<br/>Influence: 4<br/>Territory: 3<br/>Sovereignty: 3<br/><br/>Martell appears to be a very, very formidable threat. It doesn't seem particularly close-knit (certainly not to the degree of, say, Stark), and its lands are vast but not of superlative quality. Martell doesn't slouch in any category. Only geography keeps it from being a major contender in Westeros, and even that can be overcome.<br/>House Tyrell of the Reach<br/>Again, we don't know -- we're not introduced to this house until much later, when their situation is different. At a guess:<br/>Might: 3<br/>Treasure: 4<br/>Influence: 3<br/>Territory: 5<br/>Sovereignty: 3<br/><br/>Tyrell has the best lands in Westeros, and quite a bit of wealth to show for it. At the beginning of the series, however, the family's bannermen don't seem particularly loyal to them (no moreso than any other great house), and they don't seem to be a dominant military power or a particularly loud voice in the court. All that, naturally, can change dramatically with a single good alliance, or a single fallen opponent.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" title="ValyrianSteelKatana"><img alt="ValyrianSteelKatana" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468819/#Comment_468819" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-11T16:24:32+00:00" title="January 11, 2018  4:24PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Thai" rel="nofollow">Thai</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I think that I need a few preliminary questions, before I can truly suggest my two shillings on the matter:<br/>1)\tWhat is a story game for you?

However, the discussion was in regard to introducing certain storygaming elements into OSR play, keeping the basics of the OSR gameplay while moving it in a direction of character goals and ambitions beyond amassing wealth and power.<br/><br/>1. A storygame is any sort of game whose mechanics first and foremost emulate and create a story: character-driven gameplay, plot arcs, internal and external conflict, growth and change. All of these elements happen in traditional roleplaying games, but storygames have mechanics to force them into the gameplay, things like Hx, the Artha cycle, and Fate points. In addition, storygames often grant a more equal role between players and GMs (if there is a GM at all) in authoring elements of the game world, which paints a sharp contrast between the traditional RPG in which that burden (and privilege) is foisted upon the GM.<br/><br/>2. For me, it is more of a thought experiment than anything, but there are certain appealing elements of an OSR system that I enjoy: random character generation, lethality, a relatively simplistic system, escalation of character power. All of these are things that I find somewhat desirable in an RPG, be it a storygame or a traditional game.<br/><br/>3. Kevin Crawford's definition of "Keep on the Borderlands compatibility" is suitable.

Particularly these ideas of character-driven gameplay, plot arcs, internal conflict, because as you state, these happen in traditional RPGs. "Story games have more of this" is too loose a definition, and inaccurate because there are "traditional" and "story games" which don't fit in the mold. Ergo, it doesn't define two separate genres. <br/><br/>Having a codified rule for personality (etc) which mechanically influences the story just introduces another stat. May or may not produce story (although I readily concede that it usually does have a heavy influence on the types of stories which are told).<br/><br/>I think the defining attribute of a story game is shared GM/narration/resolution responsibilities.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Thai">@Thai</a> <br/>Story game doesn't have a GM at the hub. Apocalypse World, Lady Blackbird, are traditional RPG at the core, with some shared narration as the difference from 80's OSR.<br/><br/>OSR is a nostalgic throw back. Simpler rules. The difference between Red Box D&amp;D and 3.5 is a lot of stuff added on. The heart is still there, with layers of crunch over the top.<br/><br/>If a story game really has no GM (that's the definition I use) then no, OSR can't be used for story games, because of procedural reasons. But it's not for "story" reasons. <br/><br/>Can OSR tropes be used in story games? Sure. Why not? <br/><br/>The big problem is that people conflate that story=emotional story. Or that mostly action story=story without important emotional elements.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" title="ValyrianSteelKatana"><img alt="ValyrianSteelKatana" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468822/#Comment_468822" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-11T17:24:56+00:00" title="January 11, 2018  5:24PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Particularly these ideas of character-driven gameplay, plot arcs, internal conflict, because as you state, these happen in traditional RPGs. </blockquote>\nI should clarify: they <i>can</i> happen in traditional RPGs, and they <i>often</i> happen in traditional RPGs, but they are entirely optional.

We don't need another definition war. <br/><br/>I'll leave you with this thought: GMless and GMed games have a clear, defining line, right? And Ben Robbins says that if you have the "ability to affect what happens in the game [in]dependent[ly] [of your] character\u2019s fictional ability to do those things," it's a story game.<br/><br/>Those are both good definitions, pretty solid.<br/><br/>But, hang on.<br/><br/><b>Problem One: </b><br/><br/>Historically, the term "story game" was invented for and used by people who wanted to have a way to talk about their GMed RPGs which supported their desire for a certain type of dramatic narrative. <br/><br/>The most important "story games" which were initially labeled with the term all had GMs. (I'm thinking of games like <i>Sorcerer</i>, <i>The Pool</i>, <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>, <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i>, and so forth. Arguably, <i>Apocalypse World</i> is of the same lineage.) Don't forget that GMless RPGs didn't (or just about didn't*) exist back then, so those were the games we were talking about.<br/><br/><i>(*: You certainly couldn't buy one in the RPG section of a gaming store, for example.)</i><br/><br/>Similarly, many had *some* (but only a few) mechanics which allowed a player to "affect what happens in the game independently of their character". Many traditional games already had those features, though.<br/><br/><i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i> and <i>Apocalypse World</i> don't necessarily give you more ability to do so than trad games with Hero Points and Bennies and similar mechanics. In <i>GURPS</i>, I can create an NPC out of thin air by taking an appropriate Advantage or Disadvantage, for example. ("Disadvantage: Powerful Enemy", or whatever they were called.) In <i>Feng Shui</i>, I can do something (my memory is hazy) to introduce cool props into a fight scene, and so forth.<br/><br/><b>Problem Two:</b><br/><br/>Those lines aren't all that clear, anyway. Some easy examples (not great ones; I'm typing this without much forethought - a clever person could do much better):<br/><br/>We're playing a game. It says, "the first player narrates everything else while the second player portrays a character and describes what they try to do." Sounds traditional, right? Not a story game, clearly.<br/><br/>But... the next sentence says, "for the second session, invite another friend, and create a character for yourself to play. And so on, for each subsequent session."<br/><br/>Now what? Is that a GMed game? Or GMless?<br/><br/>What if we only play one session, and stop? Surely that's not GMless then, right?<br/><br/>Ok:<br/><br/>What if the rule applies not *each session* but *each hour*? <br/><br/>...each scene? ...every five minutes?<br/><br/>Or, it's definitely a traditional, GMed game, as described earlier, but then a rule says, "...but once in a while, you can get one or more Red dice. You can spend a Red die to narrate anything you wish, for one full minute."<br/><br/>Now is is a story game?<br/><br/>What if we don't ever exercise this option? Then what are we playing?<br/><br/>And so forth.<br/><br/>We played <i>Dog Eat Dog</i> recently with Jeff. That game has a player take on the "Occupation" role, which means they play most of the NPCs, don't have their own (singular)  character to play, present the opposition to the characters played by the other players, and have almost unlimited power over the other players' characters. (For instance, you can't succeed at anything at all in that game unless the Occupation player allows it.)<br/><br/>However, we didn't even know who it was going to be until we started playing, and we got to take turns framing some scenes, too.<br/><br/>It's possible for the players to "win" the game against the Occupation, and the Occupation isn't allowed to change the rules of the game or play outside them in any way.<br/><br/>Is this GMed or not? I have no idea. <br/><br/>One more example:<br/><br/>We get together to play D&amp;D. <br/><br/>I say: <br/><br/>"Hey, I'm tired of being the DM all the time, and running a game for you four. From now on, Claire, you are going to play ALL the PCs. I'm going to tell you what the environments you enter are like, and give you adventure hooks you can pursue. Bill is going to handle all the rules, and tell everyone what to roll, how much damage anyone takes, who has to make a saving throw, keep track of hit points, give out XP, and so forth. Jules, meanwhile, will play all the NPCs. But only unless you get into a fight with them, because Lucia will be deciding what all the monsters and opponents do in a fight - and if you fight an NPC, they become your opponents. Makes sense, right? Lucia, you're good at doing cool descriptions of combat, right? I know you are. Ok, let's go!"<br/><br/>Is this a GMed game? I don't know. Is it a story game? Probably not... but maybe? We haven't really changed any of the rules of D&amp;D!<br/><br/>Final example:<br/><br/><i>Apocalypse World</i> has a GM (MC). Seems traditional. The MC narrates stuff about the "world". You say what your character does.<br/><br/>But then the MC turns to you and says, "Hey, what do people eat around here?"<br/><br/>You answer, "Not much these days, because a terrible drought started a month ago!" Everyone nods. "That's cool! Totally that."<br/><br/>Now what are we playing? By Ben's definition, it's a story game, just from that one statement (maybe, but certainly if we keep doing it). You have the ability to affect things beyond the capacities of your character, clearly, and you're exercising it fully. By your definition, it's not, though, because there's a GM.<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/><br/>I've thought about this a fair deal, and I find that recognizing "story game" as, first of all, a label everyone uses a little differently, and, second, as pretty reliably indefinable in any concrete way, is the proper solution.<br/><br/>We accept this reality with other words, like "game" and "story", after all. That's how our language works.<br/><br/>To get back on track:<br/><br/>I think the OP's meaning here is pretty easy to determine. The OP wants to keep playing OSR-style D&amp;D (or something like that) but modify their play in some fashion so as to create more, or more satisfying, dramatic events, character growth, plot twists, or other things which we would recognize as elements of "story". (I don't know which ones specifically, of course.)<br/><br/>How do we know when we've modified the game enough that it isn't D&amp;D/OSR anymore? We don't. It's up to the OP's taste. (See my D&amp;D example earlier!)<br/><br/>How do we know when we've made this game "story game" enough? Same thing - we don't know, it's up to the OP's taste.<br/><br/>(ValyrianSteelKatana, I trust you'll correct me if I've misread you, of course!)<br/><br/>So, what are some elements of story or narrative that you'd like to see in your OSR games, ValyrianSteelKatana?<br/><br/>I think what you're suggesting would create some interesting large-scale dramatic developments over the long term. (e.g. Over three sessions, we find out that a dynasty has fallen and a robber baron has taken over the region.) But it wouldn't be as likely to create tales of intimate, personal transformation. And the large-scale developments wouldn't, generally, happen "at the table", in vivid colour and passionate narration.<br/><br/>Lots of nuances here!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468849/#Comment_468849" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-11T23:15:14+00:00" title="January 11, 2018 11:15PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm with Paul here. I've been around since the late years of the Forge, which is enough time to realize the definitions here are entirely relative and make no sense once an exception appears, and new games and ways of playing old games appear every damn time to ruin any previous definition that stood after a long and bloody war over terminology.<br/><br/>Like, by OSR like games we are prone to understand one thing that is quite different from a story game. But then we make a story game about a group of people on a world full of opportunities but no obvious nor detailed limits on morality and ethics, a fantasy world where they can easily strive to be whatever they want since laws of causality and physics can be overthrown on the roll of a die, where a dangerous maze is used as a metaphor for how easy is to get lost in life and miss opportunities for being too ambitious instead of cautious, or being too cautious all the time. And then make it so it also rewards people who are too shy to roleplay and prefer to get things done by getting the right combination of rules, numbers and situational bonuses, or do resource management the right way.<br/><br/>See what I did there? Basically, OSR games are story games specialized in producing a particular type of story, as most story games. What's actually happening there is that they seem to offer a type of story that doesn't fit your expectations, as while they draw elements from tolkien and other medieval fantasy fiction, the type of story they produce is far removed from those, and trying to make the game fit them tends to give less than consistent outcomes.<br/><br/>Is it fixable? Perhaps, or perhaps you will need a whole new game for it. To know for sure you will have to explain a bit more about the type of story you want the game to produce. There are some important clues in the things you listed before, but I'd say there's still a bit more of information missing to be sure if you just need a couple of houserules or a whole different rulebook.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
