Games where you say "Okay, this is what's important here" up front and the resolution mechanics follow that. I like the kinds of dramatic conflict they create.<br/><br/>I'm also still a newbie as far as playing them goes.<br/><br/>What I'm looking to get out of this thread are some tricks to improve my play, ways to do this straight-up with existing games or little tweaks I can make to add these to existing games. I really love hearing about new game ideas, too, if you have something you want to share.<br/><br/><br/>Anyway, I'm thinking...<br/><br/>There are times when I feel like a scene features multiple layered dramatic conflicts. Here's an example...<br/><br/>Let's say you're an exiled samurai (well, some kind of fantasy samurai so this scenario actually makes sense). You've come back to face your nemesis. He's very powerful, but you've just succeeded in calling him out to a formal duel. It's duelin' time. This is where you say what's at stake and play out a conflict.<br/><br/>What's at stake is "Do you reclaim your honor?" That's a really big deal here.<br/>But there's more drama in the scene than that. "Who wins the duel?" is also at stake.<br/>Maybe your once-beloved is watching and "Do you rekindle her love for you?" is also at stake.<br/>Since this is a really important scene, handling all three of those would be pretty cool. Just focusing on the first one and narrating the other two in gets weird, especially since "Die to reclaim your honor" is certainly a potential outcome there, but I think it's a bit weird that the dying can pretty much be just a side-effect there.<br/><br/>Maybe you can think of another one or two that might totally make the scene cooler, too. The way I see it, the scene's a lot bigger and more dramatic if I run those in parallel rather than series. And it'd be cool if they could influence each other a bit.<br/><br/>Which instantly reminds me of Vincent Baker's little game <i>Otherkind</i>. The way you have multiple elements of a scene and you allocate dice between them. I've heard <i>Bliss Stage</i> is going to have a similar mechanic.<br/><br/>So, I guess in general I'm thinking about how I'd take <i>Otherkind</i>'s approach and join it to a game with long-conflict resolution and flexible stake-setting. Like TSOY, for example.<br/><br/>I think, in the most basic sense, one could actually just run the resolution engine in parallel. Roll separately for each conflict and skip back and forth. This can be troublesome if you just put it on top of an existing game: it tends to make for massive quantities of Bad Stuff building up very quickly, which quickly throws you out of all the conflicts in a TSOY-like system or saddles you with massive fallout in a DitV-like system.<br/><br/>Also, just running the conflicts in parallel would be missing out on a really nice feature of games like <i>Otherkind</i>: getting to choose how to spend your dice. So what if you're, like, doing that with long-form resolution without hard-wired things at stake? Like maybe I roll a bunch of dice and then decide how to allocate them between "Do I restore my honor?" and "Do I win the duel?" and "Do I recapture the admiration of my beloved?" That'd be kinda cool if done right, I think.<br/><br/>It also seems like an alternative way to look at complications. If the possible complications get big enough, you can run them as a concurrent conflict instead of side-effects! Which might then let you trade additional complications for a better chance to accomplish your goal (this is, essentially, what <i>Otherkind</i> does with some pre-set complications).<br/><br/>I'd love to hear someone with more experience elaborate on how this kind of thing could work.<br/><br/><br/>Links for your convenience:<br/>- <a href="http://zork.net/~nick/loyhargil/tsoy2/book1--rulebook.html" rel="nofollow"><i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i>'s resolution mechanics</a><br/>- <a href="http://www.septemberquestion.org/lumpley/other.html" rel="nofollow"><i>Otherkind</i></a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/oliof" title="oliof"><img alt="oliof" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.mausdompteur.de/gravn32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/oliof">oliof</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62406/#Comment_62406" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-29T03:50:58+00:00" title="March 29, 2007  3:50AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Shadow of Yesterday players do not control stakes, only their characters' intentions. Stakes are set by the SG[0]. And, in The Shadow of Yesterday, a character can only ever follow one intention at a time in BDTP. So, yes, there are these multiple layers of stuff concerning you: Your honor, your survival, and your beloved judging you. The drama is in here: What is most important for you? You cannot possibly control every aspect of of your life, but you may be able to control what you hold most dear. In an RPG, the rest is at the mercy of free play, if I may say so.<br/><br/>So, in TSOY you BDTP because you did a simple conflict. But BDTP doesn't need to be about what the simple conflict was, if one of the characters changes her intentions. Like in the conflict that leads up to the situation in your example, the conflict could've been "I want to fight the duel in an honorable fashion" against "I want to kill that bastard regardless of the means"[1]. Regardless of who'd win that simple conflict according to the dice rolled, <i>when you go to BDTP Land, no one's dead yet, and nobody regained their honor</i>. Since your opponent wants something entirely different than you, you will have to avoid that (otherwise, there wouldn't be conflict). This  way circumstances can reinforce a choice you need to make.<br/><br/>I'm a big fan of side implications, because they give power to the idea that your actions and intentions may have consequences you cannot easily control. And these consequences are what you chase after to make right if they're wrong, all the while perpetuating the world of adventure with more decisions that have expected and unexpected consequences.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>[0] Yes, there is negotiation, but in an extreme case the player can only step back from an ability check or a conflict but has no input to the stakes as set by the SG.<br/><br/>[1] Observe that depending on circumstances, either intention may be chosen by the character or her opponent, the samurai.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_62407">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62407/#Comment_62407" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-29T04:46:19+00:00" title="March 29, 2007  4:46AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: oliof</cite>The Shadow of Yesterday players do not control stakes, only their characters' intentions.</blockquote>\nTrue, but open to varying degrees of latitude.  In my group framing a conflict always begins with asking the players what stakes they'd like to set, and we go from there.  <br/><br/>A couple of general "tricks" - you can control point of attack in your framing.  So maybe whether you win or lose the duel isn't the issue - it's about honor, or love, and you know you are going to win (or with my friends, <i>lose</i>), so what you are really defining through conflict is what that win means, and what it is going to cost you.  That can be fun, and gets away from a cause-and-effect grind.<br/><br/>If you have control over stakes, you can also frame them in ways that push the story in the direction of harder choices.  My pal Remi is famous for his "If I lose, he gives me the briefcase full of money.  If I win, he shoots me in the stomach" stake-setting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62424">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chris_moore" title="chris_moore"><img alt="chris_moore" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://jesus8880.com/chapters/gematria/images/greek%20letters/psi-cap.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chris_moore">chris_moore</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62424/#Comment_62424" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-29T07:52:49+00:00" title="March 29, 2007  7:52AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Check out Vincent Baker's Otherkind conflict dice categories, or my variant, psi run, posted on the Forge.

It's Conflict Resolution at the macro level.  It resolves the real issues when someone finally gives.  But it also deals effectively with the question of "what happened" during each individual round inside the BDTP.  The individual round actions are really more Task Resolution or at least can be handled that way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_62468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62468/#Comment_62468" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-29T13:22:02+00:00" title="March 29, 2007  1:22PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is something I've been thinking about a lot lately, heavily influenced by <i>Shock:</i> and <i>Otherkind</i>. Both of those games deal with multiple vectors of conflict really well.<br/><br/>The Dogs system throws stuff in at the level of Raises. A Raise is something your opponent can't ignore, right? So, you're dueling for your honor: that's what's at stake in resolution. But then your opponent raises with, "He puts his sword clean through you, you feel cold inside." Do you save your big dice and Take the Blow on that one, or do you Block? Either way, you put your weight behind how the actual swordfight is going, in the fiction.<br/><br/>And then maybe you raise back with "Kimiko sees my blood stain the palace floor, and her tears fall like rain." If you're fighting the guy who is trying to steal her from you (and yeah, you so are) then he certainly can't ignore <i>that</i>. Will he Take the Blow (and thus allow that to occur in the fiction) or will he shift his big dice around to stop it? Thematic decisions, backed up by system, moment to moment.<br/><br/>So yeah, on paper, something like Dogs or TSOY just has one thing "at stake" that the resolution system is resolving, but because of how the systems are structured, the players actually get to address lots of complications, side-effects, and other bits of fiction as the conflict plays out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex" title="Alex"><img alt="Alex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex">Alex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62487/#Comment_62487" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-29T15:35:06+00:00" title="March 29, 2007  3:35PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a really cool example, John.

In the samurai example, there'd be three:<br/><br/>1. Honor<br/>2. Life<br/>3. Love<br/><br/>When you roll dice, or whatever (I'm partial to dominoes these days), then you have to make choices given the three values you produce. These numbers, in turn, could be bolstered by resources or knocked down by GM adversity.<br/><br/>That being said, I think John's got a really good point about how conflict can work in the other systems. Following from that, in systems like, say, <i>The Mountain Witch</i>, which have the chance for "partial" success results (as does <i>Otherkind</i>, now that I think about it) layers of stakes can play out in a quick series of connected conflicts. Which is, I guess, maybe a less formal way of doing <i>Dogs</i>-style resolution.<br/><br/>Or you could <i>nest</i> conflicts somehow, like a combination of <i>Dogs</i> and <i>Otherkind</i>: You determine how many facets there are in a given conflict, and then roll a differently-sized die, depending on where you want a facet in the overall hierarchy, with the larger dice being more important to the overall shakeout.<br/><br/>Um, that was wordy.<br/><br/>Samurai again: <br/><br/>Honor: d8<br/>Love: d6<br/>Life: d4<br/><br/>That's all I got right now.<br/><br/>Aaron                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_62530">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62530/#Comment_62530" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-29T23:00:13+00:00" title="March 29, 2007 11:00PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm reading TSOY like you are, Andrew.

Within BDTP, you can do all sorts of different actions to go after your intent.<br/><br/>However, unlike Dogs, being in BDTP doesn't stop you from doing stuff<i>outside</i>the BDTP, and thus making a roll for something different. So, yeah, you're swordfighting for your honor, but then you also want to Sway someone who is watching. Nothing wrong with that.<br/><br/>Doing this would probably count as your "action" for the round, so you may lose ground in the BDTP or leave yourself undefended, depending on the specific situation.

That's an interesting thought. I don't know what it means, exactly, but it makes me think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
