I was wondering if there were any hacks out there? I think it lends itself to different genres out of the box, but I see no reason a conversion wouldn't be possible (though a lot of work, admittedly). I'm a bit of a graphic designer myself, so I'm quite tempted to go at it alone with a Mythos or Sherlock hack, but I'd be keen to find out what's out there (if anything)!                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424236">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thadrine" title="thadrine"><img alt="thadrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thadrine">thadrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424236/#Comment_424236" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-15T06:23:46+00:00" title="November 15, 2013  6:23AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 15, 2013 6:24AM by thadrine.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There used to be a line of children's Sherlock Holmes (or was it Inspector Gadget?) books that played almost exactly like this. They were also coloring books, which also might a cool mechanic to incorporate. <br/><br/>I have no idea where they can be found, I saw a bunch of half finished copies at doctors office years ago.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
