As making your way through the dungeon by wit and skill was a large part of the game, players seeing that, even by accident, could deflate the fun fast.  <br/><br/>That was about the only time I can remember using a GM screen and feeling like it was really needed for what it was. The maps were so visual, and so easy to read on even a glance, that keeping them where I could see them and the players couldn't was an issue. Games where the information is mostly secret notes and such is much less of an issue, as its harder to accidentally see something that will spoil the game with that sort of information. <br/><br/>I also, when I used to play really robust games, would put a GM screen down flat so everyone could see the handy reference tables on the back. Then I figured out I could do that much cheaper with my printer, and that pretty much killed the screen for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239624/#Comment_239624" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-29T10:48:11+00:00" title="October 29, 2009 10:48AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think they are for:<br/><br/>1.

By setting it up just to my right, I have the benefits of a secret space to store notes, without putting up the divider between myself and the players. <br/><br/>It conceals notes - stuff like investigative flowcharts and social links between groups. I don't roll behind it, nor do I hide behind it, but it is a very nice tool to keep some materials secret from the players. I clip papers to the screen and have my notebook on the table behind the screen. <br/><br/>This has caught on in most of the groups I play in also, with most of the GMs using something similar, even those who don't normally use screens. The laptop GMs also do the same thing now, placing the laptop to the side, putting a screen around it, and putting paper notes over the keyboard of the laptop.

Then as I grew less concerned about that, they were great for being pretty and evocative. I still seek them out because, most of the time, the rules reference is really fucking handy. I didn't pick up the 4E DM screen because almost all its charts were errata'd so I didn't see the point. I'm not sure if the ones in the store are "fixed" or not.<br/><br/>And now, well, now mostly no games I play use them. This is probably a good thing since most indie games don't have the budget to get a really pretty mural (I presume - maybe the cost for a mural for a $10-15 screen is not too bad)<br/><br/>For games that have them, I still use them because of the art and the rules reference.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239848">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239848/#Comment_239848" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-30T15:19:52+00:00" title="October 30, 2009  3:19PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            GM screens are great because:<br/><br/>* setting physical stuff up for your game is great<br/>* having a place to keep all your notes and such where they are distinctly yours is great<br/>* having a physical marker of a person with a special role is great (like the Investigator's Notebook in Dirty Secrets)<br/>* limiting the space you take up at the table is great - otherwise all your junk will sprawl out and ruin everyone's fun<br/>* having reference material close to hand is great<br/>* having something to hang pictures on where everyone can see them is great<br/>* having a place to put the group's name cards is great, say, in keeping initiative order<br/><br/>Basically there are one billion great things about GM screens and they are objectively terrific in every way.<br/><br/>If you have a GM, that is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
