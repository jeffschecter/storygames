The same game where they concocted a hairbrained scheme to kill them by burning up silk tapestries laced with cyanide to produce cyanide gas... heck I dont know what they were trying to do, but its not like the system even factors in something so odd, sooooo the GM made stuff up on the fly which sucked cause it was her first game ever as a GM.<br/><br/>In this case though the players deliberately tried to break the system by attempting to do something outside the rules, requiring someone to make up rules...<br/><br/>crazy. but Im not entirely sure where Im going with that.</blockquote>\nI don't know what Maddrjeffe meant when he meant that Rule Zero was useful in situations like this ("You fail"? That has its own sets of problems...). But, when I saw this problem, the first thing I thought was, "Oh, shit... time to <em>stall</em>."<br/><br/>Let me try to explain. I mean, yeah, if I find myself in this situation, it's likely that I overlooked something before the game began, because I get this feeling that players don't start dicking around with you on rules unless there's an underlying problem with the game you're playing. <br/><br/>But it's also certainly likely that players will try something innovative and unexpected that you yourself didn't figure. If that's the case, what do we do?<br/><br/>I've found myself in a couple of situations like these before: again, mostly because of lack of planning on my part. Fine, okay. The thing is, though, when I was in that kind of bind, the first thing I did was to ask as many questions as I possibly could about the situation that the players wanted to engineer. In other words...<br/><br/>How did they know that the tapestries had cyanide with them? <br/>Do their characters know if the poison would remain in the silk, even after the silk had been washed and treated for display? <br/>Do their characters know if the poison would be released as cyanide gas if the tapestry is burned? <br/>How are they setting up the fire? <br/>Do they know which direction the Tong guy is coming? <br/>What do they know about the Tong guy's armaments, equipment and bodyguards? <br/>Do they have an escape route?<br/><br/>That sort of thing. And at this point, while I'm taking down their answers, I'll be asking myself further questions: <br/><br/>Would the tapestry burn easily? <br/>Would it release smoke if it burns, or would it <em>too easily</em>? <br/>How would the gas behave? <br/>What kind of gas would it be (would it still be lethal)? <br/>Would the players have a good idea where the gas would go (or do they miscalculate)? <br/>Would the players be able to control the fire? <br/>Would anyone be alerted by the burning tapestries? <br/>Does the Tong guy prepare for situations that involve poison gas? <br/>Does the Tong guy know about this plan? How would he know about this plan? What would he do to counter it?<br/><br/>One way to answer this question would be to structure each and every one of these questions in some way as a conflict or a task to be performed -- basically, a dice roll and a lookup table. If you have a generalized conflict resolution method, this is useful. If not, I suppose you make it up -- Rule Zero again! <br/><br/>In any case, a suggestion or a plan that would throw off a GM has been turned into an interesting situation, or at least a hilarious clusterfuck ("He's got a gas mask! Shit! The fire's spreading! Geez, someone put it out -- why are you all lying down?")<br/><br/>Am I doing it right here? What other ways would there be to handle unexpected situations from your players? What do you guys think?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daztur" title="Daztur"><img alt="Daztur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daztur">Daztur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149500/#Comment_149500" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-10T22:34:58+00:00" title="June 10, 2008 10:34PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What I generally do is when the players come up with a creative an innovative plan I just go along with it and let it work in most cases, I can be a bit of a pushover that way.

In the original post, Maddrjeffe says that the players were "meant to" have a throwdown with the bodyguards. Rather than structuring games around what the players are meant to do, you can just see throw situations at them and see how they respond.<br/><br/>I think the questions you ask yourself are good. Some general rules-of-thumb, I think, would be:<br/><br/>1. Try to build on any idea that a player gives you. So, if they burn down the tapesties because they're cyanide-laced, don't say "Yeah, there's no cyanide in there" or "Yeah, there's cyanide, but it burns when you burn the tapestries."<br/><br/>2. Having said that, don't be a push-over. You're allowed to block ideas that seem lazy or wildly unrealistic. If a player says "Oh, I throw a rabbit at him, which claws him to death.", you're allowed to say "No, that doesn't work."<br/><br/>3. And you're allowed to add complications, too. Just because they've released the cyanide doesn't mean the bodyguards can't attack as they're choking to death.<br/><br/>(Um, I need to subtly plug my book <a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/1436677" rel="nofollow">Play Unsafe</a>, which is all about this stuff.)<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149516">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/T-Boy" title="T-Boy"><img alt="T-Boy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/T-Boy">T-Boy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149516/#Comment_149516" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T00:45:25+00:00" title="June 11, 2008 12:45AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 11, 2008 12:45AM by T-Boy.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham W</cite>1.

See if there are rules for poison gas (or, failing that ... drowning--the most mock-worthy of rules, I'm sure!)<br/>2. I would be totally confused by this approach to generating poison gas--and I would ask the group if they had ever heard of deadly burning silk? I might google "silk cyanide smoke"<br/><br/>(shockingly, I found this: <a href="http://carolinanewswire.com/news/News.cgi?database=1news.db&amp;command=viewone&amp;id=1763&amp;op=t" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://carolinanewswire.com/news/News.cgi?database=1news.db&amp;command=viewone&amp;id=1763&amp;op=t</a>\n<blockquote>Fire smoke is a common source of cyanide exposure. Cyanide may be produced by the pyrolysis (incomplete burning) of common synthetic or plastic materials as well as from natural materials such as wood, paper and silk. Cyanide is increasingly recognized as a common and dangerous component of fire smoke, adding to the effects of carbon monoxide as a fire smoke toxicant. In fact, cyanide poisoning and carbon monoxide poisoning most often occur together during a fire. Prompt recognition and treatment of cyanide poisoning with an antidote can save lives.</blockquote>\nAnd from another link:\n<blockquote>Recent research has revealed that hydrogen cyanide present in smoke generated at building fires may play a more significant role in injuries and deaths of firefighters and civilians than once thought.</blockquote>\nSo it seems that, yes, burning silk can produce cyanide. <br/><br/>3. <b>However</b>: reading the links, burning silk does not produce invisible, deadly cyanide gas--it produces cyanide laced <i>smoke</i>--and the deaths associated with it are the kind associated with <i>smoke inhalation</i>: this means that there's got to be a lot of smoke. So if creating a massive, smoky fire will kill the guy then some portion of that danger will be from the added poison.<br/><br/>4. So okay: I would discuss this with the group and say that their plan will <i>essentially</i> involve killing him through smoke inhalation--not subtle and not fast. It'll also obscure the room.<br/><br/>I would use the drowning rules (possibly modified) to run the encounter if they decided to go along with it.<br/><br/>-Marco                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149534">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149534/#Comment_149534" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T04:41:29+00:00" title="June 11, 2008  4:41AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: T-Boy</cite>What other ways would there be to handle unexpected situations from your players?

We had a full table, four elves on one side and four dwarves on the other. As the game wore on, one of the players, who was turtling quite a bit, was looking more and more uncomfortable, stopped doing anything.<br/><br/>Luke ran to the bathroom during a break.<br/><br/>"Guys, I don't think this is what he intended for this adventure at all."<br/><br/>He said it as if it was a terrible thing, as if we were ruining the GM's plans.  He was so stressed out and upset.<br/><br/>"I think this is the kind of thing that he wanted.  He didn't have a hard and fast plan."<br/><br/>The constipated player didn't look convinced but he did eventually loosen up and rock out for the latter part of the adventure.<br/><br/>From then on, whenever I started a game at a con with gamers I didn't know, I'd say, "I don't know where this game is going to go but that's cool, we're all going there together and I'm sure it'll rock."  This not only let's players know to go for it full throttle, it also let's them know what kind of gamer I am.  I've seen players visibly sigh in relief and relax when I've said that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149576/#Comment_149576" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T07:32:30+00:00" title="June 11, 2008  7:32AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't plan for anything.

I've seen games that soared because everyone was coming up with stuff. I've seen games crash and burn due to poor planning and lack of prep. I've GM'd games where I railroaded players and they loved it.

I sometimes don't know how to react to what players do. Here are some things that may help you:<br/><br/>1.) Graham Walmsley wrote a book called Play Unsafe. The groundbreaking advice he gives in that book is: "Be boring". It is very hard to resist the urge to make things more awesome, more tense, more face-stabby, more glitzy. But push yourself to just say the most obvious and easy thing that comes to mind.<br/><br/>The players light the tapestries on fire, pouring cyanide smoke into the room? My first thought on how to react is that the room fills with black smoke, then I decide that's not cool enough, and decide they start sporadic explosions and a little girl who's caught in the smoke poses a moral dilemma.<br/><br/>Okay, that's stupid. That's stupid because a room full of cyanide smoke was intense enough. So I back up. I describe the black smoke. I describe the obvious thing, which is that the only pursuit possible is a clumsy pursuit at this point. And probably one guys gets through, and maybe the players kill him. the obvious and boring thing is that he dies easily and quickly, which totally doesn't give away their location to the blind chasers. And probably some of the chasers are smart, and the obvious and boring thing would be that they pull back and start looking for the long way out, totally de-escalating the current station because that's the obvious thing to do.<br/><br/>And... that freakin' rocks. Now you have a squad of pursuers who are racing to cut off the PCs, and the PCs aren't sure where they are coming from... the first one went down easily, but he was caught by surprise. So we're still not sure if they are formidable foe.<br/><br/>And then if one of the players asks about the dead guy, you COULD say that he is holding the Vial of Gladeron, but that's too interesting and surprising. You could say that he is the PCs' long lost brother/ex wife. Again, too interesting and surprising. So you do the obvious, boring thing, and describe him as being plain-ish, in his mid-twenties, and clean-cut. And you realize that maybe now is the perfect time to describe what they're up against, so you mention that he has grenades, a semi-automatic pulse weapon, and well-defined forearms. And you want some kind of visual marker to describe how he's a badass soldier, so you reach for the low-hanging fruit. The most obvious thing you can find, which is stolen right out of bad 80s action movies: He's got a big, grizzly scar running the length of his face.<br/><br/>And bam. That was so obvious. So boring. So exactly typical.<br/>And it fucking rocks. Go and read it again. Not only does it rock, but because it's all typical and expectable, it gives players a lot of ground to jump from. If you'd described things in this innovative, intense way... it'd have closed many more doors.<br/><br/>2.) "The Mountain Witch Trick"<br/><br/>Leave the players to fill in the important/interesting detail. So, "most of your pursuants were caught in the smoke, and only one managed to make it through to you in reasonable time. Who was it?" Alternately, ask, "But as the smoke filled the room, it suddenly dawned on you why this course of action would pose problems for you. Why is that?"<br/><br/>The tricky thing about solitaire poignancy is that it really requires you to be on your A-game and pander to everyone's interests. And sometimes, you are right there. But this thread isn't about the moments where your GMing pops. It's about when your GMing fails to pop. So, when you aren't sure what the shiny, make-everyone's-head-nod-simultaneously moment is, ask someone else to finish your sentence.<br/><br/>The brilliant part about this is that no matter what the person answering says, it's correct. You've given their answer absolute authority, so that they can answer confidently. By phrasing that question, you've pre-loaded their answer with importance. By having it be a two person collaboration, you've proven that it wasn't pre-planned, and that spontenaity will help it rock.<br/><br/>3.) Ask the players<br/><br/>The simplest thing to do in this situation is say "Wow. That's a pretty innovative twist. I'm kind of stumped as to where to take this..."<br/><br/>And then follow that up with any combination of:<br/>"Where did you see this going?"<br/>"How would the bad guys react?"<br/>"What will you be doing next if things go according to plan?"<br/>"What if the smoke doesn't catch?"<br/>"Who is doing what in this situation?"<br/>"What would happen next?"<br/>"Can any of you guys help me out here?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149623">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SweeneyTodd" title="SweeneyTodd"><img alt="SweeneyTodd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SweeneyTodd">SweeneyTodd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149623/#Comment_149623" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T09:28:52+00:00" title="June 11, 2008  9:28AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 11, 2008 9:29AM by SweeneyTodd.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I honestly thought the advice to describe an outcome as generic and boring as possible was some kind of sarcasm I was missing. Then I reread it, and you're absolutely right -- now I can think of a half-dozen times where my rush to get "the cool" in there as fast as possible ended up boxing out player input. That's genuinely useful advice, thank you. Very much ties into the GM as Bass Player metaphor.No need to do all the riffs and power chords yourself.<br/><br/>I have no illusions that I'm the most creative person at the table just because I'm running the game. Hosting a party and being "the life of the party" are different hats and I'm always happy to not have to wear both. So I definately throw "what then?" back to the players, a lot. (Honestly, enough that we could probably run a game with that as the sole mechanic.) In those situations I feel lucky for all the table talk we have (plus, I just plain enjoy the chatter) -- it's a rare case where one of those "What the hell happens now" situations come up that we don't have at least half the table kibitzing about what might happen next. I'm particularly blessed that if I'm stuck for an idea and nobody else is jumping in, my wife always has a suggestion.<br/><br/>Heh. Now that I think about it, I realize that our group uses <br/><br/>Player: "This.. then this... then this... OK, GM, what happens now?"<br/><br/>as a reward mechanism sometimes! I've had players push to win a conflict and then explictly hand narration of the outcome over to me, because it's a specific situation where they want my input in particular. It's almost like it's something novel. Weird. I think I just realized that our group has internalized distribution of GM power without noticing it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149635">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149635/#Comment_149635" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T09:53:46+00:00" title="June 11, 2008  9:53AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How do I deal with that sort of thing?<br/>First I go, "Shhwwaaaat?"  Then I start nodding my head.<br/><br/>Take, f'rinstance, this, from a game of the Rustbelt:<br/>In the previous session, PC Brown Jenkins, played by Steven, asked the NPC mechanic Mule-Ear Joe where to find the brakeline on a car so that he could cut the brakeline on a car that belonged to a known spy (who didn't know that Jenkins had made her for a spy).  Late in the next session (well after the spy and her contract killer accomplice had been dealt with), Jenkins is being captured at gunpoint by a minor antagonist and his goons.  He decides to stand down, so they're taking him to the car.  Just before they put him in the car, he breaks loose from their grasp, and he rolls under the car.  I'm thinkin, "What is he doing?"  And so is Steven.  He's not even sure why he did that.  Until something clicks and he says, "I cut the brakeline!"<br/>And I go, "Shhwhaaat?"<br/>And he goes, "That is, if it's in the same place as the last one?"<br/>And I go, "It is NOW!"<br/><br/>Then he gives himself up, playing it off like that was just a dumb desperation move, and they eventually run into an intersection because they have no brake fluid left and get hit by a truck.  Jenkins survived the accident, as did one of the thugs, who Jenkins promptly strangled with a seatbelt.  Thanks to the resolution system, all of this was easy to handle, so I just ran with it.<br/><br/>This sort of thing is exactly why I love flexible resolution systems with some degree of abstraction.  Everyone should have one, even if only to fall back on when the less-abstract mechanics don't apply.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149647">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149647/#Comment_149647" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T10:22:05+00:00" title="June 11, 2008 10:22AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: merb101</cite>Some people can play in this manner, some people can't.</blockquote>\nFair enough.
