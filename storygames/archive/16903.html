Keep in mind that this is just the beginning and will be further streamlined.<br/><br/>Combat occurs in abstract rounds (could be six seconds, could be sixty) with attacks and defense handled simultaneously. The exact amount of time is not important, only the rule that each character gets one rolled action per round.<br/><br/>This example is an abstract and there is very little flavor text, the focus is on the mechanics.<br/><br/>Scenario:<br/><br/>Gax is moving through a forbidden forest, hunting an evil wolf that has been terrorizing the village of Orlante. He knows the creature is far more dangerous than a typical wolf. It is a <b><i>wolfen</i></b>, both savage and maleficent. Across a small clearing, the monstrous wolf awaits. The beast is unafraid of the fighter and is ready to attack. Gax pulls his sword and races forward . . .<br/><br/>Combatants:<br/><br/>Title: Gax<br/>Typecast: <i>the Strong</i><br/>Trade: Fighter<br/>Tools: [A Bold Heart] [Mail] [Sword] [Tough as Nails]<br/>Trademarks: [Charge] [Command] [Slash] [Heft]<br/>Trumps: [Always Ready] <br/>Tolls: [Fool\u2019s Rush In]<br/>Threat: 4<br/><br/>Typecast: <i>a monstrous wolf</i><br/>Trade: Wolfen<br/>Tools: [Thick fur] [Intelligent and capable of speech] [Swift and silent] [Sharp, wicked teeth]<br/>Trademarks: [Bite] [Chase] [Howl] [Stalk]<br/>Trumps: [Demonic cunning] [Works together with pack]<br/>Tolls: [Fear of fire] [Vile and corrupt breed]<br/>Threat: 3<br/><br/>Round One:<br/><br/>Gax the Strong gets 3D for [fighter] [sword] [slash] and rolls a 6, 6, 2. Gax gets a 12 (6+6 for highest doubles].<br/><br/>The Wolfen gets 3D for [wolfen] [teeth] [bite] and plays the <b>trump</b> [demonic cunning] which cites: <i>this hellish instinct allows a wolfen to ignore one successful attack from an enemy</i>. Any opposed successful attack is negated for the round. The monstrous wolf rolls a 6, 4, 2 and gets a 6.<br/><br/>Gax wins the round 12 to 6 and in a normal situation would kill the wolfen with this score difference. But since the trump was played, no damage was caused by the fighter. Nice play wolf!<br/><br/>Round Two:<br/><br/>Gax the Strong spends 1 <b>threat</b> point (lowering his score to 3) and gets 4D [fighter] [sword] [slash] + [threat]. He rolls a 5, 5, 5, 1 for a 10 (5+5 for highest doubles) and also gains an extra <b>triumph</b> for the additional 5.<br/><br/>The wolfen also spends a threat point (lowering its score to 2) and gets 4D [wolfen] [teeth] [bite] + [threat]. The beast rolls a 6, 3, 1, 1 for a 6.<br/><br/>Gax hits the monstrous wolf with his sword. He gets one point for a successful attack, another for the margin (1 extra point for every three points difference) and two more for the triumphs. So his total is 4. <br/><br/>The wolfen\u2019s hide will soak 1 point. It takes another for the trouble <b>Hurt</b>. The rest must come off of its threat score. The wolfen gambled and lost. It\u2019s threat score is reduced to zero and the beast is dead.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_385186">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385186/#Comment_385186" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-15T15:52:16+00:00" title="July 15, 2012  3:52PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mechanical ok<br/><br/>Where are the descriptions, and how do they tie into the mechanics?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_385205">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vgunn" title="vgunn"><img alt="vgunn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vgunn">vgunn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385205/#Comment_385205" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-16T00:25:25+00:00" title="July 16, 2012 12:25AM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Descriptions will come on the pre-gen tear sheets and also with specific examples, so if you are building a character you'll have some to go on.

I glossed over this just to get straight into to the fight. Yep, Gax is going to have a real hard time controlling himself in this situation and a number of factors could come into play (mostly negative). Foe example, the toll takes affect and he barrels across the meadow, "For Orlante!." He'll use his [Charge] which will cause [Doubt] on a successful attack beyond any damage the beast takes (or something like that).  But the wolfen [Howls] and plays the trump [Works with a pack]. Three more wolfen appear slavering with anticipation. Without going into further details, it looks like Gax's toll will pay with his life.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_385259">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385259/#Comment_385259" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-16T19:50:43+00:00" title="July 16, 2012  7:50PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Does the winner get narrative control for that round?
