It's one of the most immersive and interesting CRPGs I've played. The basic premise is you're a high school student (male in the original, male or female in the PSP re-release) in a small town that has some strange goings on. The strange goings on is that at midnight, there's an extra hour, wherein most people turn into coffins, but a few people are sensitive and remain awake. They usually get killed by the monsters who come out at this time, but a few people have the capacity to evoke a 'Persona', which gives them extra capability to deal with these monsters. Most people only have a single one, but the main character has multiple Personas.<br/><br/>What makes it interesting isn't actually the Persona and extra hour bit, but the time management. Each day begins with you going to school, choosing whether you pay attention in class or doze off, you interact with fellow students at break times, and after school you either train with an extracurricular club you joined or go off and interact with other people around the town. The unusual bit here is once you've committed to interact with someone, you don't do anything else, it takes up a good chunk of your time, and there's no way to do everything (unless you do a series of NewGame+). The really interesting bit is your personal connections with various people strengthen the power of your Personas. So rather than leveling up by grinding, you're leveling up by interacting with others, opening up to them and getting them to open up to you.<br/><br/>As the story progresses, various things happen. You've got traditional Japanese festivals, you've got a ghost story investigation going on - all things that are part of the main plot regardless. You also have various subplots cropping up based on whom you have personal interactions with (I'm being intentionally vague here, it's a great story, I don't want to spoil it for anyone who's intrigued).<br/><br/>There are also some neat aspects of gaming the system, but again it's well balanced. If you want to increase your courage, you actually try to get a bit sick, see the doctor who's a bit nuts and gives you a horrible concoction (you need courage to drink it), so actually getting sick is an advantage. Alternately you can make sure you're in better health by regularly going to the bathroom, which isn't necessary, but if you take the extra effort to immerse yourself then you get some bonuses in a different way. Really the only right way to do it though is make sure you develop those personal connections - without them, you are nothing.<br/><br/>So Persona 3 has a lot of elements, it has been detailed pretty well in each one of them, and it works very well. I'm thinking some of the ideas could be quite interesting in a tabletop game. So for those of you who have played it, and also those who are intrigued by what I've described above, what are some implementations in a tabletop setting that could get similar stuff going?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_326989">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326989/#Comment_326989" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-30T22:51:42+00:00" title="May 30, 2011 10:51PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like Bliss Stage.

So I find this topic rather interesting, and I enjoyed Persona 3 quite a great deal. Unfortunately I'm rather tired at the moment, so my insights won't be particularly helpful. There are a few things that I think are rather key if one were to bring Persona to the Tabletop scene.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Rewarding relationships between PCs and others PCs (likely at the expense of other relationships, causing a bit of tension. We both know one has to miss special dates at times..although if you are smart you can avoid it)<br/>\n- Similarly rewarding relationships between Npcs and other PCs (suppose this could be on separate scales..like at the end of a session you could ask who have you grown closer to or who you do you know better akin to AW)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Character Creation could be interesting. You could potentially have a number of preset choices.. about the character's background mixed with questions about their general psyche. Based on this you could choose their Persona. And when the character reaches a critical stage in their development the persona might develop as well (this would be up to the GM/ST/IGOR).<br/>\n<br/>\n-Obviously you could just have the MC use their best discretion but then you might get players going "WTF , why do I get Maru  while Sara gets Cybele?" .<br/>\n<br/>\n-I could see implementing the Velvet Room as a coy way to avoid awkward moments when you want to ask the player "Wait a minute.." or some such. The Velvet Room could be a tool at the disposal of the Gamemaster.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther thoughts...completely mess with the relationships when the start to get developed <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/>  Jealousy, nightmarish Dali realms pop up more often, unforeseen things coming back to bite you in the ass.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could always have players also start by picking a card out from a deck... to determine if they are say Tower or whatever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_327010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327010/#Comment_327010" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-31T05:38:53+00:00" title="May 31, 2011  5:38AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The idea I have for Persona (and time management) is this:<br><br>-All players create a twitter account and follow each other, including the World player.<br>-Each day between sessions, players can arrange with each other up to three times a day to do possible activities - lunch time, afternoon and evening.<br>-The World will use a random generator to determine which, if any, NPCs want to hang out, too.<br>-Manage your time, including slots for studying and part time jobs.<br>-The World will also remind you of upcoming festivals and such.

In Persona 3 and P4 the link between your friends and your Personae is one-way (strengthening your emotional bonds strengthens your powers, but harm to a Persona never blows back into the "real world"), while Bliss Stage makes the link two-way, but I think that might add some interesting texture without distorting the feel of the source material too much.<br><br>I love me some Shin Megami Tensei, but hadn't given serious thought to tabletopping it-- Sorceror SOUNDS right, but having a stable of multiple demons is probably more of a net hindrance than a gain, and Megaten is all about using summoning to solve problems instead of causing more (Sorceror actually is a bizarrely apt choice for many anime/manga-style "special powers" series, though usually that means modeling their powers as Possessor demons and making the Price and Telltale as metaphorical "inner demons") .<br/><br/>You could also probably fold Nobilis into something approximating the right shape, but then I'm actually having a hard time not thinking of things in terms of Nobilis 3 lately (like, the Thor movie actually works pretty well).  Just go with Bliss Stage.  Unfortunately, I'm not sure it's currently available, though a new version is coming out from the Cel*Style posse sometime.

Lore is pretty sweet, and it would be great to have some cards and work with them, especially combining them to make new personas (Yugioh cards maybe?), but there's definitely room for switching things around to accommodate group play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_327773">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/framweard" title="framweard"><img alt="framweard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/framweard">framweard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327773/#Comment_327773" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-04T15:06:09+00:00" title="June  4, 2011  3:06PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ooh, Devil Survivor.
