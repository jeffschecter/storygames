Well, "ran" is maybe a bit strong of a word, since it's GMless -- "hosted", maybe?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, players were Danielle Lewon, Paul Czege, Sandy Smith-Casey (my wife), and me.  We started off with choosing setting.  Sandy and I left it up to Danielle and Paul, who decided on an unspecified future time on a space station.  Next was character creation; one of the unusual bits of ACNS is that everyone makes two characters.<br/>\n<br/>\nDanielle created Seth, a somewhat urbane vampire with the ability to walk through walls; and Sister Mary, an old nun.  Paul made Tim, a child-vampire with power over rats and rat-like features; and The Bright Defender, a wannabe superhero.  Sandy created Cavy, a bartender of not-determined sex; and Corrina, a cleaning woman.  I made a doctor (whose name I forget -- he didn't wind up used in play); and Jerome, a high school student.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the characters made, Danielle decided to start off Sister Mary, Paul chose The Bright Defender, and Sandy chose Corrina.  I chose not to pick a character for the first chapter, instead taking the option to swap among different "minor" characters.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext step was establishing potential relationships.  Sandy and I have had a lot of fun with this in the past, and from after comments, Paul and Danielle liked it as well.  In ACNS, the players on each end of a relationship each pick what that relationship could be.  We started off with relationships among the major characters for the first chapter (i.e., the ones that people had picked to play):<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Bright Defender (is protective of)/(loves) Corrina.<br/>\nCorrina (is inspired by)/(is scared by) the Bright Defender.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Bright Defender (respects)/(ignores) Sister Mary.<br/>\nSister Mary (feels protected by)/(knows the secret identity of) the Bright Defender.<br/>\n<br/>\nCorinna (idolizes)/(thinks is smart) Sister Mary.<br/>\nSister Mary (feels motherly to)/(is best friends with) Corrina.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210593">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/efindel" title="efindel"><img alt="efindel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/efindel">efindel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210593/#Comment_210593" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-05T13:25:45+00:00" title="June  5, 2009  1:25PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (continued)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Chapter One, the main focus was the relationships among those three characters.  Sister Mary and Corrina bonded a bit over a newly-christened baby, the Bright Defender rescued Sister Mary's kitten from a tree.  Things came around to me, and I chose to play Jerome, in a scene with Sister Mary, creating a new possible relationship pair:<br/>\n<br/>\nJerome (sees as an authority figure)/(sees as a scary nun woman) Sister Mary.<br/>\n<br/>\nCorrina and Sister Mary then had a couple of scenes -- two in a row together, since Paul and I both had to leave the table for a few minutes.  After we returned, Sandy set up a hilarious scene where Corrina was trying to get the Bright Defender to notice her by trying to stick her kitten in a tree, since she'd heard about him rescuing Sister Mary's kitten.  Sister Mary and the Bright Defender then had a scene together, discussing the truancy problem at the school.  The Bright Defender then had a scene with Seth, finally bringing one of the vampires in.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeth had been randomly chosen as the "principal vampire" at the start.  Danielle saw that on his sheet and momentarily thought he was supposed to be the principal of the school -- which we all decided was a great idea.  New relationship pair was established:<br/>\n<br/>\nSeth (thinks of as a partner)/(thinks of as lunch) the Bright Defender.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, the Bright Defender discussed the truancy problem with Seth, having no idea Seth was a vampire.  The two sides' successes cancelled out there, so no actual relationship movement happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nThings came back to me, and I decided to play Tim in a scene with the bartender, Cavy.  Paul had put down as one of the way that Tim established control over others "eating rotten fruit", and also that Tim's "yellow eyes" were one of the things that revealed him to be a vampire.  So, Cavy found Tim in the back room of the bar, talking about how hungry he was while eating a piece of rotten fruit, and looking at Cavy with those strange yellow eyes.  New relationship pair:<br/>\n<br/>\nCavy (obeys)/(is creeped out by) Tim.<br/>\n<br/>\nI won that one, and pushed forward "obeys", with the scene closing with Cavy picking up some food and approaching Tim with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe next scene was Sister Mary and Corrina again, with Sister Mary seeing Corrina with Corrina's kitten, but thinking it was her kitten.  She tried to take the kitten from Corrina, with fun results stemming from Corrina's "speaks no known language" weakness. The scene pushed forward the "feels motherly to" enough to cement the relationship... and thereby end the chapter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_210596">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210596/#Comment_210596" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-05T13:36:19+00:00" title="June  5, 2009  1:36PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: efindel</cite>We started off with choosing setting.

Sandy picked up Cavy, Danielle took Seth, I took Jerome, and Paul chose to not pick a major, after seeing all the shuffling I'd gotten to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was getting late at this point, so Chapter Two is both a bit more hazy for me, and we didn't get to finish it.  Highlights included:<br/>\n<br/>\nSister Mary coming to Jerome's defense, saving him from some bullies, and cementing the "sees as an authority figure" relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\nTim finding Cavy on her way home from the bar, summoning up rats, eating more rotten fruit... and taking away her last point of Will, making her dominated by him.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeth allowing The Bright Defender to find him menacing a girl, then controlling the girl to offer herself to The Bright Defender as a reward for joining Seth.<br/>\n<br/>\nSister Mary beginning to figure out The Bright Defender's secret ID.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game broke up with several of us too tired to go on, but everyone seemed to have fun, and some interesting stuff was starting to happen.  We talked about the game for another ten to twenty minutes afterward -- Paul really seemed to like the method of establishing relationships, and how it drove goals -- that was the most talked-about bit.  Both Paul and Danielle seemed to like the "everyone creates two characters" part of things, and the ability to change characters in the course of play.<br/>\n<br/>\nI gave Paul and Danielle a copy of the rules and most of the character sheets to keep -- which means I'm relying on my very fallible memory for most of this recounting.

I assume the rules specify (only implicitly, perhaps) that the setting needs to have vampires, at the least, right?<br><br>The short version of the rules that I had with me doesn't say anything about setting creation.  My current draft says:\n<blockquote>First, the players should agree on the setting of the game, and what optional rules they wish to use.  The setting answers the questions "where", "when", and "who" for the "here and now" of the story, and possibly for flashbacks.  They may also want to discuss what kinds of characters they want to play.  No real details are needed at this point, just general ideas.</blockquote>\n... and then provides two examples.  The need for vampires isn't stated, but is implicit.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>Can a player create relationships between her own two characters? Is there an advantage or disadvantage to doing this?</blockquote>\nYou can only "own" one character at a time -- the "minor" characters who are not "owned" can change hands many times in the course of play.  The rules do specify that, if possible, you have to create your initial two relationships to other "major" (i.e., owned) characters.  Thus, in the situation in this playtest, with three major characters, each had to create a relationship to each of the other major characters.<br><br>Later on, when its your turn to frame a scene, you could frame a scene with the character you're playing and the other character you created.  However, that other character would be played by someone else for that scene.<br><br>There can be advantages -- for one, you could "craft" a character to be vulnerable in a particular way, and the other character to take advantage of that vulnerability -- e.g., making one character a beautiful redhead, and giving the other a weakness for redheads.  This could make it easy to cement a relationship, which you could later use to "call on" that character in conflicts, getting extra dice from them.  <br><br>This is intended to be part of the strategy of the game, particularly for victims, who are weak compared to vampires.  My basis for including it is Lucy's three suitors in <i>Dracula</i> and, even more, Dracula's three "brides".  Some of these characters seem to exist in the story purely to bolster other characters, allowing them to indirectly do things they can't do directly.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>Can a player create two mortal or two vampire characters? Is there an advantage or disadvantage to doing this?</blockquote>\nYou can do either.  Vampires are stronger than Victims, so a Vampire-heavy game is likely to be shorter -- the Victims really need to help each other out to "win".<br><br>I should note, though, that the game doesn't have any "victory conditions".  There are suggested "end conditions" -- e.g., when there are no vampires left in play, or when no vampire has an unsatisfied goal -- but since character ownership is fluid, these are more suggestions for "a good time to end the story" than anything else.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210606">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/efindel" title="efindel"><img alt="efindel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/efindel">efindel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210606/#Comment_210606" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-05T13:59:53+00:00" title="June  5, 2009  1:59PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite><cite>Posted By: efindel</cite>I chose not to pick a character for the first chapter, instead taking the option to swap among different "minor" characters.</blockquote>\nIiiiiiinteresting.

I am making up the numbers, Keywords, and Weaknesses -- I may actually be right on some of them, but I wouldn't count on it.<br><br>The scene started with Danielle, playing Seth as her major, framing it.  She decided that she wanted The Bright Defender as the other character in the scene, and that the scene was taking place after dark, out in the open.  Seth was waiting to spot The Bright Defender on patrol, and when he did, visibly accosted a young woman.  (The young woman wasn't a created character, and thus, had no stats of her own -- she was simply a bit of narrative color allowing Seth to use his abilities.)<br><br>Danielle had already established Seth's chapter goal as "dominating" The Bright Defender.  To do this, she needed to reduce The Bright Defender's Will to zero, from its starting value of three.  This establishes the "stakes" of the scene as Mental, meaning that the vampiric traits of Beast and Mastery can be affected, and the victim traits of Prowess and Will.  Vampires' Darkness and victims' Innocence are off-limits without raising the stakes.<br><br>Things start with open narration, each side saying what they're doing.  Seth started a "join me" sort of speech, drawing on his Mastery.  Danielle chose not to use all of Seth's Mastery, however, as each point of a vampiric trait used raises the corresponding Need, and bad things start to happen if Needs get too high.  She also used Seth's Keywords of "Possession" -- by speaking through the girl, offering her to The Bright Defender -- and "Charming".  She also used one of The Bright Defender's Weaknesses, "respects authority figures".  Each point of Mastery used gave her a die to roll, as did each Keyword or opponent's Weakness.  Using five points of Mastery (and thereby raising Mastery's Need, Desire, by five points) along with those two Keywords and one Weakness gave her eight dice.<br><br>On the other side, The Bright Defender stepped forward and tried to pull the girl away from Seth, gaining dice from his "Prowess" of four.  He also used his "protects the innocent" Keyword for another die, and his "does the right thing" Keyword for another, giving six dice.  Looking at Seth's weaknesses, he didn't find one he wanted to use.  He <i>could</i> have chosen to use Seth's Mastery Weakness of "Virgins", but chose not to have The Bright Defender be a virgin.<br><br>They rolled, eight dice versus six -- even numbers are failures, odds are successes.  Danielle rolled two more successes than Paul.  Paul could use his successes to cancel Danielle's, but that would still leave her two which she could apply to his Will -- which would be enough to take it to zero.<br><br>Now, at this point, Paul had two options.  He could have stopped there and burned Vitality points to protect his Will, preventing Danielle from taking him to zero.  With a Will of only two and only two Vitality, though, that would have left him with only one Will and one Vitality -- a bad position for future scenes.  So instead, he chose to take the second option, and Raise Stakes.<br><br>The Stakes were raised from Mental to Spiritual, meaning that Darkness and Innocence could now be affected.  Each side kept the successes they already had, and a new round of narration began.  Among the limits of raising stakes is that you can't use what you've already used in the scene again -- so Danielle used Seth's Darkness instead of Mastery, calling on supernatural abilities, and Paul used The Bright Defender's Will instead of Prowess.  Seth didn't find any new Keywords or Weaknesses to use, but Paul decided that The Bright Defender was beginning to realize that Seth was something other than human, and called on a couple of Seth's Weaknesses -- I remember Seth having one that revealed he was a vampire, but I don't remember what it was.  <br><br>Dice were rolled again.  This time, luck was on Paul's side.  Danielle gained no new successes, but Paul gained four, giving him two more successes than Danielle had.  He cancelled all of Danielle's successes, then used his two remaining ones to decrease Seth's Mastery.  End of scene narration went to Paul, as the only one actually spending successes, and he narrated The Bright Defender managing to wrest the girl away from Seth and fly away, carrying her off to safety.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_210622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/efindel" title="efindel"><img alt="efindel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/efindel">efindel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210622/#Comment_210622" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-05T14:43:18+00:00" title="June  5, 2009  2:43PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 5, 2009 2:45PM by efindel.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>I'm just full of questions today.

In an end-of-chapter conflict, the loser of the initial contest can't escalate normally, but can "escalate" down the chain by choosing to accept Consequences.  It's probably easiest to explain this with an example:<br/><br/>Let's say that a vampire named Arthur is trying to dominate a victim named Katie.  In the course of the chapter, Arthur has brought Katie's Innocence down to zero.  This triggers an End of Chapter conflict, where we decide whether Arthur really manages to dominate Katie, or she somehow escapes that fate (either way, though, the Chapter will end).<br/><br/>The contest is rolled, and Katie's player loses.  Since this is an end-of-chapter conflict, Katie can't escalate normally.  What she can do is get another try by taking a Consequence; the Consequences available are (a) the consequences of losing a lower conflict and (b) "escaping out", which having the character escape but removing them from the pool of characters in the game.<br/><br/>Thus, Katie's player can escalate to Physical for this, specifying whether Katie will either die instead of being dominated (the consequences of losing a Physical end of chapter, for a victim), or will "escape out" and exit the story.<br/><br/>At least, that's the current terminology.  I might do better to use different terms for the end-of-chapter loser thing....                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210938">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/efindel" title="efindel"><img alt="efindel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/efindel">efindel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210938/#Comment_210938" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-08T12:06:15+00:00" title="June  8, 2009 12:06PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>Man, you should have told me any of that at Nerdly!

The games Sandy and I have played have run more than eight chapters each, taking about four hours to play with just two players.  I'm not really sure how long the game will wind up taking with more at this point.<br/><br/>Mechanically, the only way that vampires can feed is from humans -- you're not allowed to feed from other vampires, although you can kill them, dominate them, or destroy them.  Since a vampire gains points in a Need any time they use any of their traits, a vampire who does anything has their Needs increasing, and will eventually need to Feed.\n<blockquote>When you're explaining the game to someone to sell it to them, you need to be laser-focused on what the game is about.

So let's craft your marketing spiel.<br/><br/>What experience do you think the game BEST delivers?</blockquote>\nI had to think about this a while, which is a sign that it's a really good question I need to answer.  :-)<br/><br/>I originally meant for ACNS to handle two types of games -- what I think of as Dracula-like and Twilight-like.  The Dracula-like ones are traditional horror fare, where a monster comes along and makes trouble for a group of people.  The Twilight-like ones are well, essentially relationship dramas with vampires.<br/><br/>In both cases, what it's really handling is relationships, and I think that's what it's best at.  I know that's what Paul and Danielle were enjoying, and it's what Sandy and I have enjoyed in our playtests.<br/><br/>So, the experience it best delivers is, well, relationship drama -- a struggle to see how the relationship(s) between two or more people are going to turn out.\n<blockquote>Also, if your game isn't delivering your core experience right off the bat, you may not have a game that plays well for one-shots or con games, and that could hurt you in the long run. Is there a way to accelerate play to the point you're talking about?

I think part of the problem is that the vampires are superfluous to what it does best right now.  You can have relationship drama either with a vampire or without one.<br/><br/>I'm not sure that this is 100% bad -- some of the stories I'm trying to model barely have the vampires making any "on-screen" appearances at all.  In <i>Dracula</i>, for example, we see the Count a lot in the first part of the book, but for the majority of the book, he's off-stage, motivating the actions of the rest of the cast without directly interacting with them.<br/><br/>I'm realizing now that in the course of paring rules down, I lost one that I had originally, and which could have helped at the Nerdly game -- that a "principal" character always has a goal, even if they aren't a major character.  If I'd still had that rule in and used it, Seth would have had a goal determined before anyone picked him up, and that could well have changed how the first chapter went.<br/><br/>I'm going to think about this a bit.<br/><br/>Oh -- and in case I haven't said it enough, thanks!

Our group's recent games of Grey Ranks, and Thy Vernal Chieftains playtesting have been a bit workshoppy. But the goals on the relationships in And Cast No Shadow very naturally gave creative direction when we were framing scenes. It wasn't workshoppy at all. Lots of games have relationship mechanics that give bonus dice when a player uses a relationship, and then maybe the relationship must play an important factor in the fiction, but I've not played another game where a relationship map made scene creation feel as creatively natural and organic.<br/><br/>So yeah, I can see how you might be wanting to pitch And Cast No Shadow's value proposition from the relationship mechanics. They're awful fun.<br/><br/>But something else I appreciated quite a bit was the structure of character ownership. I loved the Bright Defender, and I could have continued playing him if I wanted. No one could take him from me unless I put him back into the pool, right? But to keep playing him would mean forgoing playing any of the other characters. There's a lot of fun in that. Seeing other characters in the spotlight gives me affection for them, and ideas for them. I have to decide if I'm prepared to give up my current character for the opportunity of doing something with a different character I've been thinking about. Or alternately, maybe I just want some creative breathing room, and so I play the field a bit. This all seemed very nicely organized by the game.<br/><br/>So anyway, I like these things from having played, and I think also the game probably does the other things you say, creating a progression of fiction that emulates Dracula and whatnot, but Adam is right, you need to narrow in on a sales pitch. You also mentioned the game has some emergent properties when the vampires have to start feeding. Tell me about how the game changes when that happens.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_212552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/efindel" title="efindel"><img alt="efindel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/efindel">efindel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212552/#Comment_212552" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-16T06:34:22+00:00" title="June 16, 2009  6:34AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul Czege</cite>The way you have the two sides of the relationships in the relationship map clashing over how the relationship will be defined was really productive of fun gameplay, and creatively productive for me personally.

Lots of games have relationship mechanics that give bonus dice when a player uses a relationship, and then maybe the relationship must play an important factor in the fiction, but I've not played another game where a relationship map made scene creation feel as creatively natural and organic.<br/><br/>So yeah, I can see how you might be wanting to pitch And Cast No Shadow's value proposition from the relationship mechanics. They're awful fun.<br/><br/>But something else I appreciated quite a bit was the structure of character ownership. I loved the Bright Defender, and I could have continued playing him if I wanted. No one could take him from me unless I put him back into the pool, right? But to keep playing him would mean forgoing playing any of the other characters. There's a lot of fun in that. Seeing other characters in the spotlight gives me affection for them, and ideas for them. I have to decide if I'm prepared to give up my current character for the opportunity of doing something with a different character I've been thinking about. Or alternately, maybe I just want some creative breathing room, and so I play the field a bit. This all seemed very nicely organized by the game.</blockquote>\nHi, Paul!  Thanks for jumping in!  <br/><br/>You're right, no one could take The Bright Defender from you to play themselves unless you put him back in the pool.  (They could possibly kill him through the game mechanics, but that wouldn't let them play him....)<br/><br/>The odd thing is that the relationship rules are actually the last thing I added to the game, but in play, they've come to the forefront as what really drives things.  I think I need to get some more actual play in to get a better handle on them.  That may be fun right now, since we've got Sandy's son for the summer, but I'll work it out one way or another.\n<blockquote>So anyway, I like these things from having played, and I think also the game probably does the other things you say, creating a progression of fiction that emulates Dracula and whatnot, but Adam is right, you need to narrow in on a sales pitch. You also mentioned the game has some emergent properties when the vampires have to start feeding. Tell me about how the game changes when that happens.</blockquote>\nWell, not just feeding, but when they start to become active, working on killing/dominating/turning major characters.  This is where the relationship-building is supposed to start to pay off.  One-on-one, vampires tend to always beat victims, since they have a lot more points to put into their traits.  To have a real hope against a vampire, a victim needs to get help from another victim.  To do that, you "call on" the other victim, using their relationship to you to bring them into the scene.  Once they're in the scene, they can contribute dice as well, from their traits and keywords.<br/><br/>Vampires can also "call on" others, but since they have other goals available, they haven't tended to build a lot of relationships in the past.  (There's nothing that prevents them from doing so, however, and in some setups, it could become very useful.  E.g., an all-vampire or mostly-vampire game.)<br/><br/>Hmm.  I think to some extent, a large part of the problem is that I haven't gotten to play the game enough yet.  I'm thinking I'm going to look for some Internet whiteboarding tools, and see if I can get some people to help me playtest it online.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_212564">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212564/#Comment_212564" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-16T06:57:34+00:00" title="June 16, 2009  6:57AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Travis,\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: efindel</cite>To do that, you "call on" the other victim, using their relationship to you to bring them into the scene.

One player has a Victim and one has a Vampire? What player did what to have the scene happen? The Vampire called for a scene with a Victim? Then what does the Victim player have to do, mechanically, to bring in the helper Victim? Is there a dice roll? And what do you mean by "can contribute dice"? Is it voluntary?

The scene could have been started by either player, in the normal course of going around starting scenes.<br/><br/>To bring in a helper, you "call on" that character. To do this, the "called on" character has to have a relationship to your character.  If the called on character is not currently being played, or the character's player agrees to enter the scene, then no dice roll is needed.  If the character is being played and the player doesn't wish to enter the scene, then there is a dice roll, of Will vs. Will.<br/><br/>Once in the scene, if the character called on has a player, that player rolls dice for the character and spends them.  If the character does not have a player, the player who called on that character rolls the dice for that character and spends them.<br/><br/>Edit:  Blah, too much happening this morning...<br/><br/>The limit of how many dice the "called on" character can contribute is the strength of their relationship to you.  Thus, if the relationship is only at 3, they can only contribute a maximum of three dice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_212602">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212602/#Comment_212602" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-16T08:34:58+00:00" title="June 16, 2009  8:34AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Refresh my memory.

A relationship alternative that reaches strength 5 is "cemented".  If cementing that relationship was a chapter goal, that triggers an end of chapter.  Regardless, a cemented relationship can't be touched until the next end of chapter (the remainder of the current chapter, if it didn't end the chapter, or all of the next chapter, if it did end the chapter).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_212702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212702/#Comment_212702" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-16T14:25:40+00:00" title="June 16, 2009  2:25PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I remember being a bit confused by the diagram we had of relationship arrows where there'd be one from my character to another character, and a separate arrow back from that character to my character. I totally understood how the descriptors on the arrows worked. In a scene I was working to establish that the relationship was characterized by the descriptor I wanted for it. But I was never sure how it mattered which arrow it was on. But okay, over scenes in several sessions I and the other players have established a four dice relationship of "Floyd underestimates me" between my current character and Floyd the Victim. Which direction does that arrow point in the diagram? And when I'm being menaced by a vampire, and I've called Floyd into the scene, is it the number of dice on "Floyd underestimates me" that is the limit on what he can aid with, or the number of dice on the other arrow between me and him?<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
