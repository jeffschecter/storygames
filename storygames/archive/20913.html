Everybody in the band is a skilled musical talent, all of them may sing, and they all have to work together to make the wonderful happen.  But the frontman has an additional role: somehow they embody the band's image as a whole; usually they're not just the lead singer but the lyricist as well, which means they also represent what the band's songs are "about".  I've been in a number of bands, and I've never seen any argument over who the frontman was.  When you have one, it's quite clear.  I've also been in bands where everyone knew there was no frontman.  That is also quite clear.  The only disagreement that might arise is when you have a *bad* frontman who thinks they're *good*.<br/><br/>Thoughts?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458928">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458928/#Comment_458928" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-31T05:32:40+00:00" title="December 31, 2016  5:32AM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            PS to Andy the DM, I'm lookin' at you.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458930/#Comment_458930" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-31T09:10:59+00:00" title="December 31, 2016  9:10AM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 31, 2016 9:23AM by Rickard.">edited December 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Suppose we compare the "Why are you GM" question to the question: "Why are you the frontman of the band?"</blockquote>\n"You guys are working together on this to create an adventure", as the game master says in the video after 32 seconds.<br/><br/>I think there is a huge problem with your analogy, namely that the game master is someone who is in a position over everyone else.

Even the game master thinks it's "me and they" when he thinks about him and the rest of the guys.

Or maybe somebody's doing that and I don't know - I don't follow much web media, when all's said and done. It just feels like every time I see something like this it's about people who are either first-timers or utterly mediocre players putting D&amp;D through its most-tired paces. It's like if media consistently depicted the art form of dancing by filming high school promenade dances.<br/><br/>(This is not helped by the geek media tendency of focusing on the foibles of roleplaying in rpg narratives - stories about roleplayers tend to be comedies about how difficult and frustrating it is, and how weird the people doing it are. If roleplaying was only as good as it's depicted to be in these works, I wouldn't even do it.)<br/><br/>If there were more high-quality depictions of roleplaying out there in consumer formats, who knows, the hobby might even benefit by having inspiring examples. My understanding is that other art forms benefit from having public, emblematic master-pieces that people study and aspire towards in their own practice. Meanwhile, the best single example that a roleplayer can work towards is apparently the <i>Knights of the Dinner Table</i> (and I'm not even kidding, that's about the only story about rpgs that I remember off the top of my head with even moments of high quality play, in between the comedy).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458942">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458942/#Comment_458942" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-01T07:09:14+00:00" title="January  1, 2017  7:09AM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 1, 2017 7:10AM by AsIf.">edited January 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            While it's not really the epitome of roleplaying or gamemastering as an artform, I think Dan Harmon's "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HarmonQuest" rel="nofollow">HarmonQuest</a>" presents the game in a way that is vastly more entertaining than the typical D&amp;D-related piece.

Brief commercial success meant that it was difficult to distinguish the image of roleplaying and what was actually happening. We\u2019re now in the more-or-less postmodern era of roleplay in which it is impossible to distinguish between its reality and its representation.*<br/><br/>Any debate of this order very quickly becomes a bunch of people wilfully misunderstanding one another: terms are so cheapened by misuse and repetition that they have little practical use.

However: it is not a story about roleplaying, but merely an epic fantasy story with a D&amp;D comedy sideline. Stories like this <i>do</i> exist, ones that have a grounding in rpgs, but use that foundation as just a jumping-off point. <i>Dragonlance</i> novels already did this 30 years ago, and they're no worse than similar paperback stuff with no rpg connection. They never tell us about the people playing the game, what they do to succeed in the act of play, and so on. In fact, they're not stories about roleplaying, except with the most vague implication that "maybe you might produce something like this if you played a roleplaying game, but I'm not going to describe the actual process for you here, because this is just a story".<br/><br/>I mean, let's compare <a href="http://www.giantitp.com/Comics.html" rel="nofollow">Order of the Stick</a> with a more recent type of gaming comic, exemplified by <a href="http://friendshipisdragons.com/" rel="nofollow">Friendship is Dragons</a>; the latter is actually an explicit story about roleplaying (well, it's a postmodern satire remix of D&amp;D and the My Little Pony cartoon), so we can judge it as such: there are players, a specific rules set (D&amp;D 4th edition), and an on-going story about how these people play, scene by scene, procedures and all, why they play the way they do, and what they accomplish in artistic terms with their play. As one might expect from my complaining about this, the process of play the latter comic illustrates for us is, to put it kindly, mediocre; I haven't played that badly in 15 years (barring the occasional off-day, I suppose), and here a writer depicts this as a normalized picture of what roleplaying is like. Again, if roleplaying was that sort of clumsy mommy-may-I railroad storytelling, I doubt I'd engage with it. I actually know I wouldn't, from my own play history <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>(I should note that I do get that <i>Friendship is Dragons</i> has a lot of stuff going on that makes for good reasons for why the comic depicts roleplaying the way it does - depicting roleplaying is something like fourth-important thing in that creative gestalt, I think. Still, whatever the reason, the outcome is that it joins a hundred other media depictions of roleplaying that I think many roleplayers will find at most mildly amusing, but not particularly ideal as models to aspire towards.)<br/><br/>The more I think about this, the more I think that I might just have an unrealistic expectation of what kind of roleplaying people who write gaming stories engage in. It's not actually at all incredible that there's a large number of gamers out there for whom the OP video or <i>Friendship is Dragons</i> are pretty much realistic descriptions of how they play. From this viewpoint it might not be the case that they're willfully caricatyric; maybe it's just an effort at realism.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458970">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458970/#Comment_458970" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-03T16:02:44+00:00" title="January  3, 2017  4:02PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>If there were more high-quality depictions of roleplaying out there in consumer formats, who knows, the hobby might even benefit by having inspiring examples. My understanding is that other art forms benefit from having public, emblematic master-pieces that people study and aspire towards in their own practice. Meanwhile, the best single example that a roleplayer can work towards is apparently the <i>Knights of the Dinner Table</i> (and I'm not even kidding, that's about the only story about rpgs that I remember off the top of my head with even moments of high quality play, in between the comedy).</blockquote>\nWhat sort of "consumer format" are we talking about here?  Roll20 is doing some good work with streamed games that are at least as good as any game I've ever produced (Note: I have absolutely no idea where my games stand on other people's standards of quality).
