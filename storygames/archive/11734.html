Is that a jargon term?<br/><br/>Stereotypes <b>as I understand the term</b> are by their nature bad.  Because it means you impose a generalization on a person regardless of whether it fits or not.  Often they aren't based on any accurate generalizations at all.  "He's black, so he's got rhythm" is an example.  "He's a Jew, of course he's greedy" is another.  Now, accurate generalizations can be made about groups--you could say something like "conservatives in the U.S.A. tend to oppose abortion" and have a generalization about conservatives that's accurate.  But if you then meet someone you identify as a conservative and think (or say), "he's a conservative, he must be against abortion," you're imposing the generalization on the individual, which is stereotyping.<br/><br/>As a side note:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Logos7</cite>That we have some kind of imperative to break convention?

After brainstorming archetypes / stereotypes to base the characters on, you intentionally subvert them.  Like, if I'm the the gung-ho Latina space marine played by Michelle Rodriguez, then I decide to subvert that by stereotype by having her be from a wealthy business family and applying to law school on the side while taking night classes.  I think that's a pretty good way to do it, because it makes you aware of the stereotypes, but it still limits the possibilities and encourages you to think in stereotypical fashion in the first place. Now, if you're really trying to emulate survival horror, most of them are pretty grounded in stock characters, so you may be okay with that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261924">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261924/#Comment_261924" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-14T12:58:10+00:00" title="March 14, 2010 12:58PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            THanks for telling me to go away forever,<br/><br/>go burn in hell<br/><br/>I'm really just asking the same question as everyone else in this thread. I really do think that Archtypes and Sterotypes are practically the same thing, but if you want the disposition (and thats kind a rhetorical offer, I dont really care what you want, Im gonna speak anyway) it goes something like this. <br/><br/>Archtypes are kinda like Big Daddy Memes. These are memes that have gotten so much momentum that they have become pseudo universal. They don't just apply to myth, but are often used in the context of any story (gygax used to talk a lot about archetypes somewhere). Archetypes can apply to people (probably the imaginary person you start off with in the thought about a firefighter is an archtype) but they dont have to. If you want to go all jungian they are surposed to be universal psychic dispostions. They can also apply to stories I'm pretty sure (Its all been written before, is just saying ,that there are no archtypes). <br/><br/>Sterotypes should only apply to people or social groups, and are preheld views that may or may not be based on evidence. Its great to go 'STEROTYPES ARE BAD' except that in a lot of cases, Sterotypes are A&gt; Factual (its only a preheld view, not a necessarily false one) B&gt; Useful. I love how this board has the hugest hardon for Social Currency but don't like its enabler, the sterotype. Sterotype is pretty non fuzzily defined althought it gets a bad wrap sometimes. I surpose the real problem is that Archtype is a lot more fuzzy, and has been used by multible people for quite different things. <br/><br/>As for people having to break the convention of breaking conventions, I think it more or less holds, presuming they are not hypocrits. Its the tolerance problem and overlapping sets problem all over again. These are real problems (and not just silly things people point out for kicks)  that are only held back by the fact that no one actually has the belief to break all beliefs. So why not say what we actually mean (that sterotyping often disadvantages minorities unfairly and we should try not to disadvantage them or that archtypes make archtypical stories and may be lacking in relatible or local content and are boring because of it, or that I've had my fill of them and dont really want anymore)<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm out guys.

If you play it because you think it's funny or clever, it's probably a stereotype. If you play it because you are really excited to explore the depths of the person, it's an archetype. To me.<br/><br/>The actual definition, AFAIK, is that archetypes are the mold\\original, and stereotypes are what comes after. More or less.<br/><br/>Edited to add: (Wow! I had way more to say about this than I thought)<br/><br/>The base of Lafferty, the sort of awkward, repressed innocent I play in our Apocalypse World game, is very similar to a lot of other characters I've played in the past. I enjoy the archetype of the innocent ingenue because life is always pretty rough on roleplaying characters, and I am really, really interested in how events change that sort of character. That is to say, a lot of my characters start out from that same archetype, but they're always wildly different when the game ends. Lafferty, as she is now, is unlike any character I've ever played, and I am super excited to see how being kidnapped by Ba changes her.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261931">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JAR" title="JAR"><img alt="JAR" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JAR">JAR</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261931/#Comment_261931" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-14T14:03:50+00:00" title="March 14, 2010  2:03PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think there may be an even simpler distinction that may be missing here (though if someone meant this more or less, I am willing to believe that I'm just a bit too thick to have picked up on it). As I use the terms, at least, an archetype is a kind of person, whereas a stereotype is a behavior or preference associated with that person. "Scots are humorless and good with money" is a stereotype, but The Wandering Jew is an archetype. Note that the last archetype isn't so very stereotypical, insofar as having traits associated with a particular group; at least in my part of the world, I have never heard it taken as a given that Jews travel ceaselessly.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis may not be the distinction in everyone's usage, but it certainly is in my dialect. As this pertains to roleplaying, I have a number of archetypes that I normally play (oily schemer, blunt craftsperson) but they often have different stereotypes associated with them (a biker, for example, getting high a lot and considering Miller Genuine Draft to be a fancy beer).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261933">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261933/#Comment_261933" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-14T14:15:05+00:00" title="March 14, 2010  2:15PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Archetypes are convenient in fiction. <br/><br/>"This guy is a Hardboiled Detective, got it?

He/she is cast-typed by origin and use in the novel/scenario. The personality is not imbued, but their significance and fate in the story is. For example, Frodo, Aragorn, King Arthur and Harry Potter are all hero archetypes. While their personalities vary greatly, their basic origins and future fates define them as hero. They all have mysterious births, in which their true parents are absent from their raising. They all have a mentor figure who must, as is the archetype of the mentor, die or disappear. The archetype is used to build traditional and meaningful (at times) stories that often follow the coming of age or quest story-line. Hero of a Thousand Faces is a great book on this theme. Love archetypes also are common in these stories, as are female figures who are ordained to be one of three options. While feminist writers have changed this, older novels (classics) generally discuss the female as one of three archetypes. <br/>\n<br/>\nA stereotype is a culturally imbued meaning to a select group of people. It is often based on fear, misunderstanding, or general dislike. And most of these stereotypes are prevalent all over the world. It is often a hateful display of generalizing about another's race, ethnicity, culture, upbringing, socio-economic background, gender or sexuality. A certain personality is imbued upon these individuals based on that stereotype, or personality traits/experiences are expected and assumed to be there. <br/>\n<br/>\nTypically, archetypes don't actually exist. They are story devices and nothing more. And while we want to believe all people are individuals and that we're all snowflakes, stereotypes can and do exist and it's part of the reason stereotypes were formed to begin with. Although the stereotype exists only on the surface, and yes, people do have different personalities than just being a stereotype, the basic premise of the stereotype can exist. <br/>\n<br/>\nI do see a large difference between these two things. In gaming, especially in a fantasy setting, you will see people create heroic characters. With those more interested in epic fantasy, I've had several 'mysterious past, prophecy bound' characters presented to me. This influence to make the great hero is created by reading/watching/interacting with fantasy novels/settings and classic quest story-lines. Lord of the Rings is rife with archetypes. So is Harry Potter. The Once and Future King is another example. I have yet to meet a 'mentor' archetype in reality who had to die/disappear because their student was ready (but didn't feel quite ready, so the mentor had to die/disappear so the hero could step up to the plate). Stereotypes are cultural, imbued, and based on some fraction of a perceived reality. Archetypes are based on story-mythologies and are far older than modern stereotypes.<br/>\n<br/>\n...So that's what I think. This mostly comes from studying culture, literature, social construction and doing a lot of theory reading as that's my favourite nerdling area.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261979">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261979/#Comment_261979" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-15T01:58:07+00:00" title="March 15, 2010  1:58AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like what Kate's saying.<br/><br/>Perhaps it's useful to draw a distinction between kinds of stereotypes.

But hey, I learned something new today.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've written a couple fantasy campaigns that played heavily on archetypes and was, at one point, making a game where players assumed the roles of archetypes and played out the stories how they saw fit. They had guidelines and chose their archetypal moments. For an example, someone playing Gandalf might have chosen to die/disappear in a different way rather than fighting the Balrog. Albeit, I don't know if they could've created a more awesome moment than Tolkien did.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to use them in your game, the question remains how? Is it a game where the characters are meant to be archetypes or are you creating a story that relies heavily on archetypes that doesn't involve the characters?<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the story that doesn't rely on character interaction but can include it, if the players desire, I created an overall story plot that was happening with or without the characters and affected the world around them. They could, of course, meet these archetypes and try to interfere (and had actual impact), but they could also just hear stories and never bother to interfere depending on their chosen paths. To begin with, I would do research. The book I mentioned above is a great resource for plot-lines, the quest and the coming of age novel. If you're looking for more action based, I would pick up more literature on the quest than anything else, as the coming of age story is... well, very done and happens almost automatically in a campaign whether you want it to or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a story that wants players to assume archetypes, well. There are a few ways to go about it. You can either educate your players on archetypes in the very basic sense. "I need someone to play the hero, the earth-mother, the mentor, etc" and give them two or three points to base these characters on. Then generate situations that are archetypal: "Okay, I need someone to be star-crossed lovers with the hero." The players invent their own backgrounds/characters/personality by these archetypes, but have the main foundations of an archetypal story. How they play them out, really, is up to them, but letting them set up scenes, or alter them greatly based on their motivations and what they know must happen at some point would be awesome. I might use cue cards to do this by writing down a few historical traits of each and letting players pick. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou wouldn't even need to tell them that it's based on archetypes. They could simply pick up their background information: "okay, my parents weren't around when I was a kid. Why? Who was I raised by? Do I have a mentor?" And their relationships will start to form based on those historical notes. It's just an idea. I personally enjoy a lot of player control in a setting so that's usually my approach.

Using a stereotype to deal with the concept of a given class of people is useful, especially when you use it as the baseline for discussion and exploration. Using it as the basis of your dealings with an individual member of that class of person is ignorant at best, and actively harmful at worst.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn archetype is an individual, perhaps only conceptually so, that embodies many of the stereotypes of the class. Frequently an archetype will embody the positive stereotypes and either be ambiguous or leave out the negative stereotypes.<br/>\n<br/>\nGamer stereotypes: ultra-fat or ultra-skinny, not too big on personal hygiene, tends toward sarcastic humor, more intelligent than the average person, socially inept, interested in sci-fi or fantasy media, technologically gifted, creative and quirky.<br/>\n<br/>\nGamer archetype: This guy wears a black trenchcoat and has a collection of swords at home. He's always ready with a sub-culture reference or a witty remark. He wears his hair in a pony tail, and has a goatee. He tends to avoid people who aren't into his thing, but he's animated and enthusiastic in like-minded company. Yes, he can fix your computer or tutor you in calculus.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262030">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262030/#Comment_262030" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-15T10:39:53+00:00" title="March 15, 2010 10:39AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In a specific gaming context...<br><br>In Shadowrun (1st Edition, anyway), the character classes were called "Archetypes", which told you generally what their skills were, what their game role was, what they did in the game world, etc. So your character's archetype might be Street Samurai, so I kind of know what your guy does.<br><br>If you said "Yeah, my dude is your stereotypical street samurai", that would tell me even more about him (he's another badass lone-wolf with dark glasses who Gets Things Done and speaks tersely). <br><br>But you could play a more interesting version of that archetype by changing a few things around so it wasn't *just* a stereotype. ("My dude's a street samurai, but he's a Zen monk kind of guy and doesn't like fighting, and also he tells really awful jokes constantly.")                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
