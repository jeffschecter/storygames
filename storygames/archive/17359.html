During the course of playtesting I realized my game no longer did what I wanted it to and I set it aside for a while to work on other projects. I have now moved back to it with renewed vigor, and I think that I am moving in the right direction. I have run into a bit of a snag though. Everything on my character sheet is a trait that can be used to gain a die for a roll, save for the Name. I know I could just leave the name as a non mechanic, but as the setting requires that each person have a name of importance to the character, the name actually means a lot in fiction. I would love for it to mean a lot in the mechanics as well. I just can't seem to suss it out. How do I make the name not less vague, while still giving them the freedom to pick a name that they want?<br/><br/>Thoughts? Or was I too rambling in my questions? If I need to clear it up in some way I can certainly try.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_393289">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393289/#Comment_393289" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-13T21:02:59+00:00" title="October 13, 2012  9:02PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 13, 2012 9:03PM by Rickard.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This could be a bit shallow, but in a friend's game the players always got a die when then declared their character's actions in third person, because it was a story being told rather than a character being played.

You assign your Name stat a die (starting at d6 or d8), and you roll it with every single roll, because, being a Greek Hero, your name is everything! It's your legend, your reputation, your recognition, etc. As you progress in the game, you can bump your Name die up like any other stat (and, because it's rolled every single time you do anything, there's a pretty good incentive to do so). It's also a really elegant solution to making sure a player always has at least one die to roll. And there's no requirement to, like, have a specific name, you just make up your name and then assign the Name die separately at character creation.<br/><br/>Another inspiration could be Burning Wheel's Circles. Specifically, treat the Name die (or whatever) as an always-available thing to roll to know if you know someone in the scene, or to find someone you need to find. As it gets bigger, it means you have more reputation and ability to find people you need in a pinch.<br/><br/>Hope that's helpful.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_393313">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393313/#Comment_393313" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-14T09:16:16+00:00" title="October 14, 2012  9:16AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Does "Do: Flying Temple" use name as resolution mechanism?</blockquote>\nActually, your name in Do is basically your entire character.  Your name has two parts, which are symbolic of the actions your character takes.  The first part tells you how your character gets in trouble.  The second part tells you how they help people.  So Yellow Bag might get in trouble by being frightened (yellow = cowardice) while he helps people by always having the right object on hand.  Sleeping Tiger might get in trouble by being lazy or narcoleptic, but help people by being stealthy or cunning.<br/><br/>You could take that into other genres by changing the example names.  Lots of fiction uses names as symbols for the characters personality (see Willy Loman in <i>Death of a Salesman</i>, Sawyer on <i>Lost</i>, Grima Wormtongue in the Lord of the Rings, etc.).  <br/><br/>So you could easily work something like this into many RPGs: "Name your character. Explain how that name symbolizes an aspect of your character's personality.  When you act in a fashion that your name symbolizes, you get your bonus die (or whatever)".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_393314">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Snake_Eyes" title="Snake_Eyes"><img alt="Snake_Eyes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Snake_Eyes">Snake_Eyes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393314/#Comment_393314" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-14T09:20:53+00:00" title="October 14, 2012  9:20AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I meant "doesn't", not does.

A character revealing their name to another could be a sign of trust. In the Mountain Witch, let's say the ronin all use pseudonyms and slowly reveal their names in the story. Ayaka tells her name to Ichirou, who realises that Sanshirou, whose name he also knows, must be the samurai that razed her village to the ground one year ago. Does he keep them apart or try to bring them together? Does he reveal the truth (or, at least, his suspicions) to one or both? Does he berate or attack Sanshirou (or Ayaka)? Does he blackmail Sanshirou? How is this knowledge established by the players?<br/><br/>You can add to this - people can lie about their name, for one thing, and perhaps there's a difference between relying on people and trusting them, in which the former could be used to describe physical or mental capabilities and the latter is about someone's personal disposition and relationships. Knowing the capabilities of your supposed allies changes the way you approach problems even if you don't fully trust them. To take the tMW example, Sanshirou just watched Ichirou dispatch a particularly fearsome ogre guarding a gate in the fortress. He can <i>rely on</i> Ichirou to kill things with ease, but can he <i>trust</i> Ichirou to side with him in the final battle? Can Ichirou <i>rely on</i> Sanshirou to be dead weight and watch from the sidelines?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_393330">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/gtroc" title="gtroc"><img alt="gtroc" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/gtroc">gtroc</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393330/#Comment_393330" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-14T15:32:52+00:00" title="October 14, 2012  3:32PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Another inspiration could be Burning Wheel's Circles.
