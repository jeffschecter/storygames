But this is just a "Little Idea". Let me explain, bear with me:<br/><br/>1. I am NOT crazy.<br/><br/>I am not actually intending to play IaWA with prenegotiated stakes. That would be pretty stupid. I am well aware how that would be a total subversion of the way the system works, and probably harm gameplay in a serious way. However:<br/><br/>2. I AM being serious about this. The topic is not a joke!<br/><br/>Here's the deal:<br/><br/>The IaWA method works really well in its context: an intense, high-stakes, high-conflict story where the protagonists are powerful, desperate, passionate, driven.<br/><br/>The sort of typical "set stakes and roll once" method is a nice way that is more flexible in handling everything from a little disagreement to a major one. Setting stakes also lets people know what they're in for before they roll--it's more friendly and out in the open. All bad stuff for IaWA, but good for lots of other games.<br/><br/>So, here's a thought I had last night about combining the two in such a way that you transition from one to the other. In other words, IaWA starts out pretty much all-out. I'd like to be able to start a little gentler, and then <i>escalate</i> to the wild IaWA face-stabbing. <br/><br/>Let's ignore what the actual system is for the moment. Just know that people in conflict roll off against each other.<br/><br/><b>The Idea</b><br/><br/>When you get into a conflict, both sides name their stakes, then roll. Most of the time, that's it. The winner gets what they wanted.<br/><br/>However, the loser can choose to reroll, putting some more meat on the line. We go into a second round, but this time there is a default consequence to the loser. If they lose again, they can stop and accept that consequence or negotiate.<br/><br/>However, they could choose to reroll again, upping the default consequence higher. (I would limit this to three rounds, though, like in IaWA, because that feels about perfect.)<br/><br/>This is what it would look like with IaWA (again, I am not actually suggesting that anyone, including myself, play IaWA this way--the game plays great as it is--this is just for illustration):<br/><br/>* Set stakes and roll.<br/>* Go to second round? Now the default consequence is to lose one die size from a form.<br/>* Go to third round? Now the default consequence is to lose two die sizes from two forms.<br/><br/>If you lose, you lose the stakes <i>and</i> you suffer the consequences (though you can negotiate something else, as always). For instance, we're rolling for you to take the ring away from me. It goes to three rolls. If you win, you take the ring from me, for sure (but I agreed to that as a stake upfront). In addition, you might injure me, throw me off the cliff, or something else (we negotiate for that now).<br/><br/>So, that's the Little Idea.<br/><br/><i>One thing I'm not 100% sure about: If you lose in the second or third round, do you only suffer the more severe consequences if you were the loser before, or do both people face the same heightened consequences?</i> <br/><br/>How does it look? Functional? Totally whacked? How could it go wrong?<br/><br/>[edited for grammar]                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176873">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176873/#Comment_176873" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-31T09:56:59+00:00" title="October 31, 2008  9:56AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you'd only want the loser to suffer consequences.

(I'm actually not quite following here, but an example of play might help?)</blockquote>\nJust in case anyone's following, or wants to try this...<br/><br/>The key is as follows:<br/><br/>You go into the conflict saying what you want to achieve and how you are trying to achieve it. You get your desired goal if you can "stay in the fight" longer than everyone who is opposing you. If you drop out, then you don't get your desired goal. (It's actually easier to think in terms of "not getting your goal"--if you got knocked out of the fight--than to try to figure out what conditions are necessary for you to achieve your goal--it'll be obvious after a roll or three that you can get your goal, since no one is opposing you any more.)<br/><br/>This means that you can name opposed or orthogonal goals, as you wish. It doesn't matter.<br/><br/>Staying in the fight longer means you risk more serious consequences if you drop out.<br/><br/>Example:<br/><br/>You want the Orb, and I want to stop you. We roll once: if you win, and I give in, you get the Orb, and I suffer whatever seems a logical outcome based on your action (like you tackle me and knock me over). <br/><br/>If I decided to push on and it goes to three rolls, then you get the Orb AND I'm knocked over plus I lose two die sizes, or we negotiate some more serious injury or circumstance instead of those two die sizes. Maybe you broke my arms in the process or something, for instance.<br/><br/>If there's someone else trying to get the Orb, or trying to keep you from getting it, we don't know if you got the Orb just yet--only that I'm lying on the floor with the broken arms.<br/><br/>It means we can set some stakes at the beginning, but if people are fighting hard, things may turn out in unexpected and bloody ways.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
