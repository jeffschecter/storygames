I've been in Asia for the last 3 months on business (flying home tomorrow!), so I haven't had a chance to play it yet, unfortunately.  From the reading, at least, it ~feels~ a lot like Fiasco, in a comfortable way, yet does plenty to differentiate itself from Fiasco.  The two games are focused on providing a different set of experiences and stories.  <br/><br/>I'm not sure how much more I can add right now, having not played it yet.  The game's setup phase looks looks quite fun.  The planet descriptions are restrictive enough to promote some wonderful creativity and evocative enough to help make some really memorable settings.  The two-character thing looks to spread the story around, creating a nice web of problems for all the characters involved.<br/><br/>In short, it looks lovely, and I'm dying to give it a try.<br/><br/>--The Abbott                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390403/#Comment_390403" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-16T07:07:41+00:00" title="September 16, 2012  7:07AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Durance is in final layout and should be in backers hands in October.

Had a great scene where the sex-addicted Captain of the Marines coerced the Sable (played by another player) into giving it up.  Then he said, "Is that the best you can do?"<br/><br/>Ouch.<br/><br/>The Planet and Colony burning has been liked by all who've played it.  Everyone gets a bit of something but not enough, which is then mirrored in the actual game.  Choosing the Drive has been a bit strange as we've ended up with Control twice.  Character creation is brief and giving characters other than your own their Oaths is great.  Putting characters with highly conflicting oaths in scenes is beautiful (if your idea of beauty is things going badly wrong).<br/><br/>The event table is improved since the playtest with the chance of epic events happening with a more appropriate regularity.  So far we have not had one, but minor events have triggered a number of times and it adds a pleasant, but not story-breaking twist to the game.  FYI events trigger when the uncertainty dice are rolled and there is a tie.<br/><br/>Scenes play out reasonably naturally - it helps just to say to newer people not to worry about what their character is like but that we'll find out in a scene.  Early scenes were more about character exposition and then we ramped up to scenes that challenged players oaths.  Mechanically breaking an oath alters aspects of the game.<br/><br/>I have found on occasion found Fiasco a little loosey-goosey but Durance tightens things up nicely.  Yes, it's probably all going to go wrong but playing it out is perversely delicious.<br/><br/>Thanks, Jason and Steve.  This is, IMHO, your best game yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_390450">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390450/#Comment_390450" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-16T14:02:24+00:00" title="September 16, 2012  2:02PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I facilitated a game at the Escapist Expo today where, as Her Excellency the Governor, I cleaned house among the rotten ranks of my own administration, replaced the "resigned" Captain of Marines with his criminal counterpart (after she murdered the Dimber Damber as payment for emancipation), and finally locked a proselytizing Wrecker in a solitary confinement cell so deep she'd never be heard from again.

At the same time, we were able to tell a pretty compelling story in those 2 hours.  Our Dimber Damber died in his court under his pear tree, the natives waged an all-out attack on the colonists who were manufacturing "soma"-style drugs out of the natives' eggs, the Wrecker's cult -- obsessed on the mercy-killing of Colony children once they reached 18 -- interpreted the invasion as its Rapture moment, and the colonists responsible for harvesting the eggs went "Dances with Wolves" on the whole colony.  All this, and relatively cohesively, in under 2 hours.<br/><br/>Durance is the most freeform system I've seen outside of straight-up improvisation and/or Baron Munchausen.  Once the colony has been established, it's simply a series of exploratory questions that tends to escalate with time.  Ask question, set scene, determine outcome.  Repeat until story ends.<br/><br/>You (royal "you") will either love the freedom of Durance or you will hate it.  If you were "on the fence" with establishing scenes in Fiasco, preferring instead to have other establish for you, I really recommend playing Durance before purchasing it.  That said, it's what? $25, and if you're comfortable with setting big scenes in which you have little to no control save the manner in which the outcome is resolved, jump on this train.<br/><br/>Hopefully it will be in stores before BGG.con and Thanksgiving.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_390590">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jda1974" title="jda1974"><img alt="jda1974" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jda1974">jda1974</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390590/#Comment_390590" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-17T15:27:00+00:00" title="September 17, 2012  3:27PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Those sound like great sessions!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390677">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390677/#Comment_390677" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-18T10:48:27+00:00" title="September 18, 2012 10:48AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Durance has a lot of cool bits to it.  Creating the planet together.  Playing both a criminal and a law character.  Creating Oaths and then angling the game to force people into breaking them or dealing with them.  All of these are excellent and worked really well four our group.<br/><br/>My judge advocate had an Oath to never doubt in the fact that humans were basically good and the prisoners could be redeemed.  So he was always being lenient on the prisoners because he believed that they were actually decent people in bad situations.  This came into conflict with the Governor's decision to root out corruption in the ranks, as the governor assumed I was being bribed.  Hilarity ensued.<br/><br/><br/>When we played, we had some trouble with the dice mechanic/resolution stuff.  I'm not sure if we were doing something wrong or what. If I can't figure out how to use that resolution system next time we play, then we'll just hack that part out and replace it with some other dice system that works for us.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_392126">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Blurry" title="Blurry"><img alt="Blurry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Blurry">Blurry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392126/#Comment_392126" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-02T13:44:47+00:00" title="October  2, 2012  1:44PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played my first Durance game recently and we had a ton of fun with it. The beginning was a little rocky as we adjusted to the idea of Questions and the role of the Guide, but we eventually ironed it out and cruised through the rest. Croffin's Hole on the planet Oakes Two was nuked by the Authority after a prison riot - much of the population managed to escape to a safe distance, only to be enslaved by the furious natives and their giant now-radioactive gecko-bats.<br/><br/>If I play again, I'm going to do the following, which I think will help everyone find their feet faster and give us more creativity fuel:<br/><br/>* Make sure every player has their own copy of the Ladder. It's so much easier to have the names right there in front of you instead of sharing one sheet.<br/><br/>* When a planet / colony has been determined, write some (or all) of the optional flavor details down on cards and put them in the middle of the table. They're there if you want 'em and if something doesn't fit or work, turn it over or throw it away. There were several moments when having an interesting detail to draw upon would have helped me come up with a cool Question.<br/><br/>* Definitely go through the "What we should be thinking about as we flesh out our Notables" questions after everyone has created their two Notables. It adds some time to notable creation but they're good questions that add a lot of detail (and hooks) to the characters.<br/><br/>* I would emphasize the importance of finding relationship connections between the characters whenever possible, especially while answering the "fleshing out" questions. We wound up with a lot of characters who didn't really have connections to each other except for obvious ones (Dimber Damber and Abbott, for instance) which made coming up with the first few Questions really difficult.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jda1974" title="jda1974"><img alt="jda1974" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jda1974">jda1974</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392130/#Comment_392130" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-02T14:00:59+00:00" title="October  2, 2012  2:00PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, sound so cool.

Keep any players that want to stay, add new players and have them pick up characters (existing or new) and continue the story.

Even in the replay, the Captain Sharp sounded like she was just in the early stage of her dramatic arc when her oath was broken. <br/><br/>I don't want to judge the rule without having played it, but I was wondering if you can help me understand the thinking here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394016">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394016/#Comment_394016" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-19T18:06:18+00:00" title="October 19, 2012  6:06PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 19, 2012 6:07PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The oath-breaking is meant to be pivotal and transformative, so in the context of a shared story more about the world than about any individual, making that decision is a delicious, tension-preserving point to cut away. <br/><br/>In my play it's a "now? No? What about now?" type deal  most of the time. When you break an oath you're ready to put the focus elsewhere. One the guy who swore he'd never kill has killed, what more is there to say? You know where that guy is going. You can play it out in detail, sure, and that can be fun, and the game doesn't really prevent it.
