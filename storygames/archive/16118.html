To get Handiwork, you need to Expand your farm to include "a workbench, tools, and the skill to use them" (coming up with costs for expansions is super fun btw! so maybe this complexity is welcome), and to actually create some Handiwork using the 'bench, you need tools and wood. Wood you can buy for a silver. Tools cost two.<br/>So I guess the "cheat" to become a fisherman quickly is to purchase the tools and wood and pick Workbench and Boat&amp;Nets as your two up-front options. Only problem is that this is pretty capital-intensive (3silver each go-around) and honestly I'm not sure the omega-3 fatty acids are worth it <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> But by god if you want to fish, you can make it happen. <br/><br/>It seems like the best use of your time, at least in terms of sheer survival, is to pick the Arable Land (which grows valuable crops) and the Barren Wilderness (which produces stone and wood, useful commodities). You can convert each point of labor into 2 silver worth of crops, which you can use to buy slaves and grow the enterprise. Being a Man is very much about being a 10th century agrarian semi-capitalist. It's fascinating! I will add that having a flock of sheep seems like an OK strategy too, but having to trade wool to get other things you more immediately need means that it can be dicey.<br/><br/>Farming also puts you in some interesting fictional territory: because I didn't always make my family Labor beside me, they didn't always consume a food-item each season. To keep from feeling like a monster, I decided that they must be mostly living off of milk and cheese (we had a flock of sheep) and the occasional mutton or root vegetables was more like a supplement or a treat that gave them the extra wherewithal to join me in the fields.<br/><br/>But boy was it nice to choose the Huscarl move "raider" at the end of the first winter, and retcon it so that I found a little food by raiding a cattle ranch a few leagues away, with the fellows. That, and the one about aging: I really needed that extra point of +versed for bean-counting!<br/><br/>Honestly I think the Man is a superior, more effective version of what the Operator is supposed to be - a character you play because you're interested in watching someone scrape by and make hard choices after screwing up or getting into trouble. Basically if you don't know how to jump into the fiction with both feet, play a Man and let the Norns push you hither and yon like a boat with no rudder! I guarantee you'll eventually get close enough to the rocks or so far out to sea that you'll jump up and do something, and have a really solid fictional "underpinning" for doing so.<br/><br/>In a few Moves, the Man playbook will force the GM to conjure up a reasonably detailed picture of the local economy, at least in commodities. When my Man went to buy a slave with silver from raiding, it begged the question, "Who will sell him a slave, just like that?" The lack of "marketplace" moves means, imo, that all that stuff has to be quite explicitly narrated.<br/>As a side note, the Bonds system is phenomenal. So evocative! It takes the AW/Hx concept of "higher Hx means they know more about you" and fills in some awesome details, plus of course connecting Bonds and XP much more directly means that people are going to be coming over for tea ale all the goddamn time.<br/><br/>Howard Dean and I agree that this is a good thing. <br/><img alt="image" src="https://encrypted-tbn1.google.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTeAn_4DZKA_VdCLF1fJfnmpk4y5fvyI3KAhiT8O1tcqxIs5FHB"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_367477">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus" title="Dionysus"><img alt="Dionysus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/694/n0ANCVBURZLRD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus">Dionysus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367477/#Comment_367477" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-14T08:57:53+00:00" title="March 14, 2012  8:57AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This sounds totally awesome!<br/><br/>(furiously thinking how i can incorporate this sort of thing into my currently running game in a totally different system...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_367561">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367561/#Comment_367561" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-14T11:35:05+00:00" title="March 14, 2012 11:35AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            haha well just take the resource-producing part of the system, knock down the adjoining walls, and put in a nice little breakfast nook where things can go wrong.<br/><br/>translation: take the blacksmithing rules and make it so that a failed dice roll or skill check or whatevs could have consequences beyond the immediate "aw your sword sucks bro LOL" - - maybe you could finish the sword on time if you resort to black magic, but if you DON'T finish the sword on time you'll be out of a job and homeless.<br/><br/>resource production, and its flipside of Scarcity, can make for some really excellent story gaming stuff to tackle.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
