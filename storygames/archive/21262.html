I've never heard it before now. If I understand what it means correctly from how people used it in that thread, isn't that the whole point of Rune Quest? It's D&amp;D with bounded accuracy? <br/><br/>* In other news, I design games, and I've never played 5e. I don't think I'm suffering much. :P Also, most of my favorite games were designed before 5e was even a twinkle in Mearls' eye, so I don't think they suffered much either. :P <br/><br/>* I'm curious about Shahida. I read a review that described it as a work of non-fiction, with a game that you can apply to it in an appendix. If I remember correctly, Ron calls the game "Story Now."

It's basically a narrativist low-key blood opera rpg with latter-ages Forgite tech. Sort of like Legends of Alyria (think players setting up their own scenario, play focusing on resolving the inherent contradictions in the situations of the characters), except set in cold war Berlin. It looks stranger than it is, really, and it works with some quite interesting avant-garde story gaming concepts such as non-protagonist viewpoint characters, inexplicit conflict resolution and unreliable narrators.<br/><br/>I'm not as well-versed on Shahida, but from all I've heard it's roughly similar in scope - a game accompanied by a number of essays (or vice versa if you prefer). I'll need to take a look one of these days; Spione is a very interesting thing, so perhaps Shahida is is as well.<br/><br/>"Story Now" is sort of Ron's rebranding of roleplaying. His idea with Spione (and later Shahida) was to write an intelligent book about an important, non-geeky subject matter, and market it to the mainstream with a rpg snuck in under a new moniker. Part of the idea was, I understand, to review and question the hidden premises of "roleplaying", which is why the game texts may read a bit funny - Ron is presumably writing for people who'd approach the game not so much as a "game" than a storified extension of political and autobiographical salon discourse. Not being a native in English I'm not competent to comment on the choice to use a phrase like "Story Now" as a noun, but apparently that's sort of the name of the kind of thing that these games are - a synonym for "roleplaying game" or "story game" or whatever else we might call this kind of thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465855">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JustinA" title="JustinA"><img alt="JustinA" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JustinA">JustinA</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465855/#Comment_465855" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-23T06:57:55+00:00" title="August 23, 2017  6:57AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing to understand about "bounded accuracy" is that at least 95% of roleplaying and storytelling games just do it automatically, because the vast majority of games don't feature a radical progression of character ability.<br/><br/>"Bounded accuracy" as a term, therefore, only has meaning in the very specific lineage of D&amp;D, which looks roughly like this:<br/><br/>- D&amp;D traditionally has a HUGE variance in power over the course of play. In fact, the game play of high level D&amp;D is fundamentally different from low level D&amp;D on a mechanical level.<br/><br/>- There has, however, been a gradual trend line for rolling that back and making high level play look more and more like low level play.<br/><br/>- 3rd Edition did a few things to accelerate the desire for this: First, it finished stripping out the high-level game structures. Second, it sped up the accumulation of XP* so that players were far more likely to speed past the point where the dice range began to break down. Third, the playing culture became obsessed with My Perfect Encounter(TM) design methodologies (which the original designers had not anticipated and didn't actually design the game for).<br/><br/>- 4th Edition fixed these problems by locking all the dice progressions into a largely lock-step progression (the numbers got bigger, but the results and range never changed).<br/><br/>- 5th Edition looked at 4th Edition and said, "There's no reason for us to have ever-inflationary numbers. If we want to lock in just one style of game play as the only style of game play in D&amp;D (and we do), then we can just lock in that style of play."<br/><br/>D&amp;D thus exited that 5% and entered the common 95% of games, and they hung the term "bounded accuracy" on the result.<br/><br/>* This can be quibbled with, but certainly in widespread practice if not necessarily in terms of rigorous mechanical analysis.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465863">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/paganini" title="paganini"><img alt="paganini" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/paganini">paganini</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465863/#Comment_465863" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-23T16:58:46+00:00" title="August 23, 2017  4:58PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">@Eero_Tuovinen</a>, thanks for the rundown.
