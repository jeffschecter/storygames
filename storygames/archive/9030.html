Just ran Mouse Guard last Thursday! That was easily one of the best games I've run. Thanks to a very well written set of rules, a great setting and a group of excellent players, it was really, really good! We played the "Deliver the Mail" scenario and it was great!<br/><br/>It all went very smoothly and at no point did I feel overwhelmed. But I realize now that I funged up the way teamwork is handled.<br/><br/>Instead of having one team help the other with (only) 1d of help when their actions coincided, I was allowing the players (two on each team) to each give 1d of help. So the person rolling for it was getting 1d from the other player on his team, and +1d more from the two players on the other team. That extra 1d maybe gave them a bit of an edge, but hey, first game, first big fight - they needed it.<br/><br/>Also, one team of mice got taken to zero as a the result of an Attack vs. Attack, but the other team kept fighting, and we kept going until it was all over (the second team knocked the raven to zero in the following round). My question here is: if there are two teams on one side, and one of them gets reduced to Disposition 0 and the other is fine and still in the fight, and they both have the same goal (in this case, keep the mailbag and drive the raven off), what happens to the team got knocked to zero? <br/><br/>In the end, I treated it as if the Guard Mice (as one side) lost half their Dispo (half if you added both teams' starting Dispo together), won with a compromise, and gave the guys who went to zero the Injured condition and the other team got the Tired condition (and they lost a few letters out of the bag).<br/><br/>So, to re-state, basically in a multi-team conflict, if one team on a side goes to Dispo zero, but the other team is still engaged, is holding off assigning conditions/compromises until it's over, and combining both teams' Dispo when you do, the way to go? <br/><br/>And we're going to do a campaign!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_199580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199580/#Comment_199580" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-30T16:55:05+00:00" title="March 30, 2009  4:55PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We had a couple of multi-team battles and handled it a few different ways -- mostly because I screwed up.<br/><br/>I think I would recommend that each team having a separate Disposition also have a distinct goal in the conflict.

But you guys over here succeeded and drove the raven away, so it escapes with the mailbag." "Hey, we didn't want it to get away with the mailbag either!"<br/><br/>I guess you'd just have negotiate the goals, though I think if two teams both have exactly the same goal, there should be a way to accommodate that.\n<blockquote>The few times we tried to run things other ways, with different groups sharing a single Disposition and goal, things got really weird.

Again, this is an absolute in BW games.  If your enemy sets the stakes "catch up with the heros," as in the example, there's absolutely no need for you to set the goal "get away from my pursuer."  Why?  Because if you win the conflict, then your <i>enemy doesn't get his goal.</i>  You have to ask for something more than simply "get away," like "capture my pursuer."  Make sure the stakes are reasonably proportionate, too.<br><br>Matt                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_200054">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa" title="Mike Montesa"><img alt="Mike Montesa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2395/2470886071_32bd4c6f2f.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa">Mike Montesa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200054/#Comment_200054" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-01T22:54:37+00:00" title="April  1, 2009 10:54PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 1, 2009 11:29PM by Mike Montesa.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Deliverator</cite>It's really not.  You essentially let the mice double their dispo with no consequences.  If there aren't two distinct things they want out of the conflict, then make them fight as a unit.<br><br>Matt</br></br></blockquote>\nWell, there were consequences - conditions handed out (Injured to the team that got taken to zero, and Tired for the other team) and a compromise (they lost some of the mail).<br/><br/>And I'd have liked to have had  them fight as a unit, but we went with 2 teams since I read to split a group of 4 (having a group of 4 is recommended against on p.113) into 3/1 or 2/2. <br/><br/>I know it may not have been exactly by the rules but - it was my first time running and I was trying to go fast and keep the pace up and get my head around all the rules. <br/><br/>With both teams having the same goal, it kinda became a race then, to see which team would accomplish it first. If Team A had knocked the Raven to zero first, they'd have achieved their goal (and Team B's goal, so they'd have been happy too). Team A knocked the Raven to 1 before they got taken out, and Team B finished the job. When Team A got knocked out, Team B was still in it and so the fight continued. <br/><br/>Team A went to zero Dispo and lost their part of the conflict. Team B lost only 1 point in the whole fight and won. Both teams had the same goal. Since the fight wasn't over, I held off on the final assessment. In the narrative, when Team A went down, the raven did get the bag away from them and was trying to take flight. On the next round, Team B seized the dangling bag, bashed the Raven to Dispo zero, and the bird gave up and flew away.<br/><br/>The Raven's goal applied to both teams (get the bag and fly away). It beat Team A and had there been only one team it would have achieved its goal (but owed the Mice a Major Compromise since it had been so badly beaten up). But because Team B was still in it, and had the same goal as Team A (keep the bag and drive the raven away), I figured, OK, we keep going and I figure it out when it's over. So Team B finished the job and achieved their goal.<br/><br/>If it had just been a single team winning with only that single point knocked off their Dispo, the consequences would have less severe of course - maybe they lose a few letters but no Conditions imposed. But with one team having been beat up and the other not getting hit very hard at all, that's why I decided to split the difference.  I added the two teams starting Dispo, subtract what was lost on both teams, and use that. Team A had 7 and Team B had 6, so 13 total and they finished with 5, so they lost just over half so I went for the Compromise. I know that wasn't in the rules but hey, I had to do something and I couldn't find a guideline in book in the heat of the moment.<br/><br/>And I'm also not sure I should have slapped each of the Mice with a Condition?<br/><br/>I don't necessarily think it's bad to have two teams with the same goal in a conflict (though there are certainly times when it may be bad). Sure, the goals can be refined (you guys play offense, we'll pay defense) but it seemed to have worked here. But I couldn't find anything in the rules that addressed this issue (looking at p.102), so I had to interpret it. <br/><br/>Anyway, if there is a right way to have run this, I'm all ears.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_200121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200121/#Comment_200121" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-02T10:41:15+00:00" title="April  2, 2009 10:41AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I got home and looked at the rules, trying to figure out why I thought four-mouse groups should be split up for conflicts, and found that Crane does in fact advise, most strongly, that four mice be split into two teams.  In the paragraph about handling four PC mice, he never once mentions having all of them be on one team, saving the possibility for a later comment on the team composition rules.  He seems to consider four-a-side to be a last resort, when you can't justify two groups.<br/><br/>That would seem to firmly contradict positions adopted by earlier commenters that you shouldn't worry about two teams with similar-to-identical goals not only doubling up on dispo, but also coordinating actions so that one group is always taking an independent action while the other goes versus to bring the largest number of dice possible to bear against the bad guy(s).  Crane clearly contemplated having two groups of two on the same side of a fight, but didn't provide any guidance for what happens when one PC group's disposition is reduced to zero, then the opposition is reduced to zero, while the second PC group stays positive.<br/><br/>It is nowhere (I think) mentioned in the MG text, but the suggestion to make each team articulate a somewhat different goal seems like a great one to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
