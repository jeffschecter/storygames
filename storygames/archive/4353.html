Which, to be fair, is not the worst of default mindsets to fall into.<br/><br/>Sometimes, though, it's precisely the wrong mindset to use.  Sometimes people just want to celebrate, or gloat, or share, and in those cases even very well-intentioned advice can be traumatic for everyone.<br/><br/>I wish I knew what to do about this but I don't.  Maybe it just comes down to putting 'I AM GLOATING I WILL NOT TOLERATE HELPFUL ADVICE' at the top of the first post or something.  Or maybe it's not as pressing an issue as I believe.<br/><br/>At the risk of becoming too recursive, I should state that I would like comments and criticism and advice on this.  Thanks.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Roger                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98200">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Quintin%20Stone" title="Quintin Stone"><img alt="Quintin Stone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://rps.net/QS/Images/pipboy-32x32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Quintin%20Stone">Quintin Stone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98200/#Comment_98200" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-21T13:06:36+00:00" title="September 21, 2007  1:06PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I've actually seen people run into this... trap?  Anyway, run into it a lot on rpg.net.  "Hi, I'm here to share this (good|bad) event--"  "HERE'S WHERE YOU WENT WRONG..."<br/><br/>Isn't it very much the point of forums like S-G to help each other?  As people become familiar with the flavor of a forum, they'll know when to ask for help and know when to ask for none.
