Enough fun that I've considered running something myself when the current playtest is all done and we're casting about for something new to do.<br/><br/>A couple of things are holding me back: I haven't run anything in quite a long time, and I want some of my creative desires addressed by the game.<br/><br/><a href="http://lumpley.com/apocalypse/" rel="nofollow">Apocalypse World</a> is all about emergent gameplay, drawing from the players the little details and bits of incident that make for a fully realized game without a lot of preparation ahead of time.  That's daunting unto itself because I have no real experience with that sort of GM/player dynamic, but there's more: the game is not designed with the MC in mind, at least the way I'm reading it.<br/><br/>If all the story and setting cues are coming from the players, what exactly is coming from the MC?  In this case the MC develops the little fragments into a reasonably comprehensive whole, which is all well and good, but what if the MC wants things to proceed in a way that's at odds, or at least inconsistent, with what the players are making?<br/><br/>For example: I want to run a game that's in keeping with <i>The Road Warrior</i> and have that whole Mad Max-y thing going on.  Ben, on the other hand, may have something entirely different in mind.  As the situation is posited by <a href="http://lumpley.com/apocalypse/" rel="nofollow">Apocalypse World</a>'s rules, his vision overrides my vision because I as the MC am tasked with making his desires come to fruition.<br/><br/>So what about my needs?  It's true that constructing fronts and all that creates a unique experience specific to the players involved, but there's very little (almost no) room for authorial intent.  Do I have to wait until I'm the player before I can have the game I want to play?  That doesn't seem right.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm misunderstanding things.  Like I said, this whole "emergent play" thing is new to me and I might be missing some fundamental understanding of just how it works.  Those of you with some <a href="http://lumpley.com/apocalypse/" rel="nofollow">Apocalypse World</a> experience under your belts can doubtless set my mind at ease, or at least explain how I'm mistaken.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244148/#Comment_244148" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-29T14:31:29+00:00" title="November 29, 2009  2:31PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think your overstating the lack of authorial intent on the MCs part. <br/><br/>First, the MC has alot flexibility and interpretation in terms of their Moves. If Vincent's advice seems prescriptive it's because of his tone and not because of the actual content. The Players' Moves are pretty specific and many of them delegate their outcome to the interpretation of the MC. <br/><br/>Second, when you sit down to play, just be like: You know that movie mad-max? That's pretty much what were doing. And then make sure that some one picks the driver. Then run-through an everyday on the road sort of thing, maybe have them stop for gas or whatever. Session One is over. Session Two+, hit them with fronts like the Bandit-King, Oil-Rig Hardhold and The Road.<br/><br/>When I've run AW, it's mostly been the other way around. <i>Dogs</i> gives the players' a ton of 'authorial intent,' with their Raises and Stakes. AW puts the vast majority of authorial intent in the MCs hands. Sure, it's not up to you to determine the outcome but you can put enough pressure on them to them the Players moving, even in a direction that you want. You want your Players to give you as much fonder as possible. Think of it like ingredients for a recipe. The more you get, easier it will be to cook the thing, but it's not going to make itself. That's the MCs job.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_244153">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour" title="FigureFour"><img alt="FigureFour" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour">FigureFour</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244153/#Comment_244153" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-29T15:40:27+00:00" title="November 29, 2009  3:40PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            While I'm not sure about Vincent's intent here, I think that in most situations like this when the "players" have authorial control it's implicit that the GM (or MC in this case) is ALSO A PLAYER. Just because everyone else gets a piece of the action doesn't mean you have to give up yours.<br/><br/>Now, specific to Apocalypse World, I think that the biggest limitation on the GMs input is in when he gets to make a move not what the move is. If you decide to Announce Future Badness there's no limitation on what that badness can be and the MCs idea of what a cool threat is should be just as valid as any other players. Drawing from the players is just there to give you a larger creative pool (and save your butt when you can't think of something) and to enhance the group's buy in/fun (if you reincorporate, you know in advance who's interested).<br/><br/>Apocalypse World really does seem to put lots of the narrative power in the MC's hands. He's responsible for making sure that the players are free to contribute, but the game seems FULL of situations where the MC is asked for information about  the world and is expected to give an authoritative answer. The MC is encouraged to turn the questions back on the other players SOMETIMES, but I got the impression that's only when the MC thinks it would be interesting or is stumped himself.<br/><br/>Now, when it comes to an overall narrative or stylistic theme, I don't think Apocalypse World actually gives ANYONE authority over that any more than that player has narrative authority over what happens in each scene. If you want a consistent vision, I'd assume it's up to the group to hash that out in advance like in Nathan's second point, or to decide on a case by case basis (using table consensus probably). Although, the case could be made that since it's the MC's job to make the world seem real, that gives him some implicit authority over setting and tone.<br/><br/>Interestingly enough, from my perspective the game is definitely designed with the MC in mind. There's 22 pages of rules to share amongst the players and 171 pages designed to help the MC do his part. The design of the MC's role gives you a very well structured system for running the game (something I LOVE to see) and really seems to be there to make sure that the MC always knows what to do to keep things running smoothly. It's like a big GM's toybox so every time you need something to pull out you can just look down at your fronts and say "Oh, the guys really liked Newton. Maybe Last and Grome will beat him up and drag him off to that cannibal cult."<br/><br/>Also, where did you see that it's the MC is tasked with making the player's desires come to fruition? I thought it was pretty clear that the MC's job is to keep things not boring and make the world seem real (and harsh, and violent . . .)<br/><br/>Anyway, long story short, no one's vision should override anyone else's. You're all in this together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244155/#Comment_244155" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-29T16:01:03+00:00" title="November 29, 2009  4:01PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 29, 2009 5:01PM by lumpley.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah. As MC your job is to make Apocalypse World seem real, and to make the characters' lives not boring. It's absolutely not your job to bring the players' desires to fruition.<br/><br/>You'll probably sometimes, incidentally, bring the players' desires to fruition, but whatever. It's not your job to worry about the players' desires one way or the other.<br/><br/>One thing you're to do, by the rules, is cultivate your own personal aesthetic of apocalyptica, and express it fully in the game. The rules give you serious support in this regard, all <i>kinds</i> of authority appropriate to that calling. You shouldn't ever have to defer your vision.<br/><br/>Oh, incidentally - it's just random luck that I saw this thread here and had the opportunity to reply to it. My Story Games time is limited!

I mean, yeah, I ask the PCs questions, but I get to frame the questions. "How do you find water in this scorching radioactive desert wasteland?" will spell out an entirely different game from "So what protective measures do you take from mutated insects that plague the jungle outside your hardhold?"<br/><br/>In our game, I thought it would be cool if the world were plunged into endless nuclear winter, the skies eternally choked with smoke and the wind-swept ashes of all the civilization that burnt up in the Apocalypse. So that's what I just said was the case. I mean, yeah, I asked if people thought that was cool, but I still came up with the idea.<br/><br/>Plus, I came up with all the fronts and threats. "Man, I want a ruthlessly greedy tribute-demanding warlord (threat type: Collector), with a seriously-fucking-savage gang (threat type: Hunting Pack), and a creepy-ass Brainer as his right-hand man (threat type: Mindfucker), and a bad-ass compound (threat type: Fortress). That'd be awesome." I also decided the threat types for Amy's hardhold and associated hangers-on, and I've got a few ideas in the back of my head for later, too. At no point did I ask "So, what are the things that your character feels threaten their day-to-day life?" So that's <i>a lot</i> of situation-generating power that rests in the hands of the MC, too.<br/><br/>Really, now that you mention it, I'm kind of hard-pressed to think of ANYTHING that I've really left in the hands of the players, with obvious exceptions like "So what're the dudes in Hammer's gang like?" and a few other small and mostly unimportant details.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_244200">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244200/#Comment_244200" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-30T02:18:48+00:00" title="November 30, 2009  2:18AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Benhimself</cite>At no point did I ask "So, what are the things that your character feels threaten their day-to-day life?</blockquote>\nI basically asked this.

My understanding was that the questions were meant to draw out the setting and situations that players wanted, but I see now that just phrasing the question differently can put a lot of the establishing power in the MC's hands.<br/><br/>As far as positing a setting and tone ahead of time: I had gathered from the text that planning ahead was frowned upon, with the first session being character-centric and drawing, as I mentioned before, from the players' desires as to how the apocalypse is shaped.

I'll go back into those bits of the book before I publish.<br/><br/>When you're sitting down to play, especially the first session but not only it, there are a million empty spaces that need to be filled. Locale, climate, food supply, flora and fauna, local color, atmosphere, fashion, local society and identity, immediate history - everything that makes a setting seem like a real place. At that point, nobody at the table has any real preferences, players or MC; if somebody says something even a little bit cool, with even a little bit of confidence or enthusiasm, then the group will adopt it as given. I'm like "in the desert around the holding, wild dogs prowl, and some of them are as big as horses, as big as bison even, you can see their silhouettes but they never make any noise," and everybody takes it in. It's a relief whenever someone says something good and solid, it gives everybody else the footing they need.<br/><br/>The problem is when there's an empty space to fill and nobody steps in with anything. As MC, it's your responsibility to make sure that those spaces get filled, so planning some images to have at the ready is a very good idea. Cultivate an imagination full of apocalyptica, the rules say.<br/><br/>The MC has the responsibility to see that those spaces get filled, right, but it doesn't matter who actually fills them. If a player comes out with something even a little bit cool, with even a little bit of confidence or enthusiasm behind it, you can make sure that the group adopts THAT, just by adopting it yourself. You have oversight because of your responsibilities, and instructions specifically to <i>own</i> everything you affirm, that's all.<br/><br/>I hope you do MC the game! I'd love to hear how it goes.<br/><br/>-Vincent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_244774">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244774/#Comment_244774" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-03T03:06:21+00:00" title="December  3, 2009  3:06AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 3, 2009 9:15AM by DWeird.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Benhimself</cite>Plus, I came up with all the fronts and threats. "Man, I want a ruthlessly greedy tribute-demanding warlord (threat type: Collector), with a seriously-fucking-savage gang (threat type: Hunting Pack), and a creepy-ass Brainer as his right-hand man (threat type: Mindfucker), and a bad-ass compound (threat type: Fortress). That'd be awesome." I also decided the threat types for Amy's hardhold and associated hangers-on, and I've got a few ideas in the back of my head for later, too. At no point did I ask "So, what are the things that your character feels threaten their day-to-day life?" So that's<i>a lot</i>of situation-generating power that rests in the hands of the MC, too.</blockquote>\n<p>So, when Sammy was all "I scope out the armory all stealthy-like" and there was a bunker with three people defending the place, it was a Fortress move? And then when he got shot in the back, it was a Hunting pack move? And then when Balls got to play around with him, it was a Mindfucker move?

I think Balls messing with Sammy's head was either Putting Him On The Spot or Announcing Future Badness (A mindfucker knowing all your secrets pretty much entails that badness is going to happen in the future) but otherwise, yeah.<br/><br/>The twin MC rules of "Misdirect" and "Never speak your move's name", along with the list of moves, have pretty much run the game for me. (And, might I add, I really dig how they're <b>rules</b> for the MC, and not just "advice".)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
