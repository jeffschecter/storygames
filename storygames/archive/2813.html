One of these games was a scenario I played with Chris and Lisa Goodwin.<br/><br/>They used two of the <a href="http://www.berengad.com/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=16&amp;Itemid=34" rel="nofollow">sample characters</a>, Kelkha and Olor (they were a bit beefed up for the con). In this scenario, the two Beast Hunters are returning to camp to find it under attack from another tribe. The camp consists of a bunch of tents set alongside a rocky hill and a dense forest. The hostile warriors are streaming out of the woods, screaming and swinging their weapons. I created the following threat, which would have cost me 13 adversity points in a regular game:<br/><br/>Traits: Element of Surprise PO+4, Ferocious Fighters PO+4, Group Tactics PD+4<br/>Resources: Spears and Axes PO+3, Battlehardened PD+3<br/>Damage Levels: 2/1/1/1/1<br/><br/>Secondary Goals: Kidnap Children (15), Burn Down Camp (15).<br/><br/>Since we're talking vignettes here, here's the one point I found most interesting: As the advice in the book says, challenges and goals should be based not only what the character is interested in, but also the player.  When Lisa bought off the secondary goal to prevent the tribe's children from being kidnapped, she made comments about being a mother and the need to take care of kids. And that was very cool. It's not as easy to do this for con games, so picking something that many players would be interested in is a challenge in creating demo challenges.<br/><br/>I've put up a more complete AP report on <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=23706.0" rel="nofollow">the Forge</a> and <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=321336" rel="nofollow">RPG.Net</a>.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63873">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin" title="Chris_Goodwin"><img alt="Chris_Goodwin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/104/nWRZN6AU4P4W8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin">Chris_Goodwin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63873/#Comment_63873" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-13T19:26:29+00:00" title="April 13, 2007  7:26PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll crosspost here more or less what I posted in those other places: \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: xenopulse</cite>1) Once again, the AP offering system was my favorite part: it encouraged Chris and Lisa to make their actions creative and cool, and it allowed the players to gather advantage points whether they were attacking, maneuvering, calling on the spirits, or intimidating the enemy. </blockquote>\nThis is absolutely true.  There were a couple of times when I had to weigh accepting Christian's offer on the action or rolling the dice; I tend to be pretty bad at dice rolling, so I accepted each time.  I tried to make my descriptions awesome, and I think I did pretty well (well enough at least to get my denied resource back without having to roll for it).  Hint when playing this game:  make your descriptions as cool as you can.  Make the Challenger fight for everything.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote><br/>3) I managed to deny Khelka's huge battle axe, meaning the other tribe's chief disarmed Chris' character.  That caused a severe drawback to Chris, which was good as a tactical complication, for which the deny resource action was designed. Chris managed to retrieve it later with a neat duck-and-roll action.</blockquote>\nLet me tell you, the resource denial hurt.  I had to get it back in order to have a hope of winning. \n<blockquote>4) Naming the threat traits is important.  I used Element of Surprise not only in the beginning, as I had envisioned it, but it also inspired me to have enemy warriors sneak around the tents and ambush Olor.</blockquote>\nThe traits on the character sheet (the demo one we used at the con) made it clear that Kelkha was a total badass of a killing machine.  I didn't play her as effectively as I could have, mainly due to not having enough of either sleep or caffeine, but the traits tell you a lot about the character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
