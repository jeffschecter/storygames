Though I'm not supposed to judge a book by its cover, the art was evocative and the premise is likewise intriguing:\n<blockquote><i>The ghosts hate intruders<br/><br/>You are an intruder<br/><br/>They hate you</i><br/><br/>The year is 2110. In 2105, over a tenth of the world's population died when a number of space stations orbiting Earth went dead. The radiation that killed them had an unexpected side effect: The victims now haunt the halls, possessing machinery and threatening anyone that dares travel inside. <br/><br/><i>Maschine Zeit</i> is a science fiction/horror RPG from Machine Age Productions. The game's mechanics focus on movie logic, encouraging dramatic behavior and offering players control over most of the narrative. The game emulates the conventions of such genre works as <i>Alien</i>, <i>Pandorum</i>, <i>Event Horizon</i> and <i>Dead Space</i>. The setting information is all presented in-character, in the form of blogs, newspapers and other pieces of biased text, leaving the truth to fill in at the table. The system uses a d100, and can be learned or taught in minutes, but offers strategic players a shockingly vicious resource gambling mechanism.</blockquote>\nI could go for good, old-fashioned space creepies, but how well does the game do?  Absent any reviews or access to a preview, I can't begin to guess.  I understand it's been out for a little while, and maybe long enough to someone here to have had a look at it.

Rolls are pretty freeform, you get to allocate your limited resources however you'd like, so you get to choose when you get to be cool. I've run it without a GM/Narrator just using the basic rules to build the story, but I still kind of prefer having someone to work stuff up. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe rules are very simple. There's no combat system, it's all part of the core mechanic. That said, the rules for injury and dying are the most complicated. It's pretty brutal, I've seen a character die from something like a pencil stabbing. Well over half the material is in-character setting stuff, articles, blogs, news clippings, that sort of thing. It's made to be very biased, with plenty of holes for your players to fill in at the table. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt really just came out last week. I've given contributors pre-release copies and various documentation throughout the process, but I just released the public version last week. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, as Jason said: Ghost stories on space stations. You play a bunch of people that are in a place they shouldn't be, being slaughtered by things they don't understand.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_278463">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278463/#Comment_278463" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-29T05:01:52+00:00" title="June 29, 2010  5:01AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh hey, the other thing that grabbed me - you just reminded me - apparently the setting stuff is designed in such a way that you can pull out a random page from the book and use it as the seeds for that evening's ghost-murder-space-platform.

There's this sort of conspiracy undertone, where a lot of people worldwide have an interest in concealing the existence of the ghosts. So like, you might print out a leaked memo from the PR department of a huge medical firm, that'll give your players enough to vamp on and take the initiative to develop this conspiracy as they take their actions in-game. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe fiction is also just plain neat. A few of the people writing that stuff really brought game.

I guess most of my success with that came through social networking channels. A lot of people through Twitter and Facebook perpetuated the signal, that's where I got the majority of my contributors. I would say the second biggest chunk came from the in-person community. I went to a lot of conventions and FLGS to run demos, and a number of those players became part of the game. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe basic mechanics: <br/>\n<br/>\nYou have nine "Universal Elements." They're kind of like traditional RPG attributes, but they reflect more what you want your character to succeed in, not what they should be capable of. They're rated 5-25, and they have limited use in every session. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou have about nine "Personal Elements." They come in three categories, these are customizable. They're not dissimilar from Fate Aspects, for a basis of comparison. These aren't spent, and are rated 5-25. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou have a number of "Dramatic Elements" equal to seven minus the party size. Those are worth 25 points each. You get them back by adversely affecting yourself. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou add two Universal Elements, one Personal Element, and optionally a Dramatic Element into a chance for success. Theoretically, you can have 100% pretty easily with a Dramatic Element. You make your roll, you try to get under that number. For every ten that you beat it by, something else can happen in the scene, with minor limitations. These things add to the scene, but don't necessarily relate directly to your character. <br/>\n<br/>\nInjury also uses a percentage, but it's compiled from two numbers. The bigger of the two is suffered the first time you get injured by something bigger than what you've been injured by so far. The smaller is for repeat injury. It reflects the fact that when you're shot, it sucks terribly, you're on the ground crying. But then, further shots only aggravate that, they're functionally not a lot worse than the first. Then, at the end of the scene, the percentage you've built helps you find out if you're okay. If you're not, you get progressively worse and have to check again until either you stabilize with a worse wound, or you die. Dying in media res isn't very likely in Maschine Zeit. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat's the basics of the system. We have a few nuances, like rolling to see if you have equipment when needed to reflect the horror convention of your flashlight being out of batteries, but that's more or less how it works.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
