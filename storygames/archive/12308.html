He's pointed out how his players' ideas of immersion, realism, fairness, style, adventure, sci-fi and spy fiction often clash.  One player wants to revel in realistic tech details while another wants to do ninja-movie back-flips; the first guy bores the second, and the second takes the first out of his immersive groove.<br/><br/>This got me thinking about two things: pre-game orientation, and supporting creative rights.<br/><br/><b>Pre-game orientation</b><br/>Most groups I've played with do a good job of establishing the facts and general tone of the gameworld.  Most groups I've played with do an awful job of establishing how that fiction is created by play.  Does a fictional event happen because it's plausible, because it's cool, because it's meaningful, or what?  When do we assume it, summarize it, or play through it in detail?  I've found that a little pre-game discussion of these sorts of things goes a long way.  Sometimes the game lays down the law, sometimes the GM lays down the law, but often enough there's space for discussion and consensus/compromise.<br/><br/>Once these agreements have been formed, I've found it <i>extremely</i> useful to refer back to them early in play as players are getting the hang of the game.  "Remember, we don't care about that unless it's developing the character," or, "Remember, we're not following adventure fiction here, if that trap would realistically kill you, it will kill you."  Asserting those things during play is infinitely easier if they've been previously agreed upon.<br/><br/><b>Supporting creative rights</b><br/>I was <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forge/index.php?topic=25453.msg245482#msg245482" rel="nofollow">discussing</a> Right to Dream with Ron Edwards, and I was surprised by how simple and vital that "right" turned out to be.  It's basically the right to contribute meaningfully to the fiction.  The scary thing is that, in many games, this doesn't happen!  I'm not talking about players telling each other "shut up" or "you can't do that" per se; there's a much wider range where, sure, I can play my character, but I can't use him to do anything that anyone else really cares about.<br/><br/>I don't have an all-purpose system for establishing a space in which everyone knows what sort of contributions matter to the group and is primed to make them.  I think it rightly varies from game to game.  But I do have an all-purpose philosophy that I've found effective in helping everyone to contribute:<br/><br/>1) Care about how the fiction is created by play (see above).  If you see someone playing in a way that clashes with your understanding of this, speak up, and figure out who's right for this game.<br/><br/>2) Care about others' interest in your contributions.  I think most of us do this just fine.  If you say something that you really thought would get a reaction, and no one cares, then be wary.  The second this becomes a pattern, stop play to clarify.  "Guys, I thought we liked X!  Is that wrong?  If so, I'm going to play my guy differently!"<br/><br/>3) Care about your interest in others' contributions.  Maybe I've been lucky, but I don't feel like I ever play with people who are just boring human beings with nothing to add to play.  So, if you're talking, and I'm bored, something is going wrong.  Again, if it becomes a pattern, stop play and address it.  Non-diplomatic version: "Dude, no one cares about that!  We're interested in X."  Diplomatic version: "I'm missing what you're going for with this.  Would you mind explaining to me how this relates to X?  Then I'll be able to respond better."<br/><br/>Obviously, these all work best if there's a pre-game agreement on X.  But even if there isn't, addressing disconnects can help forge one.<br/><br/>If my vision of Shadowrun play is a reality simulation where we care about clever tactics solving challenging missions, and your version is a power fantasy where we use badass gear to kick butt and take names, action-movie style, it's in both of our best interests to figure this out early on.  I don't necessarily mean stopping play for a twenty minute abstract discussion.  Simply saying, "Why are you spouting cliches while you shoot guards?" and hearing, "Cuz I'm fucking Bruce Willis, beeotch!" can be a first step toward that larger understanding.<br/><br/>Another way I'd phrase my philosophy: if you want the game to go a certain way, speak up for that.  If you're happy whichever way it goes, find out what the other players want to do, so you can do that.  If nothing's been agreed upon, then you <i>must</i> treat your vision (and everyone else's too) as provisional, until an agreement has been established through play.  No one can give me the right to be Bruce Willis except the play group.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275979">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275979/#Comment_275979" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-14T14:05:15+00:00" title="June 14, 2010  2:05PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sweet!<br/><br/>I don't know what to say except this a great distillation of some non-obvious but vital play practices.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_276047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276047/#Comment_276047" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-14T23:22:16+00:00" title="June 14, 2010 11:22PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 14, 2010 11:23PM by John_Harper.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            YES.<br/><br/>I fully endorse this with the biggest endorsement stamp I have, which is pretty big,                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_276053">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jprussell" title="jprussell"><img alt="jprussell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jprussell">jprussell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276053/#Comment_276053" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-15T00:30:10+00:00" title="June 15, 2010 12:30AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is good stuff!<br/><br/>My one question is how does this work out with people who are either a) completely new to roleplaying and so don't know "what you do" much less what way you do it in, or b) so used to one way of doing things that they don't recognize that it's *a* way and not *the* way?<br/><br/>I ask because I figure if you ask a totally new player "so, do you want to do plausible things, cool things, or dramatic things?" (or whatever choices) they'll probably be like "um, I dunno? How does this game work again?" <br/><br/>Likewise, I can imagine someone who has been playing for years but not thinking about all this high-falutin' 'addressing the fiction' type stuff and just "knows" you only explain what is plausible/cool/dramatic, but doesn't realize that's why he creates fiction the way he does.<br/><br/>I think both can probably be dealt with pretty easily (taking a bit of time to talk about what kind of story you want or what it would be like as a movie with the new player, or discussing the fact that there *is* a distinction with the 'set in his ways' player), but I would love to hear your thoughts, especially if you have real experience and not just my wild speculation!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_276058">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276058/#Comment_276058" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-15T01:17:38+00:00" title="June 15, 2010  1:17AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 15, 2010 1:20AM by David_Berg.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Paul &amp; John.<br/><br/>Jeff, <br/>How dare you expose my feel-good examples to the harsh light of real humans?!?!<br/><br/>I'll tell you the best I can offer from my own experience.  I have an odd sample, though.  Mostly, I GM for people I know well, or play at cons with other design enthusiasts, or playtest with various folks.<br/><br/>Most of the <b>veteran roleplayers</b> I game with enjoy thinking about design.

But as long as one player is aware, that's enough.<br/><br/>Most of the <b>noobs</b> that I introduce totally strange RPGs to are happy to be led.  Though a lengthy <b>pre-game intro spiel</b> may strain their attention spans somewhat, they'll usually soak it up pretty well, in the interest of learning how to play.<br/><br/>As for <b>folks who are set in their ways</b>:  When a player insists that something must be done a certain way, I ask them why, stressing the positives.  <i>What's cool about that, what's your favorite aspect?</i>  Once I know where they're coming from, I'm usually happy to go, "Okay, group, let's try to <b>do it this guy's way</b>!"  But, when I truly believe that it won't work for the game, I will say so in extremely certain terms:  "I'd love to do that with you in a D&amp;D game, but in <i>this</i> game, we are doing something <i>completely</i> different.  If you decide it's not for you, fair enough; but for now, <b>try it our way</b>."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_276075">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276075/#Comment_276075" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-15T06:18:53+00:00" title="June 15, 2010  6:18AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            More good observations and ideas!<br/><br/>I'll just add a note:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite><br/>Most of the<b>noobs</b>that I introduce totally strange RPGs to are happy to be led.

However, they are hungrily looking for any cues they can pick up about "how to do this thing", so leading by example is absolutely vital, both from the GM side and the players' side. Whatever you do, whatever the group does, they're pretty likely to pick up on it and do the same.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_276081">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276081/#Comment_276081" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-15T06:55:06+00:00" title="June 15, 2010  6:55AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 15, 2010 6:57AM by jenskot.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fantastic thread Dave!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I've found is these types of conversations need to be ongoing to varying degrees.

He wants it raw and real!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd for the most part he was fairly consistent about it. Especially when it wasn't his character! But a few times contradictions crept in. In one game an automobile flipped over with evidence trapped inside that they wanted to destroy. The car began leaking liquid and he stood up excitedly and declared "I shoot at the car, sparking a far that causes the gas tank to explode!"<br/>\n<br/>\nI turned to him, "weren't you just telling me about a mythbusters episode where they disproved that!"<br/>\n<br/>\nWe talked about it and he admitted that it breaks his immersion or realism when other people aren't being realistic. When other people are playing, he is the audience and as an outside observer, his suspension of disbelief is important to him. But when he is the actor, he sometimes prefers more escapism than realism without going too far. If he is living the fantasy, then the need for suspension of disbelief lessens especially since he is living the moment... not watching it!<br/>\n<br/>\nVery nuanced!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt also went against what he was adamant at the start of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, I've found nongamers to be a bit more consistent! In <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11593" rel="nofollow">Gaming with garbage men...</a>, the players were very clear about what they wanted and followed through. Far more than I expected! Of course I haven't gamed with them as much so I don't have the same body of experience to draw from. My observation on nongamers could be highly flawed. But it seems the more preplay involved, even just fantasizing about the kind of games you want to play, the more expectations are in play, and the more the group needs to get on the same page. With the Garbage men above, they had very little expectations, they just didn't want to go straight home after work!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_276103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276103/#Comment_276103" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-15T08:51:40+00:00" title="June 15, 2010  8:51AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's an interesting point and it's something that I was thinking when I originally read it.

So Castle X, full of traps, is extremely resistant to infiltration/stealth/puzzle-solving, fairly resistant in response to violence (because the guards are well-trained and organized), but vulnerable to intrigue/diplomacy (because the Duke and the guardmaster are corrupt, and the Duke's wife secretly hates him).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_276315">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jprussell" title="jprussell"><img alt="jprussell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jprussell">jprussell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276315/#Comment_276315" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-16T06:55:11+00:00" title="June 16, 2010  6:55AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, that's an interesting way to go with it, but I had something *totally* different in mind. That's kind of cool that different folks can come up with such different ideas, because what I had in mind went more like this:<br/><br/>Depending on what the players set the dials to, that changes what the GM presents and what is going on in the world right now. So, if they've put lots of stuff into the romance pile, maybe she's not quite so murderous, or perhaps the main plot comes from the tension of her being murderous but romantically involved with the characters, rather than just a bad person to fight.<br/><br/>Or, when going into castle X, if the players have set the infiltration/stealth/puzzle-solving or violence dials high, well, that's the way they get into Castle X (or don't) with the appropriate challenges.<br/><br/>I guess I was looking at the dials as group-consensus builders while you're looking at them as another element of the game-game.

This started with the mention of the "pacing dial", which Dave Berg uses in his game Delve. In that game, player's preferences about the prominence of combat, negotiation, puzzle-solving, etc, DO determine what is present in the game world and how it all plays out.<br/><br/>So, I was assuming we were starting there, and then seeing if I could get anywhere different from that starting point. I'm just throwing in a twist:<br/><br/>* If you're trying to get into the castle, and you ratchet up "violence", the game is going to look like a bloodbath or a dungeon crawl.<br/>* If you turn up diplomacy or intrigue, the game is going to look like an investigation or some kind of sleuth/spy action.<br/><br/>The twist is:<br/><br/>* The GM has somehow decided that one of these is harder than the other. So, the fighting version might have higher difficulty numbers, or a bigger GM budget for challenges, or something similar.<br/><br/>It could used to give thematic unity to different parts of the gameworld, which the players discover indirectly. For example, violence works better at night/against people from the land of Kron/when you're pursuing treasure. And intrigue gets you further when you're on the island of Z.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_276345">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jprussell" title="jprussell"><img alt="jprussell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jprussell">jprussell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276345/#Comment_276345" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-16T09:27:16+00:00" title="June 16, 2010  9:27AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, Paul, I've got you now.

A little bit more tactical, a little bit more of a gamble.

(Example: the types are Puzzles, Relationships, Realism, and Violence.  The game has instructed the players on the precise meanings of these categories -- Puzzles mean actual challenges to player cleverness; Realism refers to real life, not to any genre of fiction; etc.)<br/><br/>Before play, they each hand the GM one token, indicating what they'd like to see in that session.<br/><br/>So now the GM has a pile of tokens that everyone can see.  Play begins.  In the early part of the game, we start slow, setting up the situation, and no tokens are played.  <br/><br/>At some point, the players get to a "What next?" juncture.  They're about to open a new door, or talk to a new NPC, or take some sort of step forward in the fiction.  The GM picks up all the tokens, hides them, selects one, holds out his closed hand with the chosen token concealed inside.  He then narrates the new room or NPC up until a clear sense has been conveyed, and then opens his hand.  "Yeah, she's speaking in riddles, and here indeed is your Puzzle token."<br/><br/>The GM discards that token.  It's out of the game.  He then places all the other tokens back on the table.  <br/><br/>The first player to the GM's left gives one of his 7 remaining tokens to the GM's pile.<br/><br/>This process repeats for each "What next?" juncture, with the token-adding player moving clockwise around the table, so everyone gets a turn.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_276402">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jprussell" title="jprussell"><img alt="jprussell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jprussell">jprussell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276402/#Comment_276402" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-16T12:50:14+00:00" title="June 16, 2010 12:50PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm, David I like that because it's good and simple, easy to keep track of and so forth, and it will trend in particular directions based on the players' decisons on what kind of new tokens to hand in.<br/><br/>But I think the nebulous idea in my head is a little more. . . analog? Fine grained? I dunno. I'm thinking something that the players can generate, rather than necessarily having a limited pool to throw down. Maybe you get violence tokens when you do hyper violent things. Or you get realism tokens when you especially follow reality. So you get these tokens, and they go into some sort of pool that everybody can see. <br/><br/>Now, the hang up I'm running into is that I want these tokens to continue to push the story in their own direction, but if you get violence tokens by being violent and spend them to get bonuses to being violent to get more tokens. . . yeah, there's no interesting counter balance there. <br/><br/>What John did in his Shadowrun hack that got me thinking in this way is that players contributed "money" to a central pool to dictate how difficult an action was. More money = more difficult. At the end of the mission, they got that money as the pay off. But the added wrinkle was that as in-game time ticked by, money got taken away from the pot. <br/><br/>So, I'm trying to think of a way to get a similar vibe, but with multiple vectors of 'story type'. Maybe each token represents a sort of 'experience point' or other advancement that's only good towards its category (violence, puzzles, whatever) or the GM can spend the tokens to create a threat of that particular type.<br/><br/>I feel like the missing piece to balance it out is eluding me. Your system above seems to have that, though.<br/><br/>Sorry for this being so rambly and stream-of-consciousness like, just trying to contribute to the brainstorm!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_276409">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276409/#Comment_276409" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-16T13:25:34+00:00" title="June 16, 2010  1:25PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, another brainstorm:<br/><br/>No GM.  Players and Adversary.  Players' job is to narrate both characters and environment.  Adversary's job is to rate what the players are doing and provide adversity accordingly.<br/><br/>So, I'm the Adversary.  I see a player narrating jump-kicks, I drop a Violence token into the middle.  I see another player making a negotiation personal, I drop a Relationship token.  Everyone can see the tokens piling up, which signals to each player what the other players care about.<br/><br/>The Adversary can spend a token from the central pool at any point to inject adversity of the type indicated by that token.  So I grab a Relationship token and narrate, "Your phone rings.  It's your wife.  She's yelling for help and then is cut off!"  Or I grab a Violence token and narrate how you're ambushed by thugs.  Or maybe I grab both at once and tell you your wife has been murdered.<br/><br/>So the story becomes increasingly about the kinds of stuff the players have been playing.  If the player's reaction to his wife's murer is to get all Sherlock Holmes on it, then maybe the game subsequently veers off in a Puzzle direction... but more likely, if the group's digging it, the Violence and Relationship focus will just keep rolling with some revenge efforts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_276416">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jprussell" title="jprussell"><img alt="jprussell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jprussell">jprussell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276416/#Comment_276416" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-16T13:36:16+00:00" title="June 16, 2010  1:36PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like that a lot!

I think the option exists to hardly bother with pre-game char-gen, too.  Just one statement about them that adds one token, and then the rest comes through play.  Regardless, I think the number of tokens in the middle should stay small at all times so each change to the pile matters.\n<blockquote>If we're gonna go GM-less (mostly), why not make dropping a token in the pile something anybody but the acting player can do?</blockquote>Nah.

If you're adding tokens that'll affect what <i>you</i> wind up playing, that defeats the purpose of <i>indicating through play</i> in the first place.

If Bob knocks a guy over the head with a sap, and Alfred the adversary doesn't think that's so violent, but Charlie does, Charlie can add a token to make clear what kind of behavior he thinks is both 'violent' and worth having more of in the game. <br/><br/>And I don't quite agree that it defeats the purpose of indicating through play, it's just that it's a way of making it more explicit. The reason I proposed not adding tokens for your own actions was precisely to try to foster a shared vision. You don't get to choose if your actions generate tokens, everybody else has a say in that. But then the adversary will throw challenges at you suited to actions that you (and the others) have taken and been judged worth seeing more of.  I'm seeing it more as "Okay, Bob just did something the way I want to be able to do things later, here's a token". I'm basically thinking of the tokens as on-going, continually determined system of flags. <br/><br/>But, it's entirely possible that it'd be a hassle and/or break down some way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_276572">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276572/#Comment_276572" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-17T09:44:36+00:00" title="June 17, 2010  9:44AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alas, I'm currently short on opportunities to try it and find out.
