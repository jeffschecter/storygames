So far we have discussed Fiasco, Downfall, Microscope, and Fate (Fate is no longer an option because I don't have enough time left). Would Fiasco work with 7 players? What other games would you suggest we play? I also have some games that I'm play testing that might work?: Apocalypse World: Dark Age; Freebooting Venus; and Follow. Most everyone in the group has experience with a few "indie" RPGs and Story Games. Oh, and we're scheduled for 3 hours. <br/><br/>What would you recommend as an "easy" first session game (to GM and prepare for) that would work for 7 players that are somewhat experienced?

In my opinion, a great game. But not necessarily the easiest game to explain, facilitate, or play.</li>\n<li><b>Dread</b> (the Jenga one from The Impossible Dream). Horror game with a very "traditional" storyteller GM role, can easily take that many people 'cause they're just more prospective casualties. I've never played it in the intended horror setting, though - only with a WWI scenario of my own devising. Requires preparing a scenario (though the book has a couple).</li>\n<li>Some or some other version of <b>Geiger Counter</b>, by Jonathan Walton. Again, horror movie, people are going to die fast, etc., but no GM role here. But it's been a long time since I've last played it, and I'm really hazy on the details.</li>\n<li><b>Enter the Avenger</b> is also supposed to work for that many people, despite 5 being optimal. 7 players means 2 people are going to sit out a round as pure audience, waiting for their turn. It's slightly trickier than that, though, because some of the roles give a much smaller contribution than others: thus, success depends on how entertaining the Avenger is, everybody taking care that chapters are kept as brief as possible, and everybody actually enjoying some audience time. I would never recommend 8, but 7 is feasible insofar that the people sitting out the first chapter are then getting some spotlight as the Narrator and Suspect.</li></ul>\nEdited to add: I'm pretty sure I've successfully run a few other games as a GM with 6 other players, it's not that crazy a number. <i>Poison'd</i> has to be one.

In fact, it seems I mostly make games that don't choke much - even <a href="http://www.arkkikivi.net/julkaisut/julenius" rel="nofollow">Fellows of the Julenius Archive</a> works fine with a big group.<br/><br/>In general you'll want to look for games that enable hanger-ons (like Fables of Camelot) - odds are that the big group consists of some people who'll be happy to stay in the background anyway, so as long as the game fluidly enables this, the mere fact of having many players doesn't need to mean a huge traffic jam. Another thing that helps is enabling multi-channel play (like Julenius), where players can do multiple things at once, so the group can benefit from having enough people to engage in two or three things at once. A third quality you'll want is when the game is built around group dynamics and cooperative conflicts, so it can easily be 4-vs-4 instead of 1-vs-1 (like Zombie Cinema). The theoretical ideal story game for big groups would have all three of those capabilities, of course <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456741">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456741/#Comment_456741" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-29T17:13:36+00:00" title="September 29, 2016  5:13PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">@Wilhelm</a><br/>Cool, thank you so much for this, I really appreciate it <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Rafu">@Rafu</a><br/>Thank you so much for all these options...I will have some for this time and next time if we don't split up into smaller groups <br/><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">@Eero_Tuovinen</a><br/>Thanks for pointing these out.

The problem with large groups is spotlight time. You can only slice up your 3-4 hours of play time so many ways before the pie slices look like slivers. As GM, aggressively drag players into scenes that they weren't involved in. Any scene with just 1-2 people in it can probably be expanded to fit another player or two.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_456838">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456838/#Comment_456838" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-03T19:54:39+00:00" title="October  3, 2016  7:54PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wonder if there are any games where it's consistently fun to have a whole bunch of characters weighing in on decisions?
