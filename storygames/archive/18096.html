In fact, the Governor had - a couple scenes earlier, and only after being confronted by the Judge Advocate about the matter - announced a plan to put Mr. Valentine in confinement to better protect him, but the critical Question about the murder attempt was posed before the Governor's plan had any chance to come to fruition.<br/>We were confused that the Governor had no possibility to break his oath now, thus de-protagonizing the character. In fact, we made the ad hoc ruling to proceed <i>just as he had broken it</i>, so that he could now fade into the background after his player performed some highly consequential action (she altered one colonial survey parameter). But how would <i>you</i> have handled this?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408598/#Comment_408598" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-09T19:04:42+00:00" title="March  9, 2013  7:04PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>we made the ad hoc ruling to proceed <i>just as he had broken it</i></blockquote>\nI've never played Durance (although I was one of the playtesters, my session fell through due to scheduling problems), but <i>this</i> is how I would want to handle it, intuitively.

Oath broken. Oaths are framed in an active way "I will never" but the practical emphasis in on <i>never</i>, not<i> I.</i><br/><br/>But in a rare case where it becomes impossible to break an oath (I can't think of any but I'm sure it is possible), I'd call that a lucky break for the character. At that point what is most interesting? Are they still compelling to play, even insulated from transgression? If so, awesome. It doesn't really hurt the game.
