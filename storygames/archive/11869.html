Joanna, the blind Puritan girl with unshakable faith has, since day one, had the belief that "God took my sight for a reason." <br/><br/>Last night, Joanna was standing beside her brother Sam as he leveled his rifle at their mother Amias (who turns out to be a sorcerer who uses a mass grave to draw power from) and gets ready to pull the trigger. Amias responds by casting The Fear, which forces everyone to make Steel tests, which they fail.<br/><br/>Everyone, that is, except Joanna. The Fear effects people who can see you.<br/><br/>Amias starts casting another spell to put the whammy on Sam, taking complete control of the situation. Joanna prays to be delivered from this evil and gets a Miracle. All magic in the room is cut off, Sam takes his shot, and Amias falls dead. <br/><br/>I guess God did take her sight for a reason.<br/><br/>(There was a lot more awesome stuff too. Sam got baptized, Zeke became a cold blooded killer, it just rocked. For a session that started rocky and slow, it ended up being one of our best.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_264986">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264986/#Comment_264986" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-01T14:33:57+00:00" title="April  1, 2010  2:33PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Full Light, Full Steam<br/><br/>We made characters.  <br/><br/>I was reading the book and saw that GURPS was an influence and that I had to distribute LOTS OF STUPID FIDDLY LITTLE POINTS in LOTS OF STUPID FIDDLY LITTLE SKILLS.

His balladeer, Pu, is playing loudly on his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipa" rel="nofollow">Pipa</a> to draw the bandits out. The bandits set up an ambush, but half the party notices at the last second and hides. Pu is left standing by himself s the attackers jump out of the trees.<br/><br/>Pu pretends to accidentally break a string, and slings his Pipa to pull out another. The bandits demand his surrender, and move to capture. Pu cheerfully complies, walking forward to meet them with his arms outstretched. He bows his head to the nearest brigand, and intones, "Let me express how great an honor it is to be allowed to surrender to you."<br/><br/>At that moment his companions strike! In a fluid motion, Pu whips out his lutestring and garrots the bandit, holding him helpless as he grins and addresses his companions: "And now I shall allow you the honor of surrendering to ME!"<br/><br/><br/><br/>(They did. Though it might have had more to do with the Chosen of Heaven battling the bandit leader with lightning coursing from his blade.) <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265644">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265644/#Comment_265644" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-05T12:45:13+00:00" title="April  5, 2010 12:45PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite><cite>Posted By: Krippler</cite>Last night of Gothcon I played<a href="http://ytterstadomen.wikidot.com/solsystemet" rel="nofollow">Den Yttersta Domen</a>(The Final Judgement) a game about the second renaissance in the solar system after most of humanity kills itself because of soul plague.</blockquote>\nThe site has plenty about the setting, but nothing about method of play, system, techniques... Could you say anything about that?<br/>The system had three parts.<br/><br/>1. You have a hand of tarot cards and stack them plus your skill value to win conflict resolution (and you can add X cards of a different color if you have value X in a Knowledge). You can also choose to give up but add a condition to the victor. Conflict resolution hardly ever came up, my strict priest tried to arrange a party to delay the trade negotiations while not letting anyone know he was the one throwing it (and the GM gave up with the condition that zealous agents that had infiltrated the mansion were informed) and he tried to see what another character was doing on a hand computer while she tried to hide it (he used discretion and the knowledge arabic to know how the keyboard was set up).<br/><br/>2. Everyone had 6 keys (of which one was their religion). If you played on it hard in a scene you got a token. If you gave another player a token and told them what key it was for they were forced to follow it (or buy off the key, the only thing you gained from buying off a key was it couldn't be triggered so the scenario was essentially it was interesting to see how many of your beliefs you lost).<br/><br/>3. If someone does something awesome anyone says awesome and gives them a token (not one of their own, just a new one). You can spend the tokens on adding facts about characters or the world in general. These are the same tokens that you gain and trigger the keys with.<br/><br/>I think it mostly was the great scenario and the way the characters were set up that did the work (apart from the players), I could ask the writer if he could give me a copy for me to translate it and put up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265734">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265734/#Comment_265734" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-06T05:41:40+00:00" title="April  6, 2010  5:41AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Playing Templars in 1307, using Dogs in the Vineyard.

Contrary to the hate-thread expectations, we had really good time. (Number crunching is fine for theory threads, but in actual play the system really works.)<br><br>Spent the first hour or so explaining the setting from "at first, there were no humans on Thedas" to "and now King Caillan is kinda bored and... sort of hoping for a Blight or something to fight".<br><br>Character generation was 'standard', but a comfortable familiarity for the vets and instantly grokked by the kid.<br/><br/>I had to step out of the room when we got to setting Goals and Ties, and when I came back, the kid was SUPER excited about her "Main Goal", which was for her (city elf rogue) character to find his dalish elf mom. She then went on to explain (breathlessly) how that was WHY he'd learned to be a scout instead of a normal thief, because he thought of what SHE would be like, and tried to be like that, but it was sad, because city elves and dalish elves hardly ever see each other and why would she LEAVE.  (She then went on to draw pictures of all the characters while we played. In color. They weren't half bad.)<br/><br/>That she (and the other players) grokked the setting that well in short order really pleased me.<br/><br/>For "Ties", the players had decided that the mage in the group had been sent out to help track down an apostate mage-on-the-run-from-the-Tower, and she'd recruited or been assigned the others help out.  I went back to my experience with the CRPG and tied all that into Jowan's escape from the Tower and off we went.<br/><br/>Then we played, fought some demon dogs, and enjoyed the stunt system for the fluid action it imparts to what might otherwise be a pretty staid combat system -- getting to describe what your stunt actions looked like was fun for the players and me. We used a grid, and I was pleased by (a) the way it informed play and (B) not having to fuck around with flanking and opportunity attacks and all that yutz.<br/><br/>Good times. We're excited to play again.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266187">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell" title="John_Powell"><img alt="John_Powell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/nP846SDWNCDOK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell">John_Powell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266187/#Comment_266187" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-08T15:35:16+00:00" title="April  8, 2010  3:35PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah - I used hexes for mapped combat, 'cuz that's how I roll, but DA brings the old-timey flavored fun without any pain!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266304">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Albert%20A" title="Albert A"><img alt="Albert A" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://web.mac.com/albertwa/Ryoanji.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Albert%20A">Albert A</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266304/#Comment_266304" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-09T09:04:02+00:00" title="April  9, 2010  9:04AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On the phone:<br/>"Hello?"<br/>"Hello?"<br/>"Who is this?"<br/>"Agent Piper."<br/>"...Are you vermin?"<br/>"...Are you a 40-foot long locust?"<br/>"...No."<br/>"Then no, I'm not vermin."<br/><br/><br/>(Lacuna, natch)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Doyce" title="Doyce"><img alt="Doyce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.average-bear.com/img/dice-c.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Doyce">Doyce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266806/#Comment_266806" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-12T19:20:15+00:00" title="April 12, 2010  7:20PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            More Dragon Age.

There's a little girl whose mind has been opened to the psychic maelstrom in a really bad way, and the Brainer is starting to care for her more than her own parents. The local <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">butcher</span> angel is hogging barter because he's paying to fuck the hardholder's concubine (and the Brainer just paid him to get some meds he needed for the girl), plus it's obvious he's gonna gut the local driver next (I'm looking through crosshairs) The. village has no renewable sources of water.

Fun game, but I think we need at least one expansion to make it shine.<br><br>After that we turned to Mouse Guard. One player was kinda not into it but by the end he was really invested. I tweaked and ran the Trouble at Grasslake scenario from the book. Two mice stupidly engaged the snapping turtle into a fight, and got trashed, luckily my goal for the turtle was nowhere near "eat or kill the mice". Then the Loremouse tried to talk the turtle into leaving, but failed, too. Then they tried again and smoked her back into the lake. Which obviously meant that she came back, angrier and with her turtle husband and trashed the town again, eating all their food. The failures were mostly down to some poor in-game reasoning, poor conflict choices from the players and two very lucky rolls on my side. The next time, the mice will know better (they'll also have more fate and persona to spend). The major of Grasslake called the turtles weapons of mass destruction.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_269552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P" title="Cedric P"><img alt="Cedric P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img39.imageshack.us/img39/7180/opticnerve8s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P">Cedric P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269552/#Comment_269552" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-30T08:00:10+00:00" title="April 30, 2010  8:00AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 30, 2010 9:48AM by Cedric P.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Burning Wheel.
