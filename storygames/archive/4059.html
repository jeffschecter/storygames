Or they could be paired into groups. An R-Map might list their relationship with each other, or their place in the story, their motivations, ot more.<br/><br/>Are they useful?<br/>That's the question I wanted to answer with my contest-thingy. I wanted to see if they could actually be useful (to a GM, to a player, to both), or if they were just more work with no real relevance to the game at hand (like an Actual Play report: AP reports come after play, and thus really don't do anything to the game that was played, unless there was some problem or behavior that was found that the poster wanted to look at in deeper detail).<br/><br/>In the end, I think that they can be useful, at least worth thinking about as "another tool for the toolbox". <br/><br/>The most useful (from my totally subjective POV) R-Map that I saw, when thinking myself as a potential player in the game it was written for, was Blake's Throne War Map, here: <a href="http://www.story-games.com/goodies/rmap/contest/rweb_scarlet_throne.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.story-games.com/goodies/rmap/contest/rweb_scarlet_throne.pdf</a><br/><br/>Basically, it's a graphical map that, as far as I can tell, doesn't contain a single PC (unless the bottom-most person is a PC).  Rather, it quickly summarizes a convoluted political situation in a very graphic way: It hits the eyes, and basically describes in a few seconds something that would have taken a few paragraphs (at least) to summarize using merely words.<br/><br/>For observers of a game (perhaps people reading an Actual Play report), an R-Map can pretty much instantly break down complicated PC/NPC relationships without having to resort to writing it up in text.  This was proved through the majority of the R-Maps submitted. As I've said before, I'm an incredibly high-visual/tactile-kinesthetic low-audial (reading) learner, and seeing new ways of conveying information other than simple words is important to me, personally. In that regard, I think that they're a welcome addition to any hobbyist's toolbox.<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90642/#Comment_90642" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-27T08:00:11+00:00" title="August 27, 2007  8:00AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One more set of observations:  Recently (I planned to submit my own entry but I never got around to "pretty-ing" it) I've been using a hand-drawn R-Map for my bi-weekly With Great Power/Night Watch game.<br/><br/>Basically, I had a few circles on the top left of a landscape-oriented page: These circles are the Night Watch. ("good guys")<br/>I had a few circles on the top right: These circles are the Day Watch ('bad guys")<br/>There were some circles in the middle: These are regular people and unaffiliated Others.<br/>There was one circle at the bottom: Places. Namely, "Annie Starr's", a wharfside diner with the legend "Great Pie".<br/><br/>Two things happened because of that crudely drawn map (which remains in the center of the table during play):<br/><br/>1) When I as GM am trying to think of "What Next?" in terms of what I want to have happen next, what kind of scenes need to happen, I immediately look at the R-Map. I find a few NPCs that haven't seen air-time for a little while, and bring them in. The players look at it when they set their own scenes, or want to make a connection ("I want to talk with a Good Guy, who's in the Night Watch again?" "I want to have an encounter with a Bad Guy. Lesseeee... Day Watch members..."). It's been a great tool to keep things moving, almost like a Dungeon Map.<br/><br/>2) When I need to remember what happened in-game, I usually look back at the R-Map. Kinda like a storyteller will use visual cues to remember bits of the stories he memorizes, looking at the R-Map helps me remember the pieces that played out in the last session. I've got a poor memory, so it helps. :-)<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90652">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90652/#Comment_90652" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-27T09:27:58+00:00" title="August 27, 2007  9:27AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The other thing, of course, is that by having a relationship map, you <i>imply</i> that each PC should have a relationship with each other PC and (depending on how you use it) probably force them to have relationships.<br/><br/>So, by having it there, you're focussing attention on relationships and, by filling it in, you're giving story elements for later.<br/><br/>(Totally obvious point, excuse me).<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90722">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90722/#Comment_90722" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-27T11:43:55+00:00" title="August 27, 2007 11:43AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Complete and utter shill of a little tool I put together for visualizing Relationship maps... <br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://www.wolvesdenproductions.com/NetVis.exe<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's a tool that allows you to create nodes (objects, people, organizations, whatever) and connect them with lines, which can be defined as well. It's not nearly as pretty and graphical as some of the R-Maps in the thread you're referring to, but I think it does a good job of creating a simple, easily read and modified picture. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo bring this back on the topic, I created it because one of my games, Rats in the Walls, uses an R-Map as part of a central mechanic. It is essential to have an R-Map, because you need to know who and what will be affected by different actions in the game. Say, something happens to change one  element, that element's relationships with other elements may change, or connected elements may themselves change. It helps to take the stone-in-a-pool-of-water concept of spreading changes and apply it to interconnected relationships, either between people, concepts, objects or what have you. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo very quickly veer back off topic, the tool I created is in a useful form, but isn't necessarily complete. Having just looked over some of the R-Maps in the other thread, I can already think of things the tool is missing. If anyone wants to use it and has any suggestions, feel free to let me know through whatever means are convenient.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90747">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90747/#Comment_90747" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-27T13:33:46+00:00" title="August 27, 2007  1:33PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can you show us some examples of the maps you've created with your tool, Wolfe?<br/><br/>I have a game in development that requires something that's sort of a descendant of an R-map (I call it a <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3867" rel="nofollow">coolmap</a>), and I'm starting to prospect for ways of creating them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90765">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce" title="Dave Younce"><img alt="Dave Younce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g232/thomastamblyn/Avatars/GoPlayDice.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce">Dave Younce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90765/#Comment_90765" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-27T14:19:53+00:00" title="August 27, 2007  2:19PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike - <br/><br/>Sorry I don't have time at the keyboard to talk more in depth, but this is something I'm totally into, and I like your coolmaps.

On Mike's request, I created the following map in NetVis. It took little enough time to create the nodes. Connecting them took a little longer, as it grew a tad bit more confusing with each connection. After that, it was a matter of shifting them around so that the connections and nodes didn't overlap, so that it was all easily readable. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat it means: The nodes are things that the two characters in the game hate. Each node is listed with the owning character's name in parentheses. The lines connecting them show how one hatred is connected to another, so that if one hatred is changed, it may affect other hatreds around it. <br/>\n<br/>\nOh, forgot to mention in the first post; If you download the program, hit F1 for instructions!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe image is 80% compressed, but is still readable; It is a semi-large file, but not quite so large as some of the R-Maps from the other thread.<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://wolvesdenproductions.com/webhate.jpg                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90795">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90795/#Comment_90795" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-27T15:55:01+00:00" title="August 27, 2007  3:55PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really like an R-Map that's like a dungeon map, as Andy says. "This is the world of the game." If you need something, pick it from the map. If you create something, add it to the map.<br/><br/>Such a thing kills the blank slate feeling that can paralyze a game in its early stages (if you're an improvising GM like me). Several games give you this great tool as part of prep, but not in a visual way. I've taken to expressing all situation prep as a visual R-Map, including Dogs towns, Agon islands, Principia keys/objects, and SotC novels.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90817">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90817/#Comment_90817" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-27T18:01:45+00:00" title="August 27, 2007  6:01PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm working on something that I'm presently calling a situation map, which is yet another descendant of the R-map.  In it, everything that's significant in the game goes on the sitch-map.  In most cases "significant" equates to "has stats" equates to "can mechanically alter the development of the game."  They're all connected by lines that indicate relationships.  Relationships might also be stats (a la Dogs, or GURPS Ally advantages, or whatever).<br/><br/>One of the neatest things about this set up is that you can <em>see</em> conflicts, right there and plain as day, as loops of relationships that are not mutually compatible.  Joe is a Ranger, Rangers kill monsters, Maria transforms into a monster, and Joe and Maria are married.  CONFLICT.  And resolving the conflict?  As straightforward as changing the relationships or removing an item on the chain.  Structurally straightforward, that is -- in the story, it's the big question of whether Joe leaves the Rangers, or disbands them, or counteracts whatever curse makes his wife a monster, or leaves his wife, or lets the Rangers kill his wife.  Whichever happens, the conflict is resolved.<br/><br/>There's another thing, when a loop of relationships are mutually beneficial, that's also interesting.  They're like the opposites of conflicts; I call them synergies.  Joe and Maria is married, Joe serves the King, the King patronizes Maria's art.  There's a tight knot of relationships there that makes everybody in it happy.  This is something that they'd want to protect, and characters would want to create those loops in general.  I'm really excited about these because they may give player characters something proactive and productive to do, rather than just always untangle conflicts from the situation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90818">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90818/#Comment_90818" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-27T18:05:57+00:00" title="August 27, 2007  6:05PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>I'm working on something that I'm presently calling a situation map, which is yet another descendant of the R-map.</blockquote>\nI'd love to see an example of this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90821">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90821/#Comment_90821" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-27T19:02:46+00:00" title="August 27, 2007  7:02PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We'll see if the damn forum will let me post, this time.<br/><br/><a href="http://kallistipress.com/downloads/SitchMap-1.gif" rel="nofollow">Not a conflict</a>.<br/><a href="http://kallistipress.com/downloads/SitchMap-2.gif" rel="nofollow">Now it's a conflict</a>.<br/><a href="http://kallistipress.com/downloads/SitchMap-4.gif" rel="nofollow">More elaborate</a>.<br/><a href="http://kallistipress.com/downloads/SitchMap-5.gif" rel="nofollow">More elaborate, with PC actions in red</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91127">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91127/#Comment_91127" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-28T16:24:29+00:00" title="August 28, 2007  4:24PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ooo, shiny.
