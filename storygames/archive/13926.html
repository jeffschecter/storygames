My first Angel character had sex in the first session (off screen) with an NPC hardholder. My second Operator/Gunlugger never had sex during the game, though it was part of the backstory with other members of his crew. My third Hocus had sex a few times (off screen, again, which is generally how we did things), at least twice with PCs. My fourth character, in a Monsterhearts one-shot, had sex with a PC off screen. Some of that may have been me warming up to both the idea of sex in games and also becoming more comfortable with the folks I was playing with, since I'd only recently moved to Seattle. <br/><br/>However, I've been in a couple different games where people misunderstood the sex moves to apply to rape, which they explicitly do not, according to the official word from Vincent (and I think that's strongly implied in the book too).  This led to some really weird situations where one player was driving towards rape based on a what they assumed was a mechanical incentive and what they imagined was a shared commitment by the group to support that kind of play, while everybody else was frantically looking around at people's faces and making sure everybody was okay with where things were headed.  And sometimes that made the guy pushing towards rape look like a jerk, though I think the confusion often came from that player not having actually read the book, just looking down at their sheet and assuming that "have sex" includes rape (which says pretty awful things about our culture, but that's a whole different topic). Sometimes, as well, this happened between a PC and NPC despite sex moves not always applying to NPCs, so there was other confusion swirling around as well.<br/><br/>There are definitely moves in Apocalypse World that are about violation -- heck, there's the Violation Glove -- but the specials aren't generally about that. There's something interesting going on with the Brainer special + Deep Brain Scan, where the Brainer can essentially get the effect of having sex with someone by invading their brain, though I generally think people interpret that the other way around, where sex lets the Brainer invade someone's brain without much effort.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_315746">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315746/#Comment_315746" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-07T10:48:37+00:00" title="March  7, 2011 10:48AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Maestro's special isn't Sex, but I've used the seduce move. To get my leather pants back from someone I promised them to so they'd let me in their shelter before a "whiteout" - a storm of poisonous spores. The sex was just a bonus. Sure, you can quote me &amp; use my name.<br/><br/>One nice moment from pre-game skinner sex history in our game: some badguys are threatening the skinner and ask the angel, "Don't you two have a thing?" I'm not sure if he was feigning or really being nonchalant, but he said - "Yeah, I fucked her, so?"\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

Maybe I'm derailing the thread. Maybe it's already been talked to death on an AW forum. I'm trying to hold some incompatible thoughts in my head:<br/> * okay, maybe this says something bad about me, but I assumed "sex" included "rape" but I won't let myself feel too bad because dictionary.com defines "sex" as having sexual intercourse and "rape" as forcing someone to have sexual intercourse - the next edition of the book maybe should explicitly say "consensual sex" - that said, it never occurred to any of us to go there in play<br/> * so, rape would be using 'go aggro' or 'seize by force' to coerce sex. but isn't "seduce" also coercing sex (at the very least, with NPC's, if you have the advanced seduce and roll 12+)? Doesn't that make one a sort of evil puppet master character? (Anybody read Bendis' *Purple*?)<br/> * and yet, somehow I'm morally okay with the latter but not the former<br/>Can anyone make sense out of my contradictory thoughts?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_315750">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315750/#Comment_315750" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-07T11:21:58+00:00" title="March  7, 2011 11:21AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 7, 2011 11:22AM by J_Walton.">edited March 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I suspect part of that comes from how you read the rules of the game.  The game says "whenever you and another character have sex," and, the way I use English (whatever the dictionary says), if somebody sexually assaulted me, I wouldn't say "he and I had sex," you know?  I would call it something else.  Coercion definitely happens in play, though, both physically (typically through Go Aggro), emotionally (Seduce or Manipulate), and supernaturally (Brainer, Skinner, and Hocus moves). The way we've been dealing with that is -- I think I saw John do this first -- the MC asks the players: "So... you have sex?" or "So, does that count as sex?" That gives each player a chance to say, "yeah, we had sex" or "no, that was something else; whatever it was, it wasn't sex." That's really a "lines and veils" thing, not something directly derived from the game.<br/><br/>I didn't really mean to imply that other folks are "playing it wrong," though I guess I stated it in those terms, more just bringing up an issue regarding sex moves that had come up in the games that I've been a part of.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_315800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315800/#Comment_315800" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-07T19:45:25+00:00" title="March  7, 2011  7:45PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We used sex moves.

(after being captured by the hocus's cult) I said "he'd defiantly let you go if you had sex with him" Which the player opted to do. <br/><br/>In Olympia, we talk about sexual violence A-LOT. And this was the first game many of us had played where something like this had come up. It was a big deal. We had to do a lot of processing about it. In a way it was great because games can be a safe space to explore topics like this. Also as an MC you need to let your players know what could happen, and make sure everyone is open to the story going there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_315807">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Madrun%20Badrun" title="Madrun Badrun"><img alt="Madrun Badrun" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Madrun%20Badrun">Madrun Badrun</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315807/#Comment_315807" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-07T19:56:24+00:00" title="March  7, 2011  7:56PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been playing a Faceless in a regularly meeting face to face group for about two or three months now.  He finally got around to pulling the trigger and making a real move for the Saavyhead in the crew who he's fallen in love with.  We did the whole "fade to black" thing, but definitely took the time for the Saavyhead to read him like an object, which made for a pretty cool scene as I got to describe a bit of his background and let the rest of the group know a little more about why he's all messed up and weird.  I haven't used his sex move yet, but am really looking forward to it, I love the whole "rising from the darkness" creepy factor.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_315812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315812/#Comment_315812" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-07T20:12:52+00:00" title="March  7, 2011  8:12PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The first game of Apocalypse World I ever played featured a sex move--the Brainer Special. I was playing the Brainer, and I had Unnatural Lust Transfixion. Cybelle was a transsexual slut who loved people and loved to experience them fully. She was in love with the Savvyhead, Jessica. We had stolen/rescued Jessica from the Hardholder Esco, and when he sent his men to get her back, she was terribly wounded in the crossfire. After we were all captured Cybelle ended up seducing Esco with the Unnatural Lust Transfixion in exchange for letting Jessica go, and when her Special kicked in she learned that A) Esco was a good man who genuinely loved Jessica, <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> what Cybelle had done had broken him, and C) his Holding would not survive if he wasn't made whole. The session ended with Jessica returning and effecting healing and reconciliation between the three of them.<br/><br/>I obviously drove play toward this on account of the sex move. The Brainer's move is interesting in that not only is its effect a big fucking deal, there's another move (ULT) that plays into it, meaning that you either have a Brainer who's a "sex build" or you don't.<br/><br/>It's great that the move isn't a straight-up attack. It's...potentially useful, but also leaves the Brainer vulnerable and at the mercy of the MC in terms of what knowledge she gains. I used that to push toward an emotionally raw character arc, full of sexiness and creepiness but also a sort of tenderness. It worked out great.<br/><br/>I definitely wouldn't have happened if I hadn't see that sentence on the playbook about what happens if I have sex. I would've just been "doo-tee-doo, psychic chick, acts creepy, scans people, occasionally jerks their strings." Having a gender of "transgressing" on the sheet definitely enabled the arc as well.<br/><br/>I <a href="http://storybythethroat.wordpress.com/2010/03/31/tragic-trajectories/" rel="nofollow">blogged about it</a> a year ago.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_315813">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315813/#Comment_315813" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-07T20:28:12+00:00" title="March  7, 2011  8:28PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 7, 2011 8:33PM by nemomeme.">edited March 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played in and MC'd a few different Apocalypse World campaigns and games.  Lots of intimate moments but most of them didn't have a lot of sex moves going on in them in spite of the text.  For various reasons, I guess.<br/><br/>In one of the campaigns my brainer used her move a few times and I posted about a couple of those previously:<br/><br/><i>1)  My brainer Brace has a sweet face and soft eyes but too often looks overly desperate for affection. Above the waist is fine enough too but she's crippled and walks only with the assistance of crutches and leg braces.<br/><br/>There's a new cult in the hardhold just came in. They don't know her yet or what she can do, so maybe she's got a chance with one of them. One prospect, Fel, is about her age and catches her eye. She convinces him to come back to her bombed-out apartment, but only at the cost of making a new enemy, Fel's on again off again woman, Tao. It's a price Brace is willing to pay.<br/><br/>When Brainers have sex with another character they automatically do a deep brain scan on them. As Brace climaxes she knows two things. 1) Fel craves the forgiveness of Tao. 2) His lowest moment is having sex with Brace, a decision he deeply regrets.<br/><br/>Her eyes tear up and she starts to say "You can leave if you want to," but she doesn't want him to know she can read him. And it's been so long... She tries to spoon with him and him and he turns away. She closes her eyes.<br/><br/>Oh the fuckery...</i><br/><br/><i>2)  My brainer Brace had sex with the group's savvyhead Gitch. It was the first time she'd been with someone who actually dug her, instead of being repulsed by her leg braces and spooky psychic powers.<br/><br/>So of course I roll a miss on my deep brain scan sex move even though she has a +3 Weird and end up doing one-harm to him during. She loses control and all the pain she'd healed from him earlier (Angel's healing touch) flows back into him. She was crying and saying, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, it's not always like that!" Of course he gets to use his Things Speak sex move and asks, "What's wrong with this (her), and how might I fix it (her)?" Interesting answers follow.<br/><br/>My MC Christian rewards my miss by having Brace wake up not next to Gitch for the pillow talk she was craving, but instead bound in a pitch dark room in an oil refinery, kidnapped by creepy mutants.</i><br/><br/>The brainer's sex move probably tipped the balance for me in deciding to play that kind of character over some of the others that appealed to me at the time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
