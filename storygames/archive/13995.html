Many of those issues come from having spent a lot of time within the tabletop roleplay medium and not understanding the differences between that and the larp medium.<br/><br/>The biggest issue I see repeated over and over - the GM expects to be able to play the big NPC bad guy and handle game logistics at the same time. Because in a tabletop game you usually do that. But it tends to work out horribly in larp. You need <br/><br/>The tabletop equivilant to this common issue is the common GM problem of viewing themselves as the primary writer of the story with the players as puppets within his story.<br/><br/>But you seem to want to approach this from a design level, rather than an implementation level.

Sony Interactive just released another MMO. This one is about DC Heroes. The game is, for lack of a better review, abysmal. There is a less than 20% retention of new users after just a MONTH of release. For an MMO, this is bad. Bad. Bad. Sales numbers aside, a SUPER HERO MMO is a bad call. It is not the medium someone wants to play a superhero. It is not thematic. It is not fun. (someone is going to bring up city of heroes and remind you it came out during a time when there were FEW if any MMO options). Running around seeing 20 other supermen fighting 20 other Lex Luthors is just dumb.<br/><br/>Unless the game were Crisis on Infinite Earth and there was not only a reason for the 20 supermen, but a way to fix it. Moving on.<br/><br/>If you asked me to design a DC SUPERS MMO, I would do the following before design.<br/>Who am I? (you're green lantern, wonder woman, etc.)<br/>What am I doing? (fighting crime, saving the world, etc.)<br/>How has this story/message been presented before? (comic book, cartoon, etc.)<br/>How does this translate into a new medium? (well.... playing around hoping to find crime is not fun, nor thematic to the DC Universe.)<br/><br/>Instead of an MMO off sandbox gaming, the DC game should have been about "Issues." You go into "Issue #1" for Green Lantern and you explore the origin story of Hal Jordan. Once that adventure is complete, you move on to "Issue <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>." While inside Issue <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, you can do anything you want to make his origin your own, with all kinds of superheroes inside that issue, but you will NEVER encounter another Green Lantern.<br/><br/>If you then asked me to design the DC Heroes iphone game, it would not be angry birds with Hawkgirl.<br/><br/>[All that said, if you make a game and it sells, who the **** cares what my opinion on design is.]<br/><br/>There's nothing wrong about wanting to make an RPG or a card game about spitting watermelon seeds (for instance), but the mechanics and reward system for each will be wildly different.<br/><br/>I have Ben's Microscope. The concept is amazing and I've always wanted to see this game made. I'm glad someone did it. But Ben didn't try to make the medium do something it's not supposed to. And in all fairness, many story games blur the line between RPG and Board Game. Which is an exciting arena to play in.<br/><br/>Getting back to my original post, modern video games are not designed, they are developed. In the industry, these are two very different steps in the process. Someone concepts a game, someone starts working on the "sandbox" the game will be played in, someone starts making the motion graphics, and then eventually someone says, okay... what's the story here? what are these characters doing? There are exceptions, but you can't tell me that the new Wolverine game was "designed." It's a derivative game based on a model that sold well before. So. Why change it.<br/><br/>I really wasn't expecting to talk this much about it. I just saw that Mario video. It made me laugh and then say. "Hey. Yeah. If they were designing that game today, it would not be the fun old side-scroller we grew up with. What ever happened to design?"<br/><br/>That's all. You are free to go back to ignoring this post.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_317479">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jared%20A.%20Sorensen" title="Jared A.

That's because they play the 100 best songs out of the 10,000 songs from the era. They've let all the less great stuff filter down and they're just playing the best stuff over and over. If you'd listened to a rock radio station in 1978, it would not have sounded like KLSX did in 1995 (before they started playing post-70s music).<br/><br/>There have been lots and lots of crappy games designed since games first started. If you want to look at "repeating a gameplay style and just changing a few features" you just need to look at all the Hack clones that started in the ASCII age and continued into the early graphics era. Those were some of the earliest computer games and they start right into the phenomenon you're complaining about today.<br/><br/>Likewise, lots of RPG design is crap. Lots of games are designed to be similar to some previous design just because it's familiar, just like some of the crappy repetitive songs you hear on the radio. Some crap games have an amazing little piece in them that can be picked out and remixed in something else, not unlike a DJ sampling an awesome riff out of a crappy old song.<br/><br/>But knowing something is bad doesn't, by itself, help you make something less bad.<br/><br/>So if all you want to do is say "most stuff people make is crap" that's fine, and I'll agree with you. But I'd be more interested in suggestions on how to make story games less crappy, either at the design stage or the AP stage.<br/><br/>What are the essential elements of story gaming that a designer or GM or player should keep in mind in order to encourage more good experiences and avoid more bad ones?<br/><br/>In particular, are there some elements that are often ignored, leading to crappy games?<br/><br/>I'll put one out there to start - granular game economies have little meaning in tabletop games. They're hard to implement well by the GM.<br/><br/>They can be done well in medium to large larps, especially ongoing campaigns. But it's hard to implement a meaningful game economy until you have about 30 players involved. If you have less than that, you can have resource trading of larger blobs - the types of things where people have maybe 3-10 widgets to manage (like points that count as "influence" or tradable mana points that power your special abilities, for example). But a granular economy (one where, for example, you pay for a drink with a small but meaningful piece of currency) doesn't work until you have a certain minimum number of interacting people. <br/><br/>In my experience with larp, the critical mass is around 30 players. But that number varies a bit depending on the style of the game and the players in it. A more PvP oriented game can have a working economy with a few less players, if they're interested in it. But a game with more of a PvE focus will find they have much less need for a granular economy, generally speaking. <br/><br/>Of course, there are other factors, such as what you actually DO with the economy. If it's just another vector for pacing slow power growth, then it's less likely to be interesting. You're probably better off just occasionally giving the players a new piece of gear periodically and skip the economy thing.<br/><br/>But in tabletop games, money is hard to do well, unless you make it a strong focus point of the game (Metropole Luxury Coffin does this, IIRC). In most games where it's attempted, you have some version of the D&amp;D gear list. And it's crap.<br/><br/>Better off handling it through an Edges and Hinderances type of angle. Either you're normal or you're poor or you're rich. And make sure you handle it in a way where the players don't take a token rich person in the party to finance them all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
