The Master could be some executive who personalizes the culture, greedy, ruthless, and corrupt. The villagers would be the hapless investors, other workers, maybe even federal investigators.<br/><br/>The Minions would be the overpaid workers in the financial institutions, the analysts, the consultants. Their Beyond Human traits could be things like "Can pass any bonds off as good investments, as long as no one calls him on the bull" or "Can convince clients to invest in anything, unless it's raining" and so on. Below Human could be traits like "Cannot resist buying luxury goods unless out of town" or "Is tongue-tied around the opposite sex unless the person flashes a smile."<br/><br/>Overall it would be a pretty Villainy-centered game unless the line between Violence and Villainy were redrawn and possibly renamed, like Public Farce and Private Deception. The former would include giving a brazenly false presentation on the expected default rate of subprime mortgages, while the latter would be clamping down on your conscience in the privacy of your office to rate some very questionable assets highly.<br/><br/>The endgame is the most problematic, since it's not like little old grandmothers who lost their life savings and their repentant financier grandchildren brought down Wall Street. The fundamental flaws in the "investments" took care of that. Rather maybe the endgame could be something that happens post-bust (maybe the bust is triggered when a Minion's Love is greater than Fear + Weariness?), with the Minions exposing the Master's misuse of bailout money and blatant deceptions over the ears. Evidence of white-collar crime would be juicy, too. Overall the endgame would be more of a covert-phone-calls-to-journalists-and-investigators affair than a pitchforks-and-torches thing, and could take place over a course of weeks or even years. Not that a few sordid murders along the way would be out of place, of course.
