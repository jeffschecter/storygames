For the most part it was 14 or 15, with Intelligence and Charisma being fuzzy. So since if you're not making an ability check, there's no mechanical difference between an 11 or a 14 (for the most part), I decided to see what it would look like if 14 were considered average.<br/><br/>11 Awful<br/>12 Poor<br/>13 Mediocre<br/>14 Average<br/>15 Fair<br/>16 Good<br/>17 Great<br/>18 Superb<br/>19 Fantastic<br/>20 Epic<br/><br/>I figure that looks pretty good. If you're good in an ability, you succeed ~75% of the time, which is a nice number you have. Also, unless you've got a score in the Mediocre-Fair range, you've got some sort of modifier so you're benefitting from your score, and you can actually tell the difference between them beyond a 5% difference in an ability check.<br/><br/>1d6+12 produces this range nicely as well, giving you 11-20 with certain races, and it's also the results most people were satisfied with. It makes sense to look at things this way instead of 10-11 being average, which they very well may be, but they're not average for heroes, they're borderline abysmal. Also, just looking at letter grades that are handed out, if you only succeed 55% of the time, you're almost a failure, since there's about as much a chance that you'll fail as succeed. There's really no need to use the bottom end of the spectrum, or differentiate. 17-18 matches up with A, 19-20 with A+, 15-16 with B, 13-14 with C.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
