So, for HSH, is replaced hit points with, essentially, faith points. Conflicts arise that put your faith at risk and the damage comes off your faith points. If you run out of faith points, you retire the character, i.e., character "death". For my Gen Con Bullseye game, I'm doing <i>24</i> and using Time as the fluid attribute. So, the PCs can't be hurt or killed, but they can run out of time before the suitcase nuke goes off. Playtests so far have proven very exciting, as changing the focal attribute changes the focus of play as one might expect. In the latter example, the PCs don't worry about getting killed, they worry about taking too long. This leads to more exicting attempted maneuvers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/orklord" title="orklord"><img alt="orklord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nBSO1M13J7CVK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/orklord">orklord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70342/#Comment_70342" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-18T16:48:40+00:00" title="May 18, 2007  4:48PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite><br/>- I like the idea of making a D&amp;D world where dungeon delving is part of the culture.

I find Iron Heroes to be a particularly appealing D&amp;D variant for the kung fu idea.  Regarding long battles, I agree it can get kinda bad at high levels.<br/><br/>My other crazy D&amp;D idea isn't quite so radically crazy.<br/><br/>1.  A mystical explosion rocks a major town, destroying a city block and everyone inside.<br/>2.  The party are spirits of people who died in this explosion who have refused to pass on, and through shared strength gained the power to inhabit the corpses of those who died in the explosion.<br/>3.  Every character has an "agenda"; the thing that needs doing that makes his spirit cling to the physical plane.<br/>4.  No member of the party can find rest until <b>every</b> partymember's "agenda" has been settled.<br/>5.  A player gets +5 (level dependent) to any d20 roll (skill check, attack roll) that directly advances his personal agenda.<br/>6.  The PCs do not have their original bodies, and the bodies they do have access too are obviously dead.  This complicates interactions with humans.<br/>7.  Anytime a PC is reduced to 0 hp, he is destroyed, but will awake in a new body back at the graveyard within minutes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70737">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70737/#Comment_70737" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-21T07:34:17+00:00" title="May 21, 2007  7:34AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like going on tangents with D&amp;D game terms.<br/><br/>Alignment: Your attributes change depending on your horoscope.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70775">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70775/#Comment_70775" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-21T09:33:58+00:00" title="May 21, 2007  9:33AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DanielSolis</cite>I like going on tangents with D&amp;D game terms.<br/><br/>Alignment: Your attributes change depending on your horoscope.</blockquote>\nDamn those evil Scorpios!

I've got another game idea where your character is an adventurer, but you don't play out adventures: you buy them with experience points, and they become usable traits.

The founders of the city were several "evil" races who were tired of being attacked by adventurers every time they went out looking for food, so they went to the ass end of the world and founded their own village.  Of course, their city turned out to be right on top of some ruins and became an important port, so it grew.  Then the drow came up and claimed a portion of the city.  And a mind flayer started a gang.  And that gang ended up fighting another gang of orcs who inhabited the flooded portion of the city and ran around with boots of water walking...<br/><br/>I guess most of this has been done before and can be found within d20 Modern, but this was 15 years ago, so it was pretty unique stuff then.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71029/#Comment_71029" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-22T07:30:59+00:00" title="May 22, 2007  7:30AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: orklord</cite>I once ran a D&amp;D campaign set in an all-humanoids city.</blockquote>\nI ran a similiar game where the players landed in a city on the back on an undead turtle that was ruled by evil bastards, entirely like yours but making a whole lot less sense.<br/><br/>When I read The Scar by China Mieville, I got deja vu.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_71096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71096/#Comment_71096" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-22T10:58:40+00:00" title="May 22, 2007 10:58AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran a game where the goblinoid race (they were one "race" with variations that included goblins and hobgoblins and ogres and stuff) had built a giant wall to keep the damned humans and demihumans out.

Bonuses to a roll, up to some cap.  <i>Adventure</i>-style edits and declarations.  Hit points are the degree to which you can say what happens to your character, usually in a specific fashion.  Alternate uses would be different ways to influence your character or the world.  You can take cues from any other game where similar things are permitted.<br/><br/>I think D20 Star Wars let you spend hit points for force powers, and they had super-cool alternate HP rules I've seen in a few places: Hit points gained from increased levels specifically have nothing to do with physical integrity.  Thus, when you lose them, you still haven't been "hit," and you can recover them swiftly between scenes.  If there had been more ways to spend them for luck and bonuses to rolls and the like, I might have been happy with it as a representative of Star Wars gaming...<br/><br/>Spycraft (and Stargate, based on it) had stunt dice, which were a resource that were used to do all kinds of interesting things, like confirm criticals and define gadgets.<br/><br/>Someone who's played Buffy could say something about...whatever those points were called.  Fate?
