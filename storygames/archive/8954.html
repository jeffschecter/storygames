So saying that "everything is a Bang" is a category error - sure, it might be that you can respond to Bangs and other events in the same way, but that is just a discussion of how you respond to events in play, and has little to do with what the GM is doing on his side of the dialogue. Everything is a Bang only if everything is a GM-prepared situation intended to evoke thematically weighty responses. As GMs I think we all know that this is bullshit - we don't prepare everything in the game as Bangs; for one, we don't prepare what the players say to each other, and we certainly all know games where no Bangs are prepared at all.<br/><br/>As for the actual point, I more or less agree that it's a potentially fruitful attitude for a player to be on the lookout and react to events of play like they were Bangs and had meaning. From the player viewpoint a Bang is just GM-communication like everything else, after all, so unless the game explicitly has you flag the Bangs, the player can't know for sure which communications are such and which are not. And it doesn't even matter from your viewpoint - you're just looking for opportunities to do meaningful things in the story, you don't care whether the GM intended this or that piece to be a Bang or not.<br/><br/>But twisting this into "everything is a Bang" is just confusing; it'd be better to say that "a player should always keep his eyes open for meaningful opportunities".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197782">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197782/#Comment_197782" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-19T09:17:40+00:00" title="March 19, 2009  9:17AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kaare Berg</cite><em>The players react because participation is excpected</em>.</blockquote>\nYa say that like it's a bad thing.

One player starts on stage, the other starts off. The offstage player walks on and says, "It's Tuesday." The onstage player must react. Or some might say overreact. You radically over-accept the offer that it's Tuesday. (Common reactions include extreme horror, delight, confusion, etc.)<br/><br/>I've been known from time to time in games to respond to non-offers in an "It's Tuesday" fashion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
