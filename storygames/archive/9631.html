Patience, plz! ^_^]<br/>Hey gang,<br/>I've been into the Forge's whole trip for a few years now, and I've kept busy lately by a) looking for design theories other than the Big Model and b) close-reading critiques of the Big Model. As a result of these two goals, I've been thinking "What distinguishes the Forge, exactly?"<br/>Thus, I've come to think that player agency is <i>the </i>big deal, the worth-writing-home-about idea that the Forge and others have given us (can't speak to others' experience, but I know that protagonization is just the bee's knees to most long-time Forgies). Take Creative Agenda, Conflict Resolution, various techniques and ideas, even the Big Model itself, and put them all next to each other in a row, and a concerted effort towards player agency leaps out at me. <br/>It's been argued that Robin Laws' player-types are a proto-version of the Creative Agenda; I disagree. Seems to me that, without very firmly insisting on player agency and protagonization, the CAs really are just more slots to fit into; this isn't a bad thing, but we've already had a looong time to reap the benefits of that angle on things. I think Creative Agenda *points at* the importance of player agency; *that* is what takes games to another level.<br/><br/>Of course, playing in a new way will create new problems and opportunities. Once you make room for some agency, the CAs make more sense - it's about the kind of game we're all agreeing to play together, and many of us favor some kinds of games over others. Not in an "I'm a Gamist!" sort of way; that's much too narrow (for many of us) to map what's really going on at the table. But it's still a useful distinction to make about <i>games</i>: if you sit down for a gripping, nuanced tale, and use <i>Donjon</i> to run it, then the rules probably won't cover relationships and emotional connections in any meaningful way. If anything, they discourage that sort of thing simply because they are a total non-priority in the design.<br/><br/>Arguably, because <i>Donjon</i> is a Forge game, from the early years of the Big Model, it's been designed in a way that can appear "narrow" to mainstream gamers - it's Gamism through and through, so Clinton R. didn't try to put any kind of "here's how to have a big, moving story" advice (I'm looking at you, White Wolf). You see that kind of catchall approach in mainstream games - the bit about how to win at stuff (not endgame mechanics; just straight-up Challenge rules, rather), the bit about how to tell a good story (usually GM-only notes; with little player agency available, the players are not expected to even try to do this directly), and the dozens or scores of pages written to accurately portray the setting (alternately, a sprinkling of extra rules-details throughout guarantees the "crunch" to which we're accustomed). <br/><br/>I guess at this point I should make the standard "If you have fun, then that's just fine" point - I really mean it. And, given my next bit, I feel the need to just point that out.<br/>Anyway - once we have agency and we know why we're at the gaming table, we might realize that we don't want the same things. Again, this isn't about the players as individuals; it's about the group, in that moment and with that exact game, deciding (aloud or otherwise) this is what we're on about, this is why we're here. Given that we've all been thoroughly exposed to the "hybrid" model, taking a stab at something more focused could be the only way to start really enjoying RPGs. <br/>I'm not too adept at "reading" the meta-process going on in a game, <i>while the game's in progress</i>, so it's hard to say if I've ever observed a "functional" hybrid (i.e. one that doesn't trip all over itself trying to do too much). I know that most mainstream RPGs have rules for stuff I really don't care about (the minutiae of combat, especially gear; not to mention minutiae in general), but that comes down to more of a crunch-tolerance than anything, I suppose. It could well be that the biggest problem is not the Agenda of the game/group at all, but rather deprotagonization. Dysfunctional hybrids are full of flotsam, "ballast" rules that are there to make the game meet the standard thickness and weight that the average gamer (including me) instinctually perceives to be a "proper" or "real" game. <br/>To continue the nautical analogy, let's point the rudder in the right direction, towards the Agency Isles, and only *then* can we start getting up a good head of speed by tossing out the excess weight. <br/>So. Big point: if we're happy and we know it, ignore Zac *clap clap* <i>but</i> if you're not, chances are good that a great first step would be to play yourself some games with high player agency. Most games put almost all their credibility in the dice (or cards, or whatever; randomness itself is the source of authority) or the GM (in the form of GM fiat and "GM has the last say"), which means the players are there to ... what, exactly? If they enjoy this role, great! If not (like me; I hated being a "neutered" player), then they need to see what else is out there. <br/>Once that happens, <i>then</i> we can go back to the occasionally-silly arguments about defining Creative Agenda and so on.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213776">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213776/#Comment_213776" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-21T18:57:09+00:00" title="June 21, 2009  6:57PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            been there done that, still more or less where you began.

You could equally argue it the other way round: if you're unhappy with games with player agency, because they require you to be creative all the time, try games with clearly defined roles like D&amp;D.<br/><br/>In part, Zac, I think you're quoting from the Big Indie Gaming Myth: where GMs are bad, D&amp;D makes people unhappy because it's dysfunctional and books are thick because...well...that's bad too.

Secondly, neat insight about the sociability of the Big Model - I'll have to check out the Process Model, but it sounds like you're onto something! <br/><br/>Graham, I think you make a solid point - and if you're unhappy with games that push player agency, then yeah, D&amp;D might be more your speed! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Secondly, I actually do happen to be one of those people who feels those, call 'em "stereotypical" feelings that got me into indie games.<br/><br/>I don't see GMs as bad per se, but yeah, the conventional GM role can be irksome. I don't think D&amp;D makes people unhappy; like I said, there's a lot of rules I would jettison because I don't use them/don't wish to use them. The word "dysfunctional" is really judgmental, and I'm going to file my use of it under "well, that IS how we phrase it at this website I go to...". That's kind of a cop-out, I know. <br/>But, well, IMO it *is* dysfunctional to have to learn so many rules, to pay so much just to get the core books, to flip through the darn things so often that play hiccups along, especially during combat... I once, briefly, found a very smooth, fun way to run it (3.0, to be exact) that didn't shy away from any rules (just employed lots of "indie" techniques like Kickers), and we made extensive use of the <i>Hero Builder's Guidebook</i> to get a random-generated start for ourselves. It was great! Well, except that after four sessions, one of my players (out of two) decided he was in it for the combat system, and since we were doing lots of other things, too, he was finished with this campaign. Blech, kind of a whiny player anyway, but it stinks that he wouldn't, I dunno, give me a chance to appease him or something. What I saw as flotsam (attacks of opportunity? meh) he saw as the core of the process - to him, it was all about setting up the next fight with some plot justification. <br/><br/>D&amp;D made me happy, once *wipes away a tear* and then a player who wanted the "authentic" experience broke up our group. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> My gaming heart's still broken! The BIGM has always been part of my experience; I don't player-hate on D&amp;D, but it's not my preferred style of game, and I really am hung up on the importance of player-agency experimentation. Ha, truth be told, I've GMed way more than I've played, and that's not my favorite thing, either. Working on that one, though - checking out a local RP club one of these days...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213872">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DevP" title="DevP"><img alt="DevP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/818/nB2L0MAZS1OU2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DevP">DevP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213872/#Comment_213872" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-22T09:38:05+00:00" title="June 22, 2009  9:38AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think functional/dysfunctional has to invoke some kind of basically good/bad distinction to be meaningful (because these words have those connotations).

There is no 'GM story' to tell, so that is no longer a way of getting 'sidetracked'." For that matter, if we have player agency in our game, the GM is there to run with material the players provide him, and no longer has to just hope they like what sort of scenarios he devises. It's a play style that spreads the creative heavy lifting to the rest of the group, rather than just on the GM or the die results. Alternately, if players feel like their decisions don't matter, then players don't have agency, not in a meaningful way. [I actually amended the original version of this paragraph to include the fact that the <i>players</i> must feel deprived for there to be any actual problem or dysfunction going on. Otherwise, yeah, I'd just be dictating how people should play. That first bit is my personal definition; the second bit is a concession to fairness and diversity of play groups "out there"]<br/><br/>Like Joshua said, sometimes people feel like they're the GM's audience, and sometimes they don't like it. I don't like that feeling at all, from a player <span style="text-decoration: underline;">or</span> GM perspective. The rest of my definition falls under "what Joshua just said". ^_^<br/><br/><i><a href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">@Destriarch</a>:</i> Yeah, I need to apologize for being overly broad, or coming across that way. I actually meant "Forge Theory" when I said "indie" in the title of this thread, and that's unfair and excluding to everybody who's not into that kind of thing. My bad. Logos7 was spot on about that. <br/><br/><i><a href="/forums/profile/Joshua">@Joshua</a>:</i> I would disagree about D&amp;D and agency, at least in the attached gaming culture, the tone of the rules, and a lot of the text. For one thing, most people learn to do exactly what Robin Laws thinks/thought constitutes a "good GM" by reading the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>. Again, sure, if folks are happy with what they've got, great! I realize that some of us Forgies, including me, have at times been just as exclusionary as the most partisan mainstream gamers about this issue. That being said, I think a way to frame my thinking here is "I want games that GMs would want to play". Basically, something that doesn't necessarily chop down the creative power you have, but pushes it into the Protagonist mold instead of keeping it in the Fifth Business mode (an opera term I heard from the Forge. Think a hands-off, supportive GM, and you've got it ^_^)<br/><br/>Komradebob, as far as fiction-level and player-level stuff is concerned, that's a pretty popular line of thinking about game design these days, yeah. In a nutshell, without a lot of illustrations, it goes like this: to avoid moments where the game seems to sputter out, the following needs to happen (using D&amp;D as an example) --&gt;<br/>- the dice results need to affect both mechanical stuff (hit points, etc.) and the fiction (the orcs see their leader die, and decide to retreat). This already happens, generally. <br/>- the fiction needs to affect the dice results (your wife is being carried off by the wererats! You get +2 to hit!). This is an official D&amp;D3.0 "GM fiat" bonus/penalty that can be added to any roll. I believe it to be underused. <br/>- there needs to be some way for players to create "effective" fiction ("Hey, GM, this guy has every reason to trust me. Can I get a +2 bonus on this check?" "Sure!"). Players need to have input on the use of the +2/-2 rule if they are going to be something other than a GM-audience. <br/><br/>This doesn't *have* to mean explicitly using rules that say "let the group decide" instead of "the gm has the final say". All it means is that we should make the most of our dice-rolling, and draw inspiration for things to happen in response to dice results; secondly, we should make the most of our fiction, and infer bonuses and penalties to rolls and such if the fiction is changing circumstances. Opening up the table for suggestions (or assertions, if you want more power-sharing with the players) will start creating a situation where the dice and the narrative "talk to" each other, and we can get a lot more mileage out of what we're doing at the table. This isn't anything that Vincent Baker isn't saying, but it's my super-brief, two-paragraph version of it, sans diagrams.<br/><br/>Joshua, or anyone else familiar with this theory-concept, am I on point with this description?

Just sayin']<br/>Hey, Matt, good call!<br/>I absolutely agree with you. If you're referring to the examples of shoving player agency into D&amp;D3.0 (which is what I was using in my example), I suppose what I advocate is adding on social-context rules about Kickers and whatnot, rather than modifying anything in the game text.<br/>'course, a lot of mainstream game texts explicitly tell you to have a house-rule-heavy attitude about playing (WoD's "Golden Rule" for instance), and to me, that's both a historical tradition and an admission that the game has some rules that the designers don't think are very fun; whether they think this consciously or not is a separate question. Or, well, it could just be an admission that the degree of simulation a group aims for is variable; I hope more games take a page from Burning Wheel and explicitly make it a rule that much of the rules is, technically, optional. <br/>Rather than have lots of rules in the sort of scattergun approach to rule design (which is heavy on faithfulness to the simulation at hand), I definitely prefer something that's shorter and more to the point about how play should look. And yes, there can absolutely be lighter, more nimble games out there that hold the simulation as the highest priority; to my mind, they're the sonnets to standard games' epic poems (more economy of language, essentially). It seems like, beyond a certain level of handling time and intricacy of mechanics, the Golden Rule (or something like it) crops up as an unconscious safety valve against the sheer stream of rules and information. <br/><br/>A really purpose-driven game design, also, for that matter, can do things like establish very clear play-roles (this is what players do; this is what GMs do; etc.) so as to achieve a more precise vision of play. I'm trying to remember the last time I read a mainstream game's mechanics with the same level of care and thoroughness as, say, <i>Polaris</i> or <i>Sorcerer</i>; knowing that the mainstream designer probably figures "you 'know' how to play".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_213986">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes" title="frozenwastes"><img alt="frozenwastes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/062/nIVJF3PC5XJ0G.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes">frozenwastes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213986/#Comment_213986" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-23T00:49:09+00:00" title="June 23, 2009 12:49AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 23, 2009 12:49AM by frozenwastes.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zac in Davis</cite><i><a href="/forums/profile/Devp">@Devp</a>:</i>By "player agency" I mean "the players are the people who push the game in new directions, by the decisions their characters make.

Furthermore, these approaches are all techniques and can be applied to games outside of those we'd consider embracing the Right to Dream.<br/><br/>In the D&amp;D4e game I run, we use a combination of intuitive continuity and punctuated story after/story before sessions.  As well as a nice dose of bang driven play.  We take breaks throughout the session to recap the plot (which is to say, create story after) and talk about it's implications (setting up stuff in terms of entire group story before).  One of my self-appointed roles as the DM is to toss bangs at players.  Some of my players are now getting comfortable enough with it to toss bangs at eachother.<br/><br/>If I were to talk about the game in terms of creative agenda, I'd say we are definitely squarely in the Right to Dream territory, supported by D&amp;D4e's awesome challenge-meeting mechanics and techniques like bangs normally associated with Story Now! type play.<br/><br/>As far as relating this to player agency goes, I am very much invested with incredible power in social terms at that game.  The group decided that one of the DM's primary roles will be to ensure that we "get it right" in terms of the goals of The Right to Dream.  I can override anything at any time if I feel it breaks from our agreed upon canon.<br/><br/>Do the players have their agency in such a game?  Where I have a veto that can only be overridden if 4 out of 5 players disagree with me?  The parallels to the relationship between the legislative and executive branches of some governments should be obvious.<br/><br/>From a different angle entirely, we could also talk about the emphasis on player agency in indie designs as a social phenomenon.  The result of Story Now! being the hotness among the indie game design online community.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213992">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213992/#Comment_213992" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-23T02:08:19+00:00" title="June 23, 2009  2:08AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Zac, could you give an example from your play experience that illustrates your points about play agency?<br/><br/>Because the Forge is about lots of things, but it's <i>definitely</i> about actual play.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_214020">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

I've been trying to get my players to grok conflict resolution, and oddly enough, they didn't really notice that I was employing it for the first few months. <br/>In any case, a Greek heroine, Apollonia, was checking out a Persian warship that had been anchored and then abandoned off the coast of Sparta. She's looking for the women the Persians took captive when they raided Helos, where the heroine had been stationed with the Spartan army. Anyway - I describe the cargo hold, and the crew quarters nearby, and my player, Katie, asks me, "Can I roll something to see if I find anyone?"<br/>I reply, "Sure. Do you want to find anyone?"<br/>She looks at me quizzically. "Yes?"<br/>"Okay, roll [something or other]." She does so, and succeeds. "I guess you found somebody."<br/>"Okay, cool."<br/>[I describe a harried, half-starved woman who has to be coaxed like a frightened animal from behind the bed.]<br/>Her character asks the woman her name. I sit there and think for a moment, stumped. Katie blurts out, "Larissa? That's the only Greek woman's name I can think of."<br/>"Did you say that in character?" I ask.<br/>"Oh, sure. I just the word 'Larissa', though."<br/>"Okay. The woman nods at you, and says that you can call her that. Clearly it's not her real name."<br/><br/>You can see that I used dice rolls and table-talk to invest the player with authority, at least for selected moments. I see this as more "genuine" play - rather than me deciding what's going on secretly, in my head, and acting like it's objectively true, I put it to the table: what does everyone think should happen? Alternately, if I have a clear idea in my head, I might ask, "Here's my idea. Is everyone cool with that?"<br/>I don't constantly ask for permission in this way. But the general style of our OOC conversations during play is one of building consensus and sharing narrative responsibilities. <br/><br/>Nathan, I'd say that your players are definitely invested with some kind of authority - it sounds like the group talked pretty openly about the social contract for the campaign, and decided together that the GM would be the custodian of the Dream; someone who makes sure the Dream keeps happening in a particular way. Granted, everybody has their own internal vision of the SIS, but if you have one person in charge of it, and that's what you're going for, that sounds like overall agency, if not moment-to-moment. I say that because their input was requested and gotten in that very major way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_214100">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes" title="frozenwastes"><img alt="frozenwastes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/062/nIVJF3PC5XJ0G.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes">frozenwastes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214100/#Comment_214100" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-23T15:47:37+00:00" title="June 23, 2009  3:47PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C. Newman</cite>We take breaks throughout the session to recap the plot (which is to say, create story after)</blockquote><p>This is neat.</p>\nIt came as a result of the group not being happy with Story Now! type games.  We're all very much the kind of people to geek out on high concept premises that appeal to us.  We play In A Wicked Age from time to time because of how the elements produced by the oracle appeal to us in that very way.  Then play starts focusing on the character's desires and interests.  Sure, we get the rising action, climax, resolution thing, but often the appealing concept is changed pretty drastically as a result.  To use the example oracle from the rules, the young woman betrothed to the stone harvest god pretty much loses that identifying concept by the end of the session.<br/><br/>I guess we look at some elements of situation more as a piano key to be played rather than something to drive conflict.  Too much agency related to plot (like narration rights for an entire conflict) feels like ripping the key right off the piano and chucking it at the audience. <br/><br/>Strangely enough, I think we all feel we have more player agency with a task resolution system rather than a conflict resolution system.  At the very least, figuring out if what the character does succeeds slows the pace compared to figuring out if they get what they want.<br/><br/>Which I guess brings me to my point which I meandered around for the entire thread.  What is done with the agency matters as much as who has it.  We like to use ours to include times for group intuitive continuity/story-after once every two or three scenes.\n<blockquote><p>Obviously.

Probably because the appealing concept rarely goes away.  Watchdogs for the King of Life enacting their take on His will at gun point.  Ohh!  You just inspired a branch of thinking about morality in Right to Dream play.  Basically looking at my DitV play as Right to Dream play focused on the points of contention between Kierkegaard's position and that of most other existentialists.  I think it may be more appropriate to the Forge's Actual Play forum than this thread though.  Either way, thanks!<br/><br/>In the OP of this thread, Zac in Davis said that *the* thing the Forge produced was an emphasis on player agency.  If I were to pick the main thing that I see the result of the Forge being, I would pick the idea that it's about real people participating in actual play.  The heart of "indie" game design (as characterized by the forge) is paying attention to the social elements.<br/><br/>Also, since what you do with the player agency and why is as important as who has it, I'm going to disagree with the idea that if you're dissatisfied with traditional play then you should try games with more player agency.  I think instead the thing to focus on is what the actual participants want out of the game and whether or not they are compatible as a group and if the game being played supports those desires.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214104/#Comment_214104" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-23T16:24:45+00:00" title="June 23, 2009  4:24PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: nathanh</cite><br/>In the OP of this thread, Zac in Davis said that *the* thing the Forge produced was an emphasis on player agency.

He goes on to call it a new way of playing (I'm assuming compared to traditional modes of high GM authority).  And then advocates as a way of solving dissatisfaction with play.  Zac, let me know if I don't have your point right here.<br/><br/>The idea that *the* thing that the Forge contributed is to pay attention to the actual participants, their desires, the social situation and actual play (which is to say, the social elements of it all) isn't the same as that.  In the paragraph after the one you quoted, I go on to say that if there is dissatisfaction with play, then what needs to be examined are the actual desires of the real people involved.  Not just prescribing player agency as a remedy.<br/><br/>I found someone who says it better than I can:<br/><a href="http://swingpad.com/dustyboots/wordpress/?p=93" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://swingpad.com/dustyboots/wordpress/?p=93</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214140">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214140/#Comment_214140" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-23T23:51:48+00:00" title="June 23, 2009 11:51PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nathan, you're spot-on about what I was saying.

It's likely that the Forge designs emphasize player agency because they are an attempt to provide an alternative for those people for whom that is the proper solution to <b>their</b> dissatisfaction with actual play.  That many of those who were formative for the Forge and for whom the Forge was formative were those who were dissatisfied with things that an increase in player agency would fix.  My best guess is that Story Now! games that concentrate on player agency making up the majority of indie game designs is a result of the common interests of the participants of the Forge as a social phenomenon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
