                    You're likely to be familiar with "Wushu":http://wiki.saberpunk.net/pm2/pmwiki.php?n=Wushu.HomePage. If not, check it out! The system is all about abstracted conflict resolution, powered by incentivizing narration - players get +1 die for each embellishment they add. I love the effect on people who play Wushu for the first time. Within a few rounds, they're spinning out awesome narration like CRAZY.<br/>
<br/>
However, from the times I've played it, there have been some shortcomings. Within a few rounds, my friends were all narrating enough details to be well past their die limit (this is called a fillibuster) and they were regularly doing this every round; it made the counting of details/dice hardly worth it! And yet, there was a major incentive to maximize your die pool whenever possible, since each extra die not only increased your general odds, but increased the range of possible possibilities, a big enough boost that an extra die is always worth reaching for. A downside in practice is that players' narrations get unwieldy, and the +1 die/embellishment is not longer really helping us get *good* narration.<br/>
<br/>
So, some changes that come to mind:<br/>
<br/>
*Roll and keep.* So rather than getting a number of successes from your die pool, instead just take the highest die rolled, and compare it to your opponents best roll to see who won. The idea is that, if you don't want to narrate something lengthy, you can still roll the default die for your action and have the same range of possible results (between 1 and 6). There's an incentive for you to keep adding dice to your pool if possible, but there's also a point of diminishing returns on bonus dice, so you'll be less inlcined to overstretch yourself for the sake of dice.<br/>
<br/>
*Style/theme bonuses, rather than details.* You get +1 die for each different kind of style you work into your narration, rather than for each discrete detail you work in there; what I'm rewarding here is integrating multiple good themes into whatever your narration happens to be. So these kind of things would be your own personal traits ("expert swordsman"), the flaws of others ("fights a little slow"), and elements of the scenery ("a balcony").<br/>
<br/>
*Collaboration.* I'm working out the details, but there should be a way for the GM or players - including those not in this scene - to add new stylistic "scenery" on the fly that others can use to earn bonus dice. This might be new details, or it might be just highlighting a single element in the scene ("the barrel filled with kerosene") to encourage its use by others.<br/>
<br/>
Am I getting somewhere?                </div>

<p>I've given him money before, no doubt, though I didn't pick up Wire-Fu. I didn't think it substantially changed the Wushu rules though to such an extent. Am I wrong?</p>

                            Roll and keep sounds a bit like sorcerer, where you can get a lot of bonus dice for descriptions, circumstances, and previous successes, but you only count the highest ones (the ones highest then the opposing rolls highest die).
<p><br/>The Wire-Fu supplement has a rule called <i>Held Dice</i>, mentioned in this <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=262788" rel="nofollow">RPG.net thread</a> about revising the Wushu open (CC-licensed) rules. Specifically, Dan Bayn gave permission to include this bit:<br/></p><p><br/></p><blockquote><br/><b>Optional Extras: Held Dice (originally published in Wire-Fu)</b><br/><br/>Normally you can only earn dice during a conflict, to be used in that conflict. However, you can also earn dice which are held over - Held Dice - to be used for a specific task later on. It is in this way Wushu can reward preparation. Each Detail describing a preparation activity adds to either an individual or communal pool of Held Dice to be used later on. A scene with a round of planning or foreshadowing are just two means of earning Held Dice.<br/><br/>For more on Held Dice you'll have to get <i>Wire-Fu</i> for yourselves.<br/></blockquote>
I like the idea of focusing the players on details that either enrich the scene (scenery, NPCs) or emphesize the core traits of their PCs or their opponents. I think it's good player advice, but might be tricky to implement in play.
<p><br/>Another way to solve the over-descriptiveness problem might be to just set lower dice caps, and adjust the threat level.<br/></p><p><br/>Finally, I suspect that rpg.net is really the place to talk about Wushu, because that's where it's clever fans (and its author) hang out.</p> </div>
