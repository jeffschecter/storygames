<a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=21902.0" rel="nofollow">Cross-Posted</a> in part at The Forge.<br/><br/>Thought I'd share some ideas I've had about breakdowns in Hero's Banner. I know the Durham 3 had some issues. Evidently, so did I. Hence, the following. Let me know what you think if you're willing.<br/><br/> - - - - - - - - - -<br/><br/>These rules are meant to both add more detail to your breakdowns, but also to tone down the severity of a breakdown earlier in an episode.<br/><br/>If you roll doubles on a passion check and your character's total passion is less than or equal to 25, then your character has no breakdown. You are limited by the success or failure rolled during the underlying conflict check, and you continue to roll any remaining passion checks. Instead of a breakdown, you simply add one of the numbers rolled to your passion and continue as normal. So if you rolled double 4s on the second of three passion checks, you'd add 4 to your passion score and then roll the remaining passion check in the series.<br/><br/>If you roll doubles on a passion check and your character's total passion is greater than 25 but less than or equal to 50, then your character has a minor breakdown. A minor breakdown means that your character breaks some social norm in a small way that hints at the discontent within. Mechanically, a minor breakdown is handled just as if you hadn't rolled a breakdown at all. You roll your complete set of passion checks (although you can only suffer one breakdown per conflict check). You are limited by the success or failure determined in the underlying conflict check.<br/><br/>As part of a minor breakdown, the GM must also interject a single complication into your narration. With this complication, the GM may dictate a single action taken by your character, another PC, or important NPC. Or he may decide to narrate a detail concerning the setting, or a group of less important NPCs. Whatever the complication, it should be a detail that helps to establish the fact that your character doesn't have control over the world around him.<br/><br/>If you roll doubles on a passion check and your character's total passion is greater than 50 but less than or equal to 75, then your character has a serious breakdown. A serious breakdown means that your character has temporarily lost control. He has stepped over the line of normal behavior without regard for who he hurts or what people think of him. At this point, a breakdown becomes a release-valve for passion. When you roll a serious breakdown, you do not roll any remaining passion checks in your series. Moreover, you are no longer limited by the success or failure that you rolled during the conflict check. You can turn a success into a failure, or a failure into a success. As part of a serious breakdown, the GM also has the option, but isn't required to, insert a complication into your narration.<br/><br/>Finally, if you roll doubles on a passion check and your character's total passion is greater than 75 but less than 100, your character has a complete breakdown. Now, the rules for breakdowns are as detailed in the book. Your character has a total meltdown. He loses control as his passion completely consumes him. He allows all of the pressures he is facing to overtake him. Hysteria, depression, violence, and similar words all describe what could happen during a complete breakdown. You, and you alone, narrate what happens during a complete breakdown. Passion is cutoff the moment you roll doubles. And of course you get to determine the success or failure suffered by your character.                </div>

                            Huh.<br/><br/>I've played two sessions and we've only had one breakdown, ever.  I'd hesitate to use these rules, simply because it would lessen the impact of a relatively rare event.<br/><br/>On average, a HB character will have one breakdown in the duration of their story.  It seems like reducing the impact of it is more than a little sad.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>

                            Ben,<br/><br/>Math-wise under the normal rules, it actually works out so that breakdowns happen quite a bit (Remember you have a breakdown anytime doubles come up on a passion check. With three passion checks per conflict per character, that's pretty good odds.) Now, in actual play the number of breakdowns may be quite a bit less, but that's really just probability at work. Some sessions I've had each character have multiple breakdowns. Others, I've had exactly one breakdown all night. I actually like lots of breakdowns, but sometimes I've felt like it was too much too soon.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, your concern is well-taken, which is why this isn't any sort of official suggestion as of yet. The real idea is to provide a bit more crunchiness as characters accumulate more passion. If you're happy with the way things are, then by all means follow the book rules as is.                        </div>

                            Yeah Ben, that in no way echoes our experience, where we were breaking down with comic regularity.  To be fair, in our final session it was much less common, so probability was at work.<br/><br/>Tim, I'm not sold on adding extra rules to breakdowns, particularly rules that force you to attenuate them regardless of your situation or intent.  They are cool when they happen at the right time at the right frequency.  If there's a problem with them, I'd say it is that their appearance is uncontrolled and highly variable.  They happen when it doesn't matter, and they don't happen when it would be amazing.                        </div>

                            Hey, Tim --<br/><br/>You'll get a breakdown one out of every ten times you roll a passion check.<br/><br/>On average, a passion check generates 11 passion.<br/><br/>So, for the "ultimate average" character, you'd roll 10 passion checks, one of which would be a breakdown.<br/><br/>Now, of course, there's considerable deviance from this mean.  Over the course of four characters (two players for two generations), my group has generated one breakdown.  Jason had a swing in the opposite direction.<br/><br/>If you're worried about the "comic frequency" think, maybe you could do something like "if you roll a breakdown, you cannot roll a breakdown on your next set of passion checks."  Dampening the effect of it seems sad to me.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>

                            Hey Ben,<br/><br/>I appreciate your number-crunching, but I think your math's a bit off. Not too far off mind you; so I think your point is still valid.<br/><br/>Yes, it's true, you'll average a roll of doubles every 1 in 10 passion checks (10 possible doubles out of a possible 100 different outcomes). However, the average passion check will really only be something like 6, not 11. Remember that when rolling a passion check you take only the higher of the two dice -- you don't add them together, which is how I think you came up with 11. But you roll an average of three passion checks per conflict when called for; so that's an average increase in passion of 18 per conflict.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, that's still only about 17 passion checks (not series of passion checks) on average to get to 100 total passion during the course of an episode. That puts the average number of breakdowns at about 1.7 per character per episode. Of course there is room for a decent amount of deviance if only because there are a lot of factors that have to average out in order to arrive at an overall average of 1.7.<br/><br/>So perhaps I am being a bit heavy-handed with my suggested variation. I think my major concern is with a full-on breakdown too early in an episode. Then again, I've seen some rocking breakdowns happen on the very first conflict-check -- what a way to start out a story!<br/><br/>I still think that delineating breakdowns isn't a bad idea. I might change it so that the level of breakdown becomes a minimum rather than a requirement. Ignoring all of the other rules I suggested in my original post, change things to the following. From 0-25 total passion, you can choose to have no breakdown. From 26-50, you must have at minimum a minor breakdown. From 51-75, a minimum of a serious breakdown. And from 76-99, a minimum of a complete breakdown. That way you can always upgrade your narration if you want to, but the rules are providing some guidance to tone things down earlier in the game.<br/><br/>I also like your suggestion about preventing two breakdowns from happening right in a row on consecutive conflict checks. But I think I'll address that as I respond to Jason's comments.                        </div>

Jason,<br/><br/>Thanks for responding. I was hoping you would chime in. I think I understand where you're coming from. However, I also think we're coming at this from two different directions stylistically. Bear with me, as I don't want to put words in your mouth.<br/><br/>To begin, I can totally sympathize with you when you say that as a player you do or don't want a breakdown at a particular moment and the dice don't cooperate with you. On the other had, I designed the rules to do just that: sometimes frustrate the player with breakdowns as much as his character must be frustrated with actually breaking down. I wanted breakdowns to be about losing control. And as we all know, sometimes people lose control at all the wrong moments.<br/><br/>As I see it there's two schools of thought here. First, I could design the game the way I did, so that the player is beholden to the dice and simply must work with the results as they come up (just like standard dice-driven task or conflict resolution in most games). Second, in the alternative, I could give the player complete authorial control in deciding when his character has a breakdown. This way the player would always remain in control even though his character does not (this is closer to something like drama points in a traditional game: you use them only when you want and save them for times that you believe to be most dramatic or else most strategic). I suppose I chose the former because as a player I like the surprise. Does that make sense? I'm not saying there's anything wrong with the latter method. It's just not the feel I was after.<br/><br/>What I am concerned with now, though, is doing away with that "comical regularity" you were talking about. Having one breakdown after another certainly saps the mechanic of its intended purpose. I also tend to think that forcing the player to narrate a catastrophic breakdown super early in the episode can lead to unintended consequences, namely awkward scenes. I'm wondering if that balance already exists or if a few variations to the rules would help.<br/><br/>As I said, I like Ben's suggestion about preventing two breakdowns in a row. Setting up some guidelines as to the severity of a breakdown is also appealing to me, even if those guidelines are essentially optional. Finally, I've been toying with the idea of giving the players a veto. If a player doesn't want a breakdown "now", he can veto his current breakdown, knowing that he has increased his chances of breaking down later. I'm not sure how that would work, but assuming I hammered out some details would that help give you at least some of what you're after, Jason?<br/><br/>And again, for anyone else reading this, these would all simply be optional rules at this point.                        </div>

<p>Here's a super-clumsy implementation:</p>
<p>When you roll passion checks, roll one extra die. Breakdowns still happen on pairs, and you still take the highest die for your passion increase. You can keep vetoing, but it keeps adding passion dice. They reset to two when you accept a breakdown.</p>

                            Hi Tim, <br/><br/>As a player I already adjust my breakdown appropriately.  If it is a ridiculous time for one, it will be a pretty minor event in my narration.  If it's the perfect time, it'll be a barn-burner.  I actually never got a breakdown during a passion check where I thought it'd be fun and appropriate, even in the sessions where I got four or five of them.  Remi did a few times.  You're right about diffrent play styles - I'd rather be trusted to pull the trigger at the right time than be surprised, but that's not a better solution, just a different one.                        </div>

That's not bad actually. I'd tweak it further so that the player could only keep so many dice as a maximum. Afterwards, if he rolled a breakdown, he'd have to take it regardless. My only concern would that with more passion dice, it might screw with the pacing of the episode; so that the player with the extra dice would advance towards the endgame much faster than the rest of the group. He might even advance too fast for his own taste, especially because at something like three dice his chances of rolling doubles is increased for sure, but not by that much. In all, though, that's definitely along the lines of what I was thinking.                        </div>

                            Hey Tim,<br/><br/>I'm getting ready to run Hero's Banner for Danielle, Tim Kleinert, Tim's brother Gabe, and maybe one of Gabe's friends, and so I thought I'd crunch the numbers on Shreyas' suggested alternative breakdown rules to see if we should maybe give them a try. I used the Mike Holmes brute force method, because I can't do the raw math. So these percentages are based on 9350 passion checks in an Excel spreadsheet. I think they give a good rough idea of the progression:<br/><br/>Chance of a breakdown on 2 dice: 10.0%<br/>Chance of a breakdown on 3 dice: 27.8%<br/>Chance of a breakdown on 4 dice: 49.5%<br/>Chance of a breakdown on 5 dice: 69.9%<br/>Chance of a breakdown on 6 dice: 84.2%<br/>Chance of a breakdown on 7 dice: 93.8%<br/>Chance of a breakdown on 8 dice: 98.2%<br/><br/>Average high die rolling 2 dice: 7.1<br/>Average high die rolling 3 dice: 8.0<br/>Average high die rolling 4 dice: 8.4<br/>Average high die rolling 5 dice: 8.8<br/>Average high die rolling 6 dice: 9.0<br/>Average high die rolling 7 dice: 9.2<br/>Average high die rolling 8 dice: 9.3<br/><br/>When I re-roll the 9350 passion checks, which I can do again and again by just refreshing the spreadsheet, the breakdown percentages shift a bit, up or down a few tenths of a point, so the chance of a breakdown on two dice, which we know mathmatically is exactly 10%, actually slops around generally somewhere between 9.4% and 10.4%. (I know I could minimize the shifting by calculating the percentage against more than 9350 passion checks, but Excel is choking on me when I put more rows of passion checks into the spreadsheet. I'm guessing I don't have enough RAM.) The average high die calculations are solid though. Mostly they don't shift at all. If one of them does, it's only by a tenth of a point. And so I'm thinking your estimate that passion currently increases by an average of 18 per conflict is off. I think the truer average is 21. And so with Shreyas' suggested variant mechanic a player with an average character who vetoes even a single breakdown will go into endgame after four passion series, rather than five.<br/><br/>I dunno, I don't think it's getting you what you want. It practically ensures a player who vetoes a breakdown will roll one on his next passion series (~84% chance). Does that encourage taking a failure when the player might otherwise choose to re-roll? Or does it encourage vetoing the second breakdown at the cost of burning through the character even more quickly? I'd be cool with the former, but I think it more encourages the latter.<br/><br/>I think vetoes are a really good idea, but rather than a mechanical deterrent I think you want something thematic as an effect. So thematically what's the effect of repressing your passion gone amok? You're controlling yourself. You're being untrue to yourself. And so...you're more likely to regret how things turn out. So perhaps...you can veto a breakdown by crossing out an unfilled Connection slot for the influence in question. If you don't have an unfilled slot, you can't veto. If this ends up not your winning influence, then it makes sense in retrospect that you were able to control yourself. And if it does, then it makes sense that your endgame is filled with regret, or loneliness.<br/><br/>Whaddya think?<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>

                            Paul,<br/>
<br/>
Very interesting. I think your numbers look correct, including an average passion increase of 21 instead of my original estimation of 18. This would put the average number of passion checks to reach 100 at 14.3, or 15 in practical terms (versus my original calculation of 17). This also means that the average player will suffer about 1.5 breakdowns per character.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of numbers. The short end of all this is, however, that on average a player is going to have about one, maybe two, breakdowns per character. Some will have none; others will have a bunch. Sometimes it's going to seem as if your group is having a whole bunch of breakdowns simply because everyone is rolling their average number of breakdowns and it looks like a lot when taken collectively.<br/>
<br/>
But really, the more I think about the breakdown issues some people have been having, the more I see things in three different ways.<br/>
<br/>
First, there's me. I like the breakdown rules, and unless I'm either teaching the game to new players or purposefully wanting to change the feel of the game to suit my needs (no breakdowns in the early part of the game for example), then I'm going to roll the dice and let them fall where they may. If I or the other people I'm playing with roll lots or no breakdowns, oh well.<br/>
<br/>
Second, there's the people who want to delay, save, or otherwise decide exactly when their characters have a breakdown. These people are interested in the timing of a breakdown and whether or not they have control over when it happens.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, you have the people who are most concerned with the relative severity of breakdowns, either because they feel the breakdown is ill-timed or else because they simply want a more somber character. I feel I've already addressed this group's concerns both with some of my suggestions above, and more importantly, by stating that breakdowns do not always have to be the "rage against the dying of the light" type of scenes that I favor (perhaps too much) in the book text. You always have control over the degree of breakdown your character has. The only requirement in the base rules is that your character has *some* sort of a breakdown.<br/>
<br/>
As to the second group, I think both you, Paul, and Shreyas are onto something. I especially like your suggestion regarding the use of a connection to delay a breakdown: thematic is definitely a strong way to go. I might even make it more severe by requiring the player to first lose an *actual* connection and then only as a back-up lose a *potential* connection. Obviously then, if you've used all three of your character's slots, then you are forced to have a breakdown. I have to say, I like the idea of a brooding character attempting to bottle everything up -- and taking with him everything around.<br/>
<br/>
As you say -- and no matter if you're losing a connection or only a connection slot -- the delayed effect would be to create a more lonely/regretful character come endgame (assuming your character ends with the relevant influence). The immediate effects, though, would not only be the lost connection, but also the subtle desire to change your character's focus from one influence to another.<br/>
<br/>
So, yeah, I'd give it a try.<br/>
<br/>
Of course the other option would be to simply do away with breakdowns and integrate their effect via normal narration rights... But what fun would that be? Freeform? Bah!<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>
- Tim<br/>
<br/>
P.S. As an aside, where did you get the 84% from in your third to last paragraph? Perhaps I misunderstand you, but wouldn't the chance of another breakdown only be 27.8% (3 dice versus 2 on your chart?). Either way, I think your comments still hold. And that's another reason I'm starting to warm up to a "thematic effect" veto.                        </div>

                            Hey Tim,<br/><br/>What I label "chance of a breakdown" is actually the chance of rolling doubles on the specified number of dice. So, if I'm rolling a series of three passion checks with three dice rather than two, each check has a 27.8% chance of rolling doubles, and the whole series of three checks has a total chance of ~84% (27.8%  + 27.8%  + 27.8% ), right?<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>

                            Hey, Paul --<br/><br/>You've got your probability wrong, there.  Probabilities don't add.  Rather, you need to invert the probabilities (to get the probability that it won't happen) and multiply them.<br/><br/>Doing this myself: if you have a %27.8 chance of rolling doubles, your chance of rolling doubles at least once is %62.4<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>
