I confess I'm a little intimidated by it in terms of actually using it in play. So, Malcolm or anyone else who's used it, any recommendations?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97608">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick" title="Andrew Kenrick"><img alt="Andrew Kenrick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/145/415482171_321214bd7c.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick">Andrew Kenrick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97608/#Comment_97608" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-19T14:44:33+00:00" title="September 19, 2007  2:44PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 19, 2007 2:49PM by Andrew Kenrick.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't try to use it all at once! Pick out a couple of the handouts that really grab you, hunt through them for interesting elements and try to incorporate those into your scenario. Then find a way to use the handout in the scenario!<br/><br/>I went through each of the handouts and jotted down what it concerned and which names and elements it referenced, then stuck a post it note to the back. That way I can flick through them and see which ones make sense together, and make sure the scenario incorporates the names and elements it mentions.<br/><br/>I've used it for a one-off game where some of the Nazi scientists mentioned in the dossier were trying to recreate one of their experiments with harnessing time (the one talked about in the little nazi pamphlet), and used several of the handouts as exposition and foreshadowing for this. I think I used a couple as briefing documents for the PCs too, as they alude to the experiment.<br/><br/>There's quite a high impact value, midway through the scenario as they're piecing things together, to pulling out one of the handouts and dropping it in front of them, saying "you find this tucked behind the desk." They really, really dug that.<br/><br/>Sorry if it's a little vague - my notes for the scenario (and the dossier) aren't to hand at the moment!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_97706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig" title="Malcolm Craig"><img alt="Malcolm Craig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/contestedground/UntitledAlbum/photo?authkey=UQZ1oivg8Lc#5239981636020065186"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig">Malcolm Craig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97706/#Comment_97706" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-20T01:32:31+00:00" title="September 20, 2007  1:32AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 20, 2007 1:32AM by Malcolm Craig.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andy is qite right. One or two items used during the course of a game is good, dropping the whole load on everyone is not so grand. There are threads which run through the Dossier, so one piece here, followed by another piece there really would allow people to make up their own stories based upon the vague evidence given in the handouts. In fact, that's one thing I am very keen to hear about: how the Dossier was actually used, what people made of it, what kinds of story came out of it. <br/><br/>You could always pick the item that excites or inspires you the most, fire that in at the very start of the game and see where it takes you. A good one for this is always the Kammler Report, which can send people off in spirals of conspiracy. And the After Action Report from the RPA could easily be used to kick off a follow up to what is talked about in the report. Perhaps the group will find out all the stuff that wasn't talked about? Who knows?<br/><br/>Suffice to say I'd be delighted to hear how you do end up using the Dossier.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malcolm                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97750">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

One of the things I like about it is that there is a lot of stuff that is open to interpretation by the individual, depending on what interests them in the documents. A 'map' is not something I had actually ever thought of, for pretty much this reason. However, if someone were to contact me with questions about it, I'd always be more than happy to point out little bits and pieces here and there. For example, if someone wanted to know who was an actual historical figure and who was made up and wanted to find out more about them, I'd be delighted to point people in the right direction.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm pretty pleased with the way the Dossier turned out and I'm really keen to find out more about how people are actually using it.<br/><br/>And, if you have any questions about CC I would be delighted to answer them.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malcolm                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98359">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Shevaun" title="Shevaun"><img alt="Shevaun" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Shevaun">Shevaun</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98359/#Comment_98359" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-22T19:27:52+00:00" title="September 22, 2007  7:27PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Use the dossier?

But one tip might be to encourage them to all read the handout as players to see what info is either being shared with or held back from their character.
