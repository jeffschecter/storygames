One thing that came up repeatedly in one conversation was status, specifically how status preference affects gaming. The following came out of conversation with a gaming friend, Asahira, and he's said my takes make sense to him. <br/><br/>A little background: Asahira, the friend I was talking to, much prefers playing to gamemastering. He also loves playing cool, badass guys and likes to figure out effective character builds and combat strategies in crunchy games like GURPS or (A)D&amp;D. He tried gamemastering once and didn't like it very much--functional gamemastering isn't about winning, after all, and while it was okay overall, he did fall into the trap of the uber-NPC. <br/><br/>He's also a good sport who comes along for the ride on the dirty hippie games I run, from My Life with Master to FATE and Dogs in the Vineyard, and recently Primetime Adventures. He thinks story games have a lot of merit, though not the in the things he prefers. After trying a wide range of available games and styles he still likes crunchiness and badassery best, which I think is cool. He was and is willing to try new things, and knows exactly what he likes out of lots of options, not because it's the only thing he ever tried. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, I was curious why he and many others liked crunchy adventures in badassery (that sounds like it should be a game) to the point of exclusivity. And after talking to him about this I think the answer lies in status preference. In short, he and others with like taste like to win by figuring out strategic elements in a complex game, and they like to have in-game status by playing tough, no-nonsense, invulnerable characters. <br/><br/>Status preference explains a lot about gamemastering preference or style. For instance, I love playing both high-status and low-status characters as GM. The sidebar on reasons to play high- and low-status had a lot of  "That's me!" moments (like much of Play Unsafe, really). Asahira, on the other hand, hates playing low status characters. Even as GM, as mentioned above, he irritated his players with an NPC who did everything better than the PCs and didn't ever have vulnerabilities and flaws--other than, evidently, being a cocky know-it-all. <br/><br/>Further, status--in the sense of winning--may also explain rules preference. While Asahira has tried and freely admits the good points of story games, he still likes crunchy, strategic rules best. While story games do have success and failure, winning and losing, they're often more about facilitating drama. These stories also tend to involve fluctuating status, more than in the sense where you can get back by the end of the session at the jerk who disarmed you and locked you up, but serious, profound, long-term changes in character and status. Good story also requires some character vulnerability, something that isn't very agreeable for gamers with a strong preference for high status. <br/><br/>Overall, there seems to be a lot of predictive power in status preference that I think could be a useful tool to gauge gaming expectations and compatibilities. Thinking about our differences in terms of status preference explains quite a few of the styles clashes we'd been having when we game together. (I had a hard time getting a handle on his characters, for instance, because they didn't seem to have personal vulnerabilities and never seemed to be in the wrong.) This isn't to say I won't ever gamie with Asahira again, of course. In fact, I feel like we'll both enjoy gaming together a lot more now that we understand a little more about what makes the other tick.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_115351">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/schlafmanko" title="schlafmanko"><img alt="schlafmanko" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/schlafmanko">schlafmanko</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115351/#Comment_115351" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-19T11:08:34+00:00" title="December 19, 2007 11:08AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 19, 2007 11:52AM by schlafmanko.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm so with you on this line of thinking.  Take a look at <a href="http://www.i-would-knife-fight-a-man.com/forum/comments.php?DiscussionID=2849" rel="nofollow">this thread</a> on Knife Fight, particularly the second entry, which is about what I would've said here if I hadn't just said it there.  (unlike a lot of stuff on Knife Fight, you don't need to be registered to view the thread. you don't need to have posted anything else to participate in it, either, but the discussion's drifted from what you're interested in here.  Brand also had an interesting <a href="http://www.i-would-knife-fight-a-man.com/forum/comments.php?DiscussionID=2890" rel="nofollow">thread</a>  last week on status and winning, but you'd need to register to see it.)<br/><br/>So at least in my experience, the concept of status "preference" is complicated.  There's a lot of reflex that goes into status positioning within a group, as well as habits that come from other games and gaming groups.  Plus there's some interaction back and forth between status behavior in a friend group that also games together, status behavior as a gamer playing with those other people in a gaming group, and status behavior as a character.  Changing any one of those can sometimes affect the other spheres  -- e.g. the example at the very end of the thread about how changes in other players' status behavior can affect your sense of character skill / status.  Historically, I've preferred stories where my character gets screwed over stories where I have a clearcut happy ending, partly because I find getting screwed more immersive, but I suspect that's related to my relative comfort with being a low status player back in my college group. (which was in turn because I wasn't on board with the group's creative agenda and it limited the ways I could contribute to the game)<br/><br/>But status behavior in those three spheres can also be disjoint, sometimes really disjoint.  As a minor example, one of the players in our group who historically likes his characters to "win" recently decided to shift toward playing a more vulnerable character -- someone who had something to lose -- because after watching one of my character arcs, he decided that it might be more interesting and that he might have a larger share of the story if he played someone who had a lot at stake. <br/><br/>I don't suppose any of this is directly useful to your situation, since it sounds like Asahira does have a clearcut status preference.  But if it's not too awkward to talk about, I'm curious how Asahira positions himself status-wise in your gaming group when you aren't actively in the process of playing a game. [ed. also, is this the same player you were talking about in that thread re immersion?]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_115370">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115370/#Comment_115370" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-19T11:37:47+00:00" title="December 19, 2007 11:37AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a whole untapped field, and it's hugely important to everything that happens at the gaming table. Many times, as schlaf mentions in her question, it ends up tied up in out-of-game status and social arrangements because virtually all games put their fingers in their ears and yell "LA LA LA" about it.  That can be okay or it can be problematic.<br/><br/>I have mentioned a player in my group before. Her preferences for what to do on a Saturday afternoon go, in order:<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> best thing to do: game, and her character doesn't suffer any real setbacks or difficulties<br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> best thing to do: watch TV<br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> best thing to do: game, and her character suffers real setbacks and difficulties<br/><br/>It took me forever to figure this out, and once I figured it out I moped around until I remembered that nobody else at the table really gave a crap whether her character suffered real setbacks and difficulties or succeeded at everything easily, so I started having her character succeed at everything easily and continued to give other characters real setbacks and difficulties according to their players' preferences, and everything started running a lot more smoothly and everyone was a lot more happy with her play and their own. <br/><br/>Interestingly, she has a bit of an outsider status with respect to the rest of the group - doesn't always attend, came to the group later than everyone else...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_115406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115406/#Comment_115406" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-19T13:49:39+00:00" title="December 19, 2007  1:49PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hm. See, I've always been curious about the player who claims to be all into the strategy and winning and stuff like that, but then chafes at having their character's status temporarily reduced, and not seeing it as the opportunity that it actually is. <br/><br/>In-game challenges have to come from somewhere, and status reduction is pretty much the only tool you have if the campaign goes long enough - if you're the biggest badass in the land, there *has* to be a bigger badass for you to prove yourself against at some point. If you're in a position of power, that power *has* to get threatened at some point. Maybe not in a big way that changes up the whole character, but in some way that provides the basic impetus to compete.<br/><br/>So it strikes me as kind of a contradictory position, and perhaps more seriously, potentially suggests the player's use of gaming as some kind of... I don't know, weird coping tool. Setbacks and failures are a large part of what we deal with in life, after all - so someone who has issues dealing with them in real life, via self-esteem issues or whatever else, probably isn't going to want to bring them into the game. To be absolutely clear, I'm not saying that to make a judgment call on any of the examples given above; I'm actually reflecting on people I know and have gamed with.<br/><br/>Like, I came in as a newcomer to a friend of mine's group, who wanted to run a hacked Fate game. And there was this guy there, clearly the oldest gent in the group, who seemed to occupy this strange position as a mentor figure - he pretty much responded to everything anyone talked about like he had a deep understanding, would relate stories about his multifaceted life without prompting, effortlessly received the doe-eyed, "please teach us" look from most of the group whenever he talked, etc. <br/><br/>He even went so far as to tell me casually, "Yeah, I don't really advertise myself as a guru, but you know, if you're looking for one, I'm usually around." I'm serious. No lie. In retrospect, I should have walked out the door right there.<br/><br/>So we did character creation, and we ended up playing the chief members of this cult in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, charlatans who were trying to rule the land by using lost technology we'd found to convince people we had power and answers. This dude naturally moves to create the cult's leader, and I don't think there was any avoiding it, and certainly this sat very well with the members of the group. I ended up making this sociopathic tech genius, kidnapped by the other cult members very young and taught the secrets of this lost technology by an AI, barely seeing any other people for all his formative years. <br/><br/>So we meet a second time and play, and pretty much, shit goes wrong right from the get-go. Because this dude was the cult leader, it wasn't enough for him to defend his status at all costs - he required every other player to take the same approach, to follow him in a creepily real sense, and bickered at people to change their actions and stuff if he perceived a threat to his plans. Like, not in a cool, "let's make conflict between the characters" way, but clearly as a player demanding obedience from another player. I couldn't really do anything to make the proceedings of the first session interesting, and no one could really take advantage of any compels.<br/><br/>It really creeped me out. I'm certain it'd have been a very volatile personal argument if I'd actually tried to push for any status transitions during play. I didn't return, and the game fell apart after a third session.<br/><br/>I was at a bar with my friend (who, by the way, was the only one who didn't really respond to this guy in the ways I described above) some months later, and the conversation drifted back to this game, and he explained to me that Creepy Guy had been a divorce lawyer in life, but had stopped practicing and pretty much was living off of relative's/spouse's/government's money or something like that, and basically was content to bum out, leech cash, and not really do anything else with his life.<br/><br/>It made me understand his actions during the game, and why he'd expend so much energy to develop that particular social position in that group, in a much clearer context.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_115423">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115423/#Comment_115423" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-19T15:26:08+00:00" title="December 19, 2007  3:26PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 19, 2007 3:29PM by Graham.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's all fascinating stuff.

The interaction between character status, gamer status, and social status is particularly interesting, as seen in Landon's creepy dude example. \n<blockquote>But status behavior in those three spheres can also be disjoint, sometimes really disjoint.</blockquote>\nYeah, I'm one example. I tend to be pretty high status in any group, but I love playing low-status characters, and when I play high-status NPCs I mostly look forward to their downfall at the hands of the PCs. \n<blockquote>As a minor example, one of the players in our group who historically likes his characters to "win" recently decided to shift toward playing a more vulnerable character -- someone who had something to lose -- because after watching one of my character arcs, he decided that it might be more interesting and that he might have a larger share of the story if he played someone who had a lot at stake.</blockquote>\nThat's something of my experience with Asahira, too. He's picked up a bit on character vulnerabilities and character issues by playing with me, though he still does have a clear status preference.\n<blockquote>I don't suppose any of this is directly useful to your situation, since it sounds like Asahira does have a clearcut status preference.

(He's willing to give it a try after I said I couldn't continue running his character's story without a more distributed authority structure, but that's another thread.) I wonder if there's a correlation between status and immersion preference, but that seems a bit speculative. <br/><br/>Asahira's in-group status is interesting because from what he says and what I know of him, I think he's always the player to work the most closely with the GM. I don't think he seeks favoritism per se, rather he really gets into any character he's playing and tends to talk to his GMs a lot about that character, how to power him (it's always a guy) up, where to go with his story, etc. <br/><br/>I know he's had some special arrangements for a lot of characters, for instance making two concurrent PCs in one campaign, being the only one to roll 4d6 - 1d6 for stats in an AD&amp;D game, and he takes great pride in the kickass items he's granted. In another AD&amp;D game he and his GM overhauled the Paladin class into a Chaotic Good protector of freedom because Asahira doesn't like characters who are obedient to authority. <br/><br/>I'm not disparaging this at all. I think it's terrific that he finds arrangements to suit himself and the group, and lots of people should and do make these kinds of arrangements. I just write to point out that Asahira definitely likes to have some kind of unique or special status within the group, both in and out of game. <br/><br/>(Whew! I totally get that part about status being emotional; even discussing behavior in terms of status sounds judgmental.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_115429">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eldir" title="Eldir"><img alt="Eldir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i182.photobucket.com/albums/x208/loki_laufeysson/goplay_dotted_32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eldir">Eldir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115429/#Comment_115429" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-19T15:49:09+00:00" title="December 19, 2007  3:49PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 19, 2007 3:49PM by Eldir.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>This is a whole untapped field, and it's hugely important to everything that happens at the gaming table.

For instance, I get a real kick out of playing this low-status NPC whose abilities are a running joke and who has serious emotional and social issues. The vulnerability in that fictional position doesn't bother me at all, probably for two main reasons. First, as a GM, I have plenty of other character positions (NPCs). Second, as a well-liked and integral member of the group (man, I sound cocky), the character's position doesn't take anything away from my own status. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Landon Darkwood</cite>Hm.

As schlaf said, real-life status and character status interact in very complex ways, though in this case the connection seems more straightforward. <br/><br/>That said, Asahira does enjoy temporary setbacks, such as being disarmed and tossed into a cell, especiallly if he can make a glorious comeback from it. I guess he's a true Gamist in that sense. I doubt he'd enjoy long-term or permanent drops in status as much, though. \n<blockquote>[T]here was this guy there, clearly the oldest gent in the group, who seemed to occupy this strange position as a mentor figure - he pretty much responded to everything anyone talked about like he had a deep understanding, would relate stories about his multifaceted life without prompting, effortlessly received the doe-eyed, "please teach us" look from most of the group whenever he talked, etc.</blockquote>\nNightmares... returning... <br/><br/>I knew a player like that, too, in probably my worst long-term gaming experience ever. He was the GM's middle-aged uncle, and his psychological sway over the GM was so absolute it was creepy. The GM showed his uncle the most blatant favoritism ever. Did you ever see a campaign where one PC started at a much higher power level than the other PCs, without the other players' consent and without any corresponding advantage to the other PCs? How about a campaign where the NPCs pretty much only talked to one PC, so that everyone else's ability to influence events was severely limited? I can't believe I stayed around that mess for months. (No, I shouldn't have stayed that long, but I stayed because another player wouldn't leave even though she was miserable--I felt I had to get her out of there. Yeah, misbegotten nobility and all, but she did leave with me in the end.) <br/><br/>The GM's uncle always played the same type of character. Always a noble, with money to burn and lots of underlings to order around and lots and lots of social influence. The NPCs always seemed in awe of him, which was kind of fitting seeing how the GM was already in awe of his uncle. More than anything else, I think it's that total domination by one individual over the GM and the whole game that left such a bad taste in my mouth. Status is emotional, indeed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_115434">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115434/#Comment_115434" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-19T16:14:41+00:00" title="December 19, 2007  4:14PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Landon Darkwood</cite>So it strikes me as kind of a contradictory position, and perhaps more seriously, potentially suggests the player's use of gaming as some kind of...

Our characters are literally catapulted through the narrative by misery and drive. To crunchy gamists, the idea of a player's cyborg eschewing weaponry in favor of a metaphysical grip over human nature doesn't strike right, I'm sure; but I still crushed a hundred souls into a naked singularity, as a gift to a genetically engineered goddess.<br/><br/>Power play has its' place in Narrative play, I'm sure. And, if you think of the philosophical angles of Transhumanism versus Taoist Ego Death as a PvP situation, we play to win, too; we just hug afterwards, and almost always agree that, really, we all won.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_115446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115446/#Comment_115446" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-19T18:16:51+00:00" title="December 19, 2007  6:16PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>I think it can be a lot more healthy than you make it sound.

I'm not knocking on low-risk play, dude - hell, I helped make a game where you fly around in jetpacks and bonk intelligent gorillas off of biplanes. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_115476">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/schlafmanko" title="schlafmanko"><img alt="schlafmanko" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/schlafmanko">schlafmanko</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115476/#Comment_115476" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-19T23:59:40+00:00" title="December 19, 2007 11:59PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 20, 2007 9:01AM by schlafmanko.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Regarding players who like winning and looking bad-ass but not challenges -- Besides how status gaming addresses real life status problems, it seems like part of what's going on may be a difference in the criteria people use to figure out whether they have status and how other groups they've been in have awarded status.  Consuming a constantly reduplicated but basically static spectacle of status (looking cool) is different than approaching status more directly as being about the power you have in unfolding interactions (e.g. winning in a real competition [with your character's enemies]).  Play could be about status symbols but not about power, though they blur together a lot.  <br/><br/>I've never roleplayed for static high status, but it sounds a little like how I used to play Sid Meier games (mostly Colonization, some Civilization) on the computer.  After days where I felt completely beaten down, I'd keep restarting games on new maps and play on a given map only until something went wrong, because what I enjoyed was the sense of primal plenty and endless possibility.  It was about reorienting myself through interacting symbolically with an ideal world.  Meaning I was using them more like a ritual than like a game.  Calling things escapist doesn't quite catch that distinction, since escapism and striving coexist more happily for some players than others, even among players who prefer sim. (of course, there are also openly competitive rituals, but, umm, ignoring those.)    <br/><br/>Thinking that you like strategy or whatnot when actually you don't intrinsically enjoy it can also be an identity practice.  If people you know think that x is cool, you gain status by liking x, too, because it lets you identify with high status members of the group, and because now they count you as being in the group as opposed to one of those losers outside it.  Talking about x that way may continue even after you've switched to a group that isn't defined by x, confusing people in the new group.  (btw to people I know: this is only partly about my gaming preferences)  <br/><br/>Still digesting the rest of the comments.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
