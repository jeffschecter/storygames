Basically, you roll first, and a lot of time that will put a cool spark of *something* in your character. But, if the results are totally contradictory to what you're looking for, or if there's a particular result that you really, *really* want, you can pick something else.<br/><br/>I still think it counts as Random, even though it doesn't totally force you to keep the results: More than often, that thing you land on will immediately set off sparks; and even if you don't keep what you land on, most likely the player is already thinking of her character in a new way.<br/><br/>For example, in the game Double Cross, I was just making a character last week (to try to understand the game). I decided that I kinda wanted a juvenile delinquent student (that is, he rolls with bad crowds, but he's more like an honorable leader than a punk or thug). I picked his job and role, his power set, his individual powers, name, etc. Then, it told me to use RoC to determine things that happened in his life (one major event; I ended up sticking with what I got, which was "Misfortune: I screwed up in some major way, and people remember that event"). <br/><br/>Anyway, the *sparky* bit was when I came to the "RoC to see which major background NPC you know, and also your relationship with them": There's a list of about 20 major NPCs in the setting (and I mean "major" as in "they're in the book", not as in "they're all powerful/have metaplot/etc": One is an elementary school girl, another is a crazy assassin, another is the leader of the "Justice League", yet another is a black marketeer, etc). Anyway, I had already determined that I wanted to pick the relationship with either the badass assassin (where the set relationship is "you hate and fear this person"), or perhaps the leader of the secretive Justice League (where the set relationship is "you look up to this person like a father or brother"). Anyway, I landed on "average but spunky high school girl", where the set relationship was "you're not related by blood, but she's as important to you as a blood sister". My brain went BOOOOOooooooooom, and I mentally rewrote my character that instant (without wanting to, even; it just happened): He's all gruff on the outside, but deeply loves this girl (in a sister-way, not a girlfriend way) his next-door neighboor girl that he grew up with. He goes out of his way to keep her safe, and she's the only one who sees him as a nice, kind guy.<br/><br/>So that's why I like randomness.<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/>-Andy<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227081">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227081/#Comment_227081" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-24T06:43:08+00:00" title="August 24, 2009  6:43AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: migo</cite>Is this Mongoose Traveller or a different one?</blockquote>\nIt is the Mongoose one.

That's sweet.<br/><br/>WHFRP2 has some great random tables (which I think my GM got online, so they might of been fan-made) that led to one of my favorite characters of all time.  My dwarf, Ragnar, rolled "a cadaver" as one of his random starting trappings.  I immediately decided that it was my dead mother, whose bones I carried around in a small coffin chained to my back.  He ended up having conversations with her, getting heavily into drugs (mandrake) because of her, and eventually being killed by her ghost.  All from a random piece of starting equipment.  Before that, Ragnar was pretty much just Dwarfy McAxerson.  I find that random tables are often the spark that can set off the dynamite in your head.  <br/><br/>I've also had very positive experiences with random chargen in ORE games, Traveller (of course), and recently with Hackmaster Basic.<br/><br/>Hackmaster's take on it is really cool because everything starts out random and then you can use build points to massage everything into the configuration that you want.  However, you're rewarded (with more points) if you keep everything random.  Very cool, and it led to another cool character concept for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227124">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227124/#Comment_227124" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-24T08:05:44+00:00" title="August 24, 2009  8:05AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Does unexpectedness count as randomness?

From what I understand, she derived it from the <a href="http://scififantasyfiction.suite101.com/article.cfm/absurd_inspiration" rel="nofollow">Exquisite Corpse</a> surrealist writing exercise.\n<blockquote>The exquisite corpse exercise requires at least three or four people. Write an article and an adjective on the top of a piece of paper, such as "the blue" or "a lovely", and fold the paper so they can't be seen. Pass the paper to the left. Now write a noun on your paper, fold it again so it isn't visible, and pass it again. Continue this with a verb, then another article/adverb pairing, then a noun. Unfold the papers and read them aloud. These sentences can be mined for story ideas or phrases. You can make the sentences more complicated if desired. The game gets its name from the first sentence the Surrealists generated in this way: "The exquisite corpse shall drink the new wine."</blockquote>\nHeck, I wanna try this now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227163">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227163/#Comment_227163" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-24T09:31:35+00:00" title="August 24, 2009  9:31AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Daniel, that reminds me of Chris Chinn's <a href="http://bankuei.wordpress.com/2009/07/06/character-concept-generator/" rel="nofollow">Extended Character Concept Generator</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227181">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227181/#Comment_227181" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-24T10:20:31+00:00" title="August 24, 2009 10:20AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like situation generators like IAWA oracles or in a less full blown way house generation in A song of Ice and Fire.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227386/#Comment_227386" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-24T19:23:42+00:00" title="August 24, 2009  7:23PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd go with unexpectedness counting as randomness.

I don't want to be tied to what the dice say for everything, but sometimes it's fun to play a random person. Either way, I strongly prefer a game to offer non-random options alongside the random so I can make my choice, and the random version should always produce a result that is reasonably equal. I hate the whole 'Roll 3D6 six times' thing because two characters using the same method could have wildly different levels of ability. A better option would be 'Roll 3D6, assign it to one attribute, then subract that number from 21 and assign the result to the next attribute.' Though more complex, it at least means that everyone has the same total number of attribute points.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227590">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227590/#Comment_227590" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-25T11:25:25+00:00" title="August 25, 2009 11:25AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think while D&amp;D's handling of it was pretty bad, 3d6 in order works pretty well with HackMaster, since you get bonus build points to keep the stats you got, which you can devote to increasing the stats a bit. It balances out quite nicely in that aspect. D&amp;D is a bit weird in that it comes from random generation roots but really works best when done in a point buy system, because of how influential high stats are. <br/><br/>Another thing I liked is with Millenium's End, which has 10 stats, and you distribute 25 dice across them, giving 1 to 4 to roll for the stat. You control which stats will be at the higher end, which will be at the middle end, and which ones will be at the lower end, but there's still some randomness. You also don't get the wide difference you do in D&amp;D, you get maybe a 5%-10% variance in ability, so you can still roughly work with your character concept. This method, of distributing 24d6, or doing a 9d6, 8d6, 7d6, 6d6, 5d6, 4d6 arranged as you like across the stats turns out to be pretty fair and actually results in characters with stat bonuses in most places they want them, while still having the potential of an interesting lower stat.<br/><br/>Overall though, if you have to go to ridiculous ends to produce consistent and averaged results, it's best to just not use any sort of random generation. If the randomness produces interesting, useful, and fun results across the board, then it's a valuable system to work with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Quintin%20Stone" title="Quintin Stone"><img alt="Quintin Stone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://rps.net/QS/Images/pipboy-32x32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Quintin%20Stone">Quintin Stone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227595/#Comment_227595" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-25T11:40:56+00:00" title="August 25, 2009 11:40AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            D&amp;D got me to hate randomization in character generation.

A final cluster looks like:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.phreeow.net/Diaspora/Diaspora-cluster-eg2.png" style="float: right;"/><br/><br/>A lot of that information is derived and invented, but the three stats per world (Technology, Environment [still Habitat in this old playtest image], and Resources) establish a skeleton on which the players will lay down story per world. They then draw from this during character generation (by establishing their backgrounds within this cluster) which in turn feeds back into world description. These random bits are the seed from which the setting, the characters, and usually the adventure itself all grow. The linkages between systems are also randomly determined, and these linkages drive the development of political relationships between systems.<br/><br/>Witness, for example, Gravity's Rainbow from that cluster, wholly derived from three random numbers:<br/><br/><i><b>Technology: +4<br/>Habitat: -1<br/>Resources: +0</b><br/><br/>The stories of Gravity's success are many, and is the subject of histories and fictions popular throughout the cluster. Gravity was a technological success, then later it housed the Tyrants; it spawned trade conglomerates, empires, and of course, fulfilled all the dreams that technology could whisper into the imaginations of its inhabitants. Gravity was ascending, and at some point, thousands of years ago, it decided to remake itself. A ringworld would take resources, and it would take time, but that, above all, would show the universe the magnificence of which it was capable. The project was never finished, however, and Gravity's Wheel, as it was to have been called, was only partially built. As it is a thirty-degree arc, Gravity's rainbow, stretches between LaGrange points, providing an amazing amount of territory. And with this space, the people were happy. there was no longer a drive to improve because competition for land, and for space, reduced to almost nothing. Pastoral idealism fills much of the land, along with castles, ruins, remnants of attempted technology, and the evidence of failed experiments. But the arcworld is bleak, and lacks the biodiversity that is told about in stories. And the wonderful technological empires, no longer capable of traveling freely between the stars, are no longer to be seen. The technology exists, and it is still maintained, but in the otherwise empty system (all other planets had been incorporated into the arcword's mass long ago), most visitors are greeted with the rolling countryside, stretching up into the sky. And from the jump point, looking down on the system, one sees only the star and the glistening arc, which is Gravity's Rainbow.<br/><br/>    * Arcworld<br/>    * We should have kept the trees<br/>    * Fatally satisfied</i><br/><br/>And so I think this is where randomness really shines in creation of anything: providing a kernel around which to accrete interesting story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227626">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227626/#Comment_227626" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-25T13:17:53+00:00" title="August 25, 2009  1:17PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ganakagok has randomly dealt Tarot-like cards that are interpreted by the player to come up with aspects of their character, if I recall correctly.<br/><br/>That seems like a really good way of putting randomness in a game: the cards don't determine effectiveness, just provide inspiration for a player to build on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227632/#Comment_227632" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-25T13:27:17+00:00" title="August 25, 2009  1:27PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 25, 2009 1:29PM by Bret_Gillan.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like systems.

Chargen can be a way of teaching the game, as well as setting up for play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228404">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228404/#Comment_228404" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-28T10:51:11+00:00" title="August 28, 2009 10:51AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For all the Traveller love, don't forget: it was the only game I'd read at the time (mid-eighties) where your character could DIE during generation.

At least in classic Traveller. Not that I'm defending death during character generation -- removing it is probably one of the earliest examples of an RPG house rule in existence.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228572">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228572/#Comment_228572" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-29T07:49:54+00:00" title="August 29, 2009  7:49AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I kind of liked the death option, if you had a shitty character, you could try to die.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_228842">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228842/#Comment_228842" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-31T04:14:26+00:00" title="August 31, 2009  4:14AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I gotta toss in another vote for Reign's one-roll character creation.
