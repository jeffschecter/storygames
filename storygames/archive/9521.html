One aesthetic I'm adopting is keeping things historically plausible, so we're not having Gadgets and Artefacts.  Most of the changes to SotC as written are minor, but Guns are quite different.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the 1840s, all guns are single-shot muzzle loaders*.  That means that reload times for guns are significant.  What's the best way to incorporate this in the game?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy first thought was to simply say characters have to spend an action or two reloading a gun.  Does that sound fair?  Does anyone have any other suggestions?  On the one hand, I want to reflect that guns aren't as effective then as they are later; on the other hand, I don't want to make Guns a completely useless skill.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther changes needed: Guns can't be used for suppressive fire block actions, the Rain of Lead stunt doesn't exist, and Fast Reload needs changing, but I'm not sure how yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil.<br/>\n<br/>\n* what revolvers there are don't seem to be reliable enough for serious use.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211254">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211254/#Comment_211254" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-10T03:36:40+00:00" title="June 10, 2009  3:36AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd go one of two ways:<br/>\n<br/>\na) Make the reload times so long that it's impractical to use in most ocmbats, but give guns a big bonus: cross of multiple stress boxes when they hit, or inflict automatic consequences and corss off the related stress box (so if you rolled 5 or 6 damage, that would be a Severe Consequence, and the 5or 6 stress box).<br/>\n<br/>\nb) Have it take one round to reload a gun, but assume this was a manoeuvre to give you the one-use free aspect: "Only One Shot, but it HURTS when it hits!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211277">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WillH" title="WillH"><img alt="WillH" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v488/Telpierion/minitardisicon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WillH">WillH</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211277/#Comment_211277" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-10T07:45:15+00:00" title="June 10, 2009  7:45AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just use the standard rules.

Spirit of the Century is geared towards very powerful PCs who can pull off stunts that would be unbelievable in any "normal" setting - with stunts like Ricochet, Faster Than A Leopard, and Right Place, Right Time I wouldn't find it out of place for the characters to be able to reload a single shot between rounds as part of the combat round.  Personally, I think I'd just leave it the way it is.<br><br>However, if that still seems weird to you, then I think <b>demiurgeastaroth</b> is headed in the right direction.  Maybe you need to make a reload maneuver to reload between shots, but the Fast Reload stunt allows you to avoid that and shoot every turn.  In exchange, the guns do a little bit more damage, such as 1 or 2 additional stress on a successful hit to make them worthwhile to use, but to balance that maybe you have a -1 to your roll because they are inaccurate.  If you do that, then you'll end up with what I personally envision as the way they were used then (and this could be totally wrong) - average characters use the guns for one good shot before dropping them and rushing in with swords and fists.  That makes the Fast Reload stunt really powerful, so maybe chain it after a new stunt that negates the -1 penalty to Guns rolls.<br><br>If you went this way then non-gun characters will use them on occasion but not really focus on them at all, but Gun skill characters will be able to pick up a bit more damage with one stunt and be able to reload without a maneuver with 2 stunts.  Does that seem balanced to you?                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211313">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike" title="Steerpike"><img alt="Steerpike" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/73053145/4961238"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike">Steerpike</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211313/#Comment_211313" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-10T09:16:07+00:00" title="June 10, 2009  9:16AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I say the best way to handle this is with a setting/world aspect like "Muzzle Loading Guns are Inconvient" or something.

If I need to spend a few rounds gathering Temporary Aspects via Maneuvering or waste rounds not doing anything for some bonus like extra damage, then why bother when I can just punch you with Fists several times or just stab you with Weapons? I could even spend a few rounds doing some cool maneuvers with those skills to gain some Temporary Aspects and the punch/stab just as well if not better then the slow Gun. And with prob more fun as rolling the dice, describing your actions and tagging aspects are way more fun then waiting to shoot.<br><br>If you want someone with a Bandoleer of Pistols, firing and dropping them, then that sounds like an awesome Aspect in my opinion.<br><br>If you still want to go with the reload times, then I suggest giving guns several world aspects like "Slow", "Powerful" or "Deadly" and let all gun users tag them for extra on their rolls. And then I would include a free stunt for all guns like "With a successful hit, player may spend 1 Fate to deal a consequence regardless of remaining stress"<br><br>- Colin                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil" title="Neil"><img alt="Neil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil">Neil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211575/#Comment_211575" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-11T05:51:41+00:00" title="June 11, 2009  5:51AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite>SOTC is a genre emulation game, not a realism game.</blockquote>\nYep, I get that.

The if you want set up guns with 3 rounds to reload, maybe let them make a Guns roll with shifts reducing the time and then add a few world Aspects to re-enforce this and let the players earn Fate for working within the genre constraints you want to use. Stuff like "Blocks of Infantry", "Guns are for the Battlefield, Steel is for when it is Personal" and the like. One of SotC's strengths is in the way you can use Aspects to Co-opt the players into the genre emulation stuff. <br/><br/>- Colin                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
