We started small\u2026 less than 20 people, and are now between 150-180 people. What worked for 20 people, didn't work for 150. <br/><br/><b>@ 20 people: </b><br/><br/>We simply showed up, pitched games, and started playing!<br/><br/>For people who were shy, this wasn't ideal but there were so few of us we could make sure everyone got what they wanted.<br/><br/><b>@ 40 people: </b><br/><br/>We switched to online registration. <br/><br/>It was fast but unfriendly for people who didn't visit our website. People started bringing their co-workers, friends, significant others\u2026 often people who didn't game ever or regularly and we loved it! We wanted to make Recess friendly to new people. And even veterans were a bit burned out on the Gen Con advanced online registration rush. <br/><br/><b>@ 60 people: </b><br/><br/>We ditched online registration and inspired by Dreamation, posted our events to a wall where people could simply signup for games themselves. We added a rule that scheduled games couldn't require previous experience and that the GMs would teach rules as needed to make Recess even more friendly to new people.<br/><br/>It worked well. 60 wasn't too large where crowding was an issue. But as we attracted more and more casual gamers, not everyone showed up on time. This meant not only did you have less options to choose from but you were sometimes locked out of afternoon games as well\u2026 since we put up all the games, for all the time slots in the morning.<br/><br/><b>@ 80 people: </b><br/><br/>We kept the wall self-registration system but only put up the games for the next immediate time slot. So if you were only coming for the afternoon, the game didn't fill up in the morning. Everyone had an equal chance as long as you showed up before the time slot you wanted to play in. <br/><br/>Splitting game signups between timeslots was great! But at 80 people, the rush to signup became a little awkward. People formed crowds, would add all their friend's names to a game (immediately filling up the game), and in 2 atypical situations\u2026 crossed someone else's name off of a game to add their own! Not cool! <br/><br/><b>@ 100 people: </b><br/><br/>We retired self-registration. We still kept morning and afternoon registration separate. But we had staff members sign people up for their chosen games. This had the added benefit that people were available to answer any questions. Additionally, we printed the games to large posters so everyone on line could clearly see what was still available: <br/><img alt="image" src="http://nerdnyc.com/FTP/recess_01152011_photos_web/18.jpg"/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://nerdnyc.com/FTP/recess_01152011_photos_web/19.jpg"/><br/><br/><b><a href="/forums/profile/140%2B">@140+</a> people: </b><br/><br/>No changes were made but the lines became an issue. The afternoon line was especially long. Signups were actually fast\u2026 you didn't have to wait on the line long\u2026 but the initial line was discouraging for new people just showing up. The other issue is that attendees wanting a specific game got in line earlier and earlier creating an enormous queue. Anticipating this, others got into the line even earlier! It also meant some people didn't go out to lunch together or socialize as much because they wanted to get in line as early as possible. We tried easing this by having games people could play in line where they won prizes but although fun, was a bandaid solution. <br/><br/><b>Next: </b><br/><br/>The next evolution we're experimenting with in 2 weeks is semi-random game tickets. <br/><br/>When you pay admission, you will be given a game ticket with a number on it. When game signups start, we will call people by number to signup. There will be no reason to wait in line or arrive to game signups early. Additionally, if you are with a dependant or significant other, we will add +1 to your game ticket so you can signup together. And to make it so that the first person to pay admission doesn't end up with ticket <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23100&amp;Mode=like">#100</a>, we are going to make it semi-random by starting with a small pool of low numbered tickets and adding more tickets as the pool runs out (we will keep a few random tickets in reserve for people who arrive only for afternoon games).<br/><br/>Edit: I forgot to mention, we're also dedicating an entire room to open gaming. Not everyone wants to play or run scheduled games. So we hope to facilitate the feeling of a small convention within a larger one. <br/><br/><b>The future: </b><br/><br/>We have a few ideas but it depends how much we grow (we try our best from growing too large too fast). What I've learned is that no one system works for everyone. It depends on your goals, your audience, and the size of your event.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_328211">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328211/#Comment_328211" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-07T10:41:05+00:00" title="June  7, 2011 10:41AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 7, 2011 10:41AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Camp Nerdly (<a href="/forums/profile/50">@50</a> participants) usually has people pitch games in advance on the wiki and solicit informal commitments.

I understand that some of the people involved will have no trouble following this process, but it sounds remarkably complicated -- even if you were to do it well in advance. Or maybe I'm just having a viscerally negative reaction to the idea of 'buying' a seat in a game -- yuck.<br/><br/>Personally I heavily, heavily favour an informal process similar to the first year of Go Play NW and this year's Fabricated Realities. I acknowledge that it would probably become unwieldy above 50 people, but frankly that's just all the better reason to not attend giant cons if I can help it.<br/><br/>The hybrid of last year's GoPlayNW was also pretty solid -- with physical signup sheets to allow for some prearranged games, but also a 'get everyone who doesn't have a game in the same spot and pitch stuff/distribute players' going on in parallel -- and seemed to effectively accommodate a larger number of attendees.<br/><br/>I hate online signups for the same reason I hate having to wake up at 8am to stand in line at a website to buy concert tickets.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_328249">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/forlorn1" title="forlorn1"><img alt="forlorn1" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/n6SIEC3F01EX7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/forlorn1">forlorn1</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328249/#Comment_328249" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-07T13:13:33+00:00" title="June  7, 2011  1:13PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really like using the ConPlanner software from the Fear the Con guys (its free and very well done), along with a forum to schedule games in advance.  For FTC you'd post your game idea on the forum to gauge interest.  If you felt it would go, you could then put it up on the schedule.  At the con proper they used the Dreamation/Dexcon sign up sheets on poster board method.  This year it peaked at about 200 people.

(Note: I still had lots of fun at the con in question, but that feeling, however unjustified, was not great.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_328257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328257/#Comment_328257" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-07T13:40:40+00:00" title="June  7, 2011  1:40PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We've gone through quite an evolution at Go Play NW as well. My memory is probably a bit faulty, so GPNW alums, please chime in and correct me!<br/><br/>In <b>2007</b> we had an informal discussion regarding games to run and play starting a couple months before the event. I think the discussion as via wiki, which was not conducive to clarity in who was running or playing what. At the con we had a blackboard where people could put up games to run or sign up to play in them. Before each slot we had an informal pitch session by GMs looking for players. You could sign up for games a few slots ahead as well.<br/><br/>The result was chaotic but generally worked "good enough" to meet our needs. There was a breakdown though where people chimed in to play a game on the forum, only to find it full of newcomers at the con. The pitch sessions were also pretty chaotic and it was apparent they wouldn't scale well.<br/><br/>Honestly <b>2008</b> is a bit of blur to me. We had a forum for people to offer games and gather players, which we printed out verbatim and posted on a wall at the con. There were also blank pages for GMs to offer games with space for players to sign up.<br/><br/>Because this was our second year, a lot of people knew what to expect, which reduced the chaos. The forum threads were pretty hard to parse, though, and it wasn\u2019t always clear who was in what game.<br/><br/>In <b>2009</b> we did something similar. We tried to apply a bit more organization to how the game sign-up forums were organized, and I think it helped. We posted game sign-up sheets on a wall listing pre-scheduled games with space for GMs to add new sheets throughout the weekend. GPNW was bigger in 2009, and there was also a definite shift to pre-scheduled games. The forum created a perception that these were the meat of the con, so some people started out already disappointed that they were missing out on games that had filled up. The pitch sessions were also sometimes in danger of being overwhelmed with people.<br/><br/>In <b>2010</b> we planned to grow a lot (100 people total), and we refined the hell out of how we handle game sign up accordingly. For pre-scheduled games, we told GMs that it would be their job to organize the game via forum and give us a list of who was playing, which made it much easier for us to create the schedule. We also communicated to people that ad-hoc gaming is a very important part of the event so that newcomers would know what to expect. Games were posted to a wall, as in previous years.<br/><br/>We also replaced the informal pitch session with the "pickup donut", which <a href="http://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/169/lottery-the-pickup-donut/" rel="nofollow">Ben Robbins describes very well on his blog</a>. This took a lot of the chaos and uncertainty out of the ad-hoc gaming, especially when the crowd was large. <br/><br/>In 2010 I think we did a better job than ever of helping people put games together and have a good time. We'll be using essentially the same methods for 2011. Communicating to people what you expect of them and what you are taking responsibility for as an organizer is essential!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_328259">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328259/#Comment_328259" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-07T13:52:52+00:00" title="June  7, 2011  1:52PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For the record, 2009 was the year where I ended up feeling somewhat alienated (as described above) -- arriving at the con to see only completely-full games, complete with a print-out of the 'sign up' thread from the forum, was a bit of a shock after previous years. Especially since the forum printouts were timestamped, making it clear that every game had basically filled up within 2-4 hours of being posted, and often by the same group of players (not a slam against those players, they were just online and paying attention at the time.) I thought 2008 was much better, even though it did almost the same thing -- probably because the online signup just ended up being a much lower percentage of the total games.<br/><br/>2010 was a big improvement, even though I once again avoided online sign-ups -- wasn't there a (possibly informal) rule that a game could not be completely filled online, but had to leave 1-2 slots open for con-day signups? In any case I think the ratio of 'organized beforehand' vs. 'organized at the con' was much more balanced in 2010, which seems really key to me. The donut was also great, and was of course mirrored in the Mushroom King roundup at Fabricated Realities. I think the fact that the donut was very clearly presented as 'A Cool Thing' -- that was being tweaked and talked about over the weekend -- really stomped on any notions that this might be the 'leftovers' part of the event. I remember lots of people who had full games still showing up to watch the Donut, just because they were curious what else was being run, or how it was getting put together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_328263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman" title="Ross_Cowman"><img alt="Ross_Cowman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2VVx8Kc--zY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACZ8/3Pco6NeJ4Ng/photo.jpg?sz=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman">Ross_Cowman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328263/#Comment_328263" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-07T14:07:31+00:00" title="June  7, 2011  2:07PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Pre-reg creates this feeling of scarcity for me.

The board has varied from all weekend shown at once to individual sessions, with the latter appearing more optimal.<br/><br/>Not sure if that's what happened this year, but that's been the model in the past, generally.</blockquote>\nIt sounded like there were some scheduling problems this year but without being there I can't comment. I know this informal scheduling style didn't work for me when I attended the early Forge Cons. Partially because I didn't know a lot of people there at first and many people who knew each other sometimes made plans to play together in advance. This was rarely the case for me at Camp Nerdly, but I also knew many of the attendees (as opposed to Forge Con). <br/><br/>Part of the reason we moved away from this style at Recess early on was because even though it worked for most people when we were around 40, there were always people who felt left out and uncomfortable. We mitigated this by assigning people the responsibility of wrangling players. If someone looked lost or unsure, we always had someone who would help them. But being a wrangler was tough! <br/><br/>It's kind of like freeform roleplaying! With the right players, it's great. But if the chemistry is off, or you don't have the right mix of people, someone is going to feel frustrated and sometimes this dynamic is unfriendly to "outsiders". The GM, if you have the right GM, can compensate for a lot of this but they don't catch everything!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_328275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328275/#Comment_328275" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-07T14:54:51+00:00" title="June  7, 2011  2:54PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 7, 2011 2:57PM by zircher.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Fear the Boot guys wrote up something called ConPlanner that they use for Fear the Con (and is available for other events.)

This way people who want to attend have multiple chances and the general attendance numbers stay relatively low. If we get to 200, we might consider running Recess more often.<br/><br/>Here's an idea! <br/><br/>For our goals, relying completely on online pre-registration doesn\u2019t work. But that doesn't mean we couldn't use it partially. If we ever reach 200+ attendees, what we could do is hold online pre-registration for half the available tickets for the events. So if a game supports 6 players, you can pre-signup for 3 of those player slots.

So far we've found that at event where there are scheduled games (that are easy to sign up for) and open gaming (that's a bit more fuzzy and uncertain), people flock to scheduled games. Not everyone. Often GMs and people who show up after a time slot has started are happy to take a risk with open gaming. Partly because open gaming hasn't evolved to the same point as scheduled games in terms of support. The other part is people seem less interested in paying admission for open gaming when they can use the community to organize games whenever they want.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_328290">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328290/#Comment_328290" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-07T15:42:59+00:00" title="June  7, 2011  3:42PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That makes sense.<br/><br/>At our locol Con (maybe 70-80 people?) the Games on Demand room has been slowly growing within the con, like a cancer colonising its host and taking control of its critical functions.

That hasn't been my experience, but I can see how it would happen.<br/><br/>Here's how we run Games on Demand, the cancer that is slowly colonising CapCon in Wellington:<br/><br/>There are six to eight "hosts" who agree to be available to run games for anything from 1 to the full 6 sessions of the Con. Usually that means 4 or so hosts available at any one slot. At the start of the slot, we each pitch a game or two that we're willing to run, and take suggestions from the floor if someone is really keen to play something that hasn't been pitched. Once the pitches are done, we gauge how many people are available and keen for each game, and fire off full games to a play room as soon as they're loaded. Usually there'll be a few stragglers left who didn't volunteer for anything or who gave up their first choice to someone more excited or demanding. Any leftover hosts whose pitches didn't get picked up organise with them to play something, which might be one of the pitched games, or it might be something totally different. Often these are the best games, for some reason.<br/><br/>Before the Con, all the hosts prepare four or five games that they'll be able to run, or fewer if it's a low-prep game. So I might go along with a Dogs town prepped, an Apocalypse World hack I can bust out as many times as needed, and having read and planned for Steal Away Jordan, should the opportunity present itself. That means the hosts are usually pretty well-prepared to run a game, and if we've been strong-armed into running something we don't know very well, we'll be up front about that. <br/><br/>The system has been developed over a few years, and is getting better each time. It's not perfect, and as we get more people it will need to change, but we can handle 20-30 people pretty efficiently and effectively this way, and with more hosts we could expand to 40-50 pretty easily, I think. The key is to give people a few good choices, only one vote on what they want to play, and then fire them off quick once they're sorted. That stops dithering and people jumping in and out of groups to try to get their ideal game and group of players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_328359">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328359/#Comment_328359" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-07T19:55:25+00:00" title="June  7, 2011  7:55PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh!

GMs turn up, fill out a sheet, and plonk it on the sign-up sheet table. People sign up for games as they appear. No pre-registration, partly because it's unfair on those who aren't in the right place at the right time, but mostly because I can't be bothered to sort out all the paperwork and deal with the grief when I get it wrong (or right). It's all very casual, and now deliberately so: people say they appreciate the casual, informal nature of the day, so we're keeping the initial casual feel.<br/><br/>Saying that, we encourage people to announce beforehand the games they want to run, and we put them online. People get asked/persuaded to run particular games, and there are a few (very few) instances of people asking GMs to prebook them into a game. But generally, people respect the notion that the on-site sign-up system is fair to all concerned.<br/><br/>Most UK cons seem to work in a similar manner. Some of the big freeform games ("parlour larps", I think, for the USAians) do pre-con signups, but that's mainly so people can arrange frockage.<br/><br/><small>[*] Shameless plug: 17 September, Milton Keynes, UK, hope to see you there.</small> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_328429">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328429/#Comment_328429" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-08T07:23:18+00:00" title="June  8, 2011  7:23AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan, good point! I definitely have seen people run games without prep and have a great time. Especially when the person is passionate about the game in question. I also haven't been to any of the Seattle conventions which I hear great things about.<br/><br/>In general when I've had positive experiences at on demand events, it's either been because I'm playing with the game's designer, playing with someone who has a lot of experience with a game, we're playing a game with really simple and easy to reference rules, or we are all on board taking a chance on something that's risky. <br/><br/>What I've had happen too often is people come to a table with a 3-5 games and ask, "which one do you want to play?" And then start reading the rules as if it's a boardgame where we can get started after 10 minutes of quick rule browsing. I've had this happen with Capes, Agon, With Great Power, Bliss Stage, Dirty Secrets, and In a Wicked Age. That all said, the suggestions Simon posted about pitching games would eliminate these problems. <br/><br/>Also, to be fair, when I sign up for games at Gen Con, I tend to do research. Often the game descriptions will specify the GM and have a link to their website. There are even gaming collectives that run games at Gen Con with great reputations. I know what to signup for and what to stay away from. But that came with experience. If you were to blindly signup for events at Gen Con and randomly hit up Games on Demand\u2026 which would on average produce more fun? Probably Games on Demand. But since I'm willing to do a little research, scheduled events tend to give me the most bang for my buck. But research is probably an unreasonable expectation for many people. Gen Con also generally doesn't screen their events and the barrier of entry is low.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_328431">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328431/#Comment_328431" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-08T07:28:37+00:00" title="June  8, 2011  7:28AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I enjoyed Concrete Cow.

And the fact that you don't even know if you're in an event an hour before it could start makes planning a little frustrating.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_328509">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Olson" title="Mike_Olson"><img alt="Mike_Olson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Olson">Mike_Olson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328509/#Comment_328509" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-08T12:37:37+00:00" title="June  8, 2011 12:37PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 8, 2011 2:03PM by Mike_Olson.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>Mike, what kind of crossover do you get between Saturday and Sunday?</blockquote>\nThere's a pretty significant drop-off, but still enough that we can have, say, Bang!, Settlers, and Dominion all going on at once.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Macklin</cite><br/>I see community at the LA conventions, where the RPG contingent is small enough to be communal, large enough to be interesting. </blockquote>\nIt's gotten to the point at the Strategicons where I almost never game with people I don't know unless I make an effort to do so. I'm not opposed to it or anything, although it certainly comes with a risk factor. It's just that the games I want to play are usually the games that all those people want to play in too, and the games I run tend to attract a subset of the same group.<br/><br/>Apart from one or two exceptions, my only truly bad experiences gaming with strangers at Strategicons over the past six or seven years were a couple RPGA games, so... easily avoided.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_328512">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328512/#Comment_328512" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-08T12:51:20+00:00" title="June  8, 2011 12:51PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just a note - this conversation (and the parallel one I started) is really informative, so thanks John, and thanks everyone who chipped in so far.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Game signups @ Cons: how? - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14434/game-signups-cons-how/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Game signups @ Cons: how? - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14434/game-signups-cons-how/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Posted By: jenskot2.

Each attendee was assigned into one of five races (Dwarf, Elf, Human, Orc, Troll) during the keynote before the games started.  For each slot, there was a ranked priority list for the races.  If your race was the <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> priority for a given slot, you were guaranteed a seat at the game of your choosing for that slot.  If your race was <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> priority for a slot, there was a pretty good chance you'd get a seat for the game you wanted as long as that game didn't fill up with <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231-priority&amp;Mode=like">#1-priority</a> players.  And so on.</p>\n<p>Everyone had a turn at being the best through worse priority during the con.  This guaranteed that there would be at least one slot for which you got your top pick.  Even being <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> priority wasn't too bad, as you'd usually get into what you wanted.  When it was your turn as lowest priority, you would just look around the room for games with insufficient numbers of players.  It also let you plan out your games in advance, as you knew your priority for each slot once the con started.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14434/game-signups-cons-how" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14434/game-signups-cons-how" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14434/game-signups-cons-how/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F14434%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F14434%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
