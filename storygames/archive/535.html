                    Okay, since when registering it's suggested you start a thread on something, here's mine.<br/>
<br/>
I have come to the conclusion that playing a role, that is that the players are meant to take on the persona of a person in the fictional world is one of the worst things to ever happen to the hobby.<br/>
<br/>
This is likely to spark all kinds of responses. But I would like you to consider before responding. I do not post this lightly nor am I just trying to stir up trouble.  So work from there.                </div>

I think it's pretty fun to sometimes take on the persona during play.                        </div>

                            I think the assumption of a unified "hobby" is probably the most problematic part of the statement.  Cause in some of my games, that's terrible shit, yeah; in other games, that's totally awesome.<br/>

<p>Funny enough, I think I generally know what Jack means without being filled in.</p>
<p>"Play this game ... at the same time, maintain a consistent character of X, Y and Z description" ... that's two activities.  Or, more accurately, it's one activity and one creative constraint.</p>
<p>Creative constraints can inspire creativity, if you let them.  If you say "Hrmmm ... I want this guy to weep like a baby now, but he's a hardened marine.  That's gonna require real creativity!  Oh, wait!  I've got the perfect thing!" then you're totally welcome at my table.  You've engaged your brain, and you're using your constraints to do <em>better</em>.</p>
<p>If you say "Hrm... I want this guy to weep like a baby, but he's a hardened marine, so I guess I can't do that," then you're wimping out on me.  You've given your brain <em>one pass</em> at the problem, and then you're using your creative constraints as an excuse not to try any hard than that.</p>
<p>It is ironic that a constraint that can be (in the right hands) roleplaying's greatest strength is (in the wrong hands) also its greatest weakness.</p>

<p>Everyone's asking "what do you mean by 'the hobby', but my first question was "what do you mean by 'playing a role'?"</p>
<p>If you mean making decisions about a fictional character based on the constraints Tony's talking about, I have no problem with that. If you mean talking and acting in character, then maybe I have a problem. I will occasionally talk in character, or say "I do X" the way my character would, but most of the time I don't. I just talk in third person about what my character does and says. And I find that I get annoyed when people talk in character too much, or play-act all their character's actions.</p>
<p>I'm just not at the table for <em>acting</em>.</p>
<p>Is that the worst thing that ever happened to the hobby. Well, maybe. I'm willing to let the actors go and be actors in their games, while people like me can play without the postures. I think LARP is the best thing that happened to the hobby, because maybe the actors will vent their acting desires in LARPs and I don't have to witness it.</p>
<p>I think the <em>worst</em> thing that ever happened to the hobby is that we should all do the same thing.</p>

                            Tony, working with your example, I think you've hit on two different levels of role-playing.  One is where you get completely into character, thinking of how you want your character to react to a situation, then figuring out how they would *actually* respond to a situation.  The other is just playing the surface.  For example:<br/>
<br/>
you want your hardened marine to cry like a baby, but he's a hardened marine, so what would he do instead?  Punch the bulkhead of his ship, let out a grunt/yell of frustration, then keep going.  (I'm assuming he's not crying out of fear, but for some other reason, like his best friend just died horribly and he found the body.)<br/>
<br/>
you want your hardened marine to cry like a baby, but he's a hardened marine, so he doesn't.<br/>
<br/>
I think this difference is part of what Jack is talking about.  I don't know his experiences, but the former is a great deal more difficult to do as a player than the latter.  It also changes the point of the game.  If the goal of your game is to run around, killing monsters, solving puzzles, saving towns, then the deep emotional basis of your character detracts from the main purpose of the game and makes you lose focus of the ultimate goal.  This is not true for all people, but for some.  Deep characterisation also takes away from group play, as it focuses everything on only one character for as much time as it takes to get it sorted out, if it's role-played.  It can also slow down game-play because you have to think about all these character flaws and histories before you can make a decision as to how your character would react.  Take my example above, it takes a lot less time to think of the second than the first.<br/>
<br/>
All that being said, I'm a fan of deep characterisation and find the best games i've played are those where most or all players go at least to the level of my first example.  Some games I've played go way way beyond that, and that's an extreme that I find off-putting simply because it's not all about that character.<br/>
<br/>
So while I support it, I can see why some people would not like it.<br/>

                            Jack, that clarifies a lot.  I agree with a lot of what you say.  However, sometimes the lack of immersion slows down play.  If you're in your characters head and know them intimately, then you can make the split-second decisions that are sometimes needed.  When you're not, you have to muddle, sometimes for several minutes about whether or not your character would actually do that.  I know I have.  Is it worth this lag to avoid the ruination of immersion?<br/>

<p><code>Tony, working with your example, I think you've hit on two different levels of role-playing. One is where you get completely into character, thinking of how you want your character to react to a situation, then figuring out how they would *actually* respond to a situation. The other is just playing the surface.</code></p>
<p>Hrm.  That sounds a lot like you're saying that getting completely into character is a creative expression, and that anything else <em>isn't</em>.</p>
<p>I'm just double checking before I start railing about what utter bullshit that is.  Have I read you correctly?</p>

Meh. <br/><br/>I think that the incidence of 'true immersionism' is vanishingly small in most RPG play - if only because you need to negotiate the gamespace and the shared imagined space simultaneously.<br/><br/>I don't think it's a bad idea to stress that you should consider the SIS from the character's PoV.  After all, the R in RPG is for 'role', not 'pawn'.<br/><br/>But I'm with Brand on the True Wrongism.  The only thing that's bad for gaming is the idea that there's one form or another which is inherently badwrongfun.                        </div>

                            I think Tony is spot on. Here's why:<br/>
<br/>
When you get to a particular decision point about your character, you decide how they act. You make up something about the character in that very moment. The character has never been in this exact same situation before. The character could act in accordance with other decisions they've made before, or in a different way. Either way, however, you're making up something new about the character at that moment. It's either "He's also a hardened marine in this case" or "This is an exception."<br/>
<br/>
I could also say it as "I hereby decide that there is nothing in his background/personality that would make him cry" versus "I hereby decide that there is something in his background/personality that would make him cry." Both are authoritarial. Both mean the player makes a choice and determines something new about the character. Neither is more or less "playing the character" than the other.<br/>
<br/>
Framing the difference as playing the character versus changing the character to fit the player's interest is a false dichotomy that's plagued rpg discussions for a long time.                        </div>

<p>Opinions are like assholes. I have many of them.</p>
<p>(note: I posted the preceding line to my <em>own</em> LJ a couple days ago with the comment that I couldn't think of any place to use the line. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to insert it irrelevantly here.)</p>
<p>Anyways, I kind of thought Immersion was what you were getting at, and I'm not really an immersionist, so I have some sympathy with your viewpoint... but I'd rather say that Immersion is a separate activity, discovered by roleplayers, which really should have branched off into a different kind of game entirely, leaving roleplaying to its own devices.</p>

<i>I don't think it's a bad idea to stress that you should consider the SIS from the character's PoV.</i><br/><br/>Ah, I knew I forgot a point of three when I wrote that. Let's just say there is a difference between considering things from the characters POV and mistaking focusing on the character's POV to the exclusion of most other considerations because that's how to really get involved in the prceedings.                        </div>

                            I have said and written for years that the only character we can play in roleplaying games is ourselves. Our characters are defined by ourselves; either as a reaction to or an integration of elements of our own personality. Immersion is in my opinion the purest form of intellectual dishonesty.<br/><br/>I no more believe I am a knight than I believe Joe Pesci is a criminal, no matter how good his performance.                        </div>

                            You know, the thing about this is I'm of two minds on the issue, and figuring out how they fit together.

Suppose a creature had the power to burrow into the brain and come to know an individual completelyÃ¢â‚¬â€dreams, fears, strength, weakness. Suppose that this Mind Worm also had the power to cause events in the world. It could then create a specific happening geared to the unique nature of that person that would trigger a one-of-a-kind adventure, a quest that would force him to use himself to the limit, to live to his deepest and fullest.
