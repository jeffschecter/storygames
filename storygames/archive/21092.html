When you just get Fast-Talked by the town guard to reveal the secret location of your friends hide out, you lose agency, there's a time gap, there's a "what happened" gap, there's a "No I wouldn't do that" thing going on.<br/><br/>But in a more step by step system, three things are going on.<br/>First, your argument is being broken down (whether it'll be by pure arguing as in pet/gra, or by a combination of arguing and rolls as in BW). You can see how your character would <b>think</b> something but being able to <b>argue</b> for that thing.<br/><br/>Second, those games all employ stance-altering mechanisms. In BW/FC/Diaspora, the hypermechanization create a pawn stance feel, in SaKVal / Dramasystem the beast commands and tokens create an author stance feel. The mechanics are well suited for gradually slowly gliding from stance to stance without being jarred. But when you're just Fast-Talked with a single roll, you don't get the chance to softly make that transition, you're just dumped in ice water and then back in the fire again. "No, the guard talked you out of all your money and now you're out in the woods in the cold and you didn't get in, what do you do?" That<br/>might seem awesome, like a seed for great play -- <em>if</em> you're in the right stance, if it happens to "your character" and not "you". I.e. in Fiasco, when someone is waving a black die in your face, it's very clearly a "Wouldn't it be more interesting if your character failed right now" rather than "Wouldn't it be more interesting if <em>you</em> failed right now?"<br/><br/>Third, the zoomed in detail, the focus on blow-by-blow, makes the outcomes more reasonable. If there's no way to break down into detail how the goblin talks you into jumping into the lava head first, then that outcome won't be on the table. Diaspora sorta falters on this point, and arguably the first too, but do the second point very well; the <em>outcome</em> is a literal pawn.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462573">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462573/#Comment_462573" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-28T10:50:17+00:00" title="April 28, 2017 10:50AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 28, 2017 10:50AM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited April 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Solid analysis. One thing I'll add is that I use social mechanics against PCs routinely with conflict resolution scope as well, and although a small minority of players never accepts it, most do. I believe this to be a cultural artifact more than a necessary problem. Pendragon players have accepted it for ages that their control over their own character is not automaton-like when passions and human frailty are concerned.<br/><br/>The crux of the technical delivery in using social mechanics on PCs is, I've found, to preface the result narration with an internal exploration of what's going on with the PC, depicting their decision in understandable terms. Like so:<br/><br/><b>Wrong way</b><br/><br/>Player: I rolled a '1', oh no!<br/>GM: She seduces you and against your good sense you tell her everything. One is left to wonder how you could ever be so stupid.<br/><br/><b>Right way</b><br/><br/><b>Player:</b> I rolled a '1', oh no!<br/><b>GM:</b> She succeeds in giving you a positive and hopeful impression of herself. I imagine that it must be quite a relief to meet a friendly face here, and one who does not want anything from you aside from companionship. Over several hours of tete-a-tete you have an opportunity to think of something else for a change. Being as how she is not related to your business in any way, it does no harm to talk over your problems with your new friend. You feel much better about everything at the end.<br/><br/>With players who have a soul and therefore do not require a hopeless amount of hand-holding, I can even do this:<br/><br/><b>Player:</b> I rolled a '1', oh no!<br/><b>GM:</b> She succeeds in giving you a positive and hopeful impression of herself. I imagine you spend the evening together, talking and enjoying each other's company. How do you end up spilling your secrets to her? Is it that you do not realize that she could possibly have anything to do with your business, or does wine and lust get you to take leave of your senses, or what?<br/><b>Player:</b> Oh, I guess... To tell the truth, I have been finding this whole city kind of oppressive. It feels like people only work here, so I am delighted to finally start figuring out what it is that one's supposed to be doing with their free time. Plus, it's not like I have lots of experience in being an independent adult - a pretty stranger paying attention to me rings all sorts of bells, and frankly, speaking purely existentially, makes my business problems seem rather insignificant in comparison. I think that I tell her everything in an effort to impress her with the kind of work I do.<br/><br/>That latter bit is, of course, simply the buy-in trick in action: players enjoy events more when you get buy-in first, so it's consensual. Doesn't work if the player does not buy into the dice determining the direction of a scene top-down (that is, task resolution brain damage prevents them from following the rules), but if they do accept the conceit, it's generally easy to let them narrate their own downfall; after all, the dice already show what's going to happen, so now we'll need to figure out in detail how that outcome could possibly come about with my particular character. I better think up something human and understandable, that doesn't make my character into someone I hate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462575/#Comment_462575" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-28T11:12:49+00:00" title="April 28, 2017 11:12AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Eero!<br/>The second right way seems a <b>lot</b> more palatable than the first "right" way.

I agree that stance-switching has a role to play in this kind of dynamic.<br/><br/>I'll point out another thing:<br/><br/>As Eero says, much of this is "culture of play" stuff, not fundamental "roleplaying theory" stuff. <br/><br/>This means that it's encouraged and enforced by a lot of <i>indirect pressures and incentives</i>: not just the mechanics in play, but also the attitudes of the players (as Eero's example demonstrates), and the <i>larger context</i> of the game being played.<br/><br/>Does the table mood/culture and the larger context of the game encourage us to buy into our characters' helplessness sometimes?<br/><br/>In your examples, <i>Fiasco</i> primes us to be looking forward to seeing our characters do stupid things, be gullible, or be easily fooled. <i>Pendragon</i> puts our characters' lack of control front-and-center, before you even start playing. Similarly, if I'm excited about the premise of my character being a monster and waking up one morning, only to be unsure about what I've done, <i>of course</i> I'll go along with some clever vampire hypnotizing me. That's what I came to the table to see!<br/><br/>If my game is all about me being clever and surviving the dungeon, though, then having a roll take away my agency might be removing my ability to play the game, and that's going to feel like a total loss.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462613/#Comment_462613" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-28T20:14:47+00:00" title="April 28, 2017  8:14PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's "culture of play" <i>because</i> of the stance, not as an alternative to the stance.

For instance, consider a D&amp;D table which has an established culture of "the PCs work together to overcome challenges and defeat enemies". If I come to the table and my whole plan is to screw over the other characters and leave them die in the dungeon while I run off with the treasure, at some point we will probably experience some real tension or get angry at each other.<br/><br/>This doesn't require any difference in stance - just different expectations about what typical play is like.<br/><br/>The same thing goes for a game like Fiasco: when I sign up to play, I'm (likely) excited about the idea of seeing my character does some stupid stuff and get in trouble. This means that, even if I am prepared to play my character from an "immersive" stance, I'm likely to create a character or conceive a personality which will more likely do stupid stuff and get into trouble.<br/><br/>As a final example, consider a D&amp;D campaign where we try our best to preserve our characters' lives and hope to see them go on to become great heroes. However, the game is really deadly, so it's hard. We're careful! It's worth the effort. Another group, using the same rules and the same GM prep and approach, really celebrates seeing characters try high-risk stunts, wander into dungeons beyond their abilities, and die in glorious ways. If you have a character who lives through it, it's a gamble won, not a game carefully played. Watching the majority of them snuff it is part of the fun!<br/><br/>Finally, we have a third D&amp;D campaign which is very similar, but where the GM constantly cheats, fudges, or otherwise contrives to allow the PCs to survive. The players might approach the game the same way (in terms of stance), but sooner or later their actions and choices are going to start to look quite different.<br/><br/>All these things affect how we play and what we're likely to reject or embrace.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462641">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462641/#Comment_462641" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-29T04:50:49+00:00" title="April 29, 2017  4:50AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, your three D&amp;D campaigns seem completely unrelated to an NPC making a successful Fast-Talk or Persuasion roll against a PC.<br/><br/>You've listed three (out of many thousands) cases where "culture of play" does other work than stance enabling and/or stance transition enabling.<br/><br/>To clarify, "culture of play" affects play in many ways.

One can probably find play cultures which handle this seamlessly, but the dissonance Sandra described sounds much more natural and common to me.  I wouldn't call this dissonance a "play culture issue" if it takes an extreme outlier culture to handle it.  I think there's something inherent to the procedure that deserves recognition.  Maybe stance-shifting covers that well... I'm not sure, but I think it's an interesting angle to take.<br/><br/>I mean, if I know before the scene even begins that the NPC might persuade me on the right die roll, and I keep that in mind while I roleplay, and make sure to leave that option plausibly open, then yeah, the play culture at my table enables the die to hit the table and me to receive the result without much dissonance.

Sorry if that sounds like a cop out.<br/>I don't really see how the roll helps. If the player wants to pretend they don't know the meta-information, they can; why would they need to roll for it?<br/><br/>I've had players in my 5e who got into a TPK then went straight into the same trap again and died again "because our characters wouldn't know that it was dangerous". And they're right, it's an interesting dilemma. Adam Cadre has made a few games about this theme: Endless, Nameless, and Shrapnel, and to a lesser extent Lock &amp; Key.<br/><br/>Stepping back a bit: Obviously there are players who enjoy it when their character gets persuaded by a roll, and some who are jarred by it. That's because of stance, I'd argue. But at some point that just becomes semantics.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I also apologize if I'm stepping on your toes; I can't quite keep up with this pace of conversation, and I feel like I'm constantly misreading or missing context.
