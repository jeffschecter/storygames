I'm posting a PDF here:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?yjwdidx0g0f" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.mediafire.com/?yjwdidx0g0f</a><br/><br/>Please note this is a work in progress, and may be (very) rough around (multiple) edges.<br/><br/>I've play tested this a handful of times with some young people, and it seems to work. My questions, specific and otherwise, are:<br/><br/>A) Does the darkside death spiral mechanic seem workable? Should I explain what I mean by "darkside death spiral"?<br/><img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> Are there obvious holes, situations pertinent to a chivalric milieu (can I use that term even though EGG is dead?) with a Black Knight slide?<br/>C) Is the game too preachy?<br/>D) Is it more or less sufficient as written, other than those parts left blank? I mean, *I* can play it, but hell, I wrote it; that's hardly a fair test.<br/>E) Do you like it?<br/><br/>With respect to "C", my goal is to give players (who may be, but are not necessarily, young players) opportunities to sell out or rationalize "wicked" deeds, only to find that ultimately it costs them the character. See what I mean about preachy?<br/><br/>OK, bring it!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142453">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142453/#Comment_142453" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-05T11:51:58+00:00" title="May  5, 2008 11:51AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            a) From what I'm reading it doesn't actually look like a death spiral to me. Sure some people might go to the darkside, but there's nothing there to cause it to happen, as long as a player is willing to fail. I presume the GM's role is then to create situations where players want to succeed desperately enough that they are willing to stake their honour, but even with that there's nothing to force players to become black knights. Also, since it's an all or nothing deal, there's nothing to stop someone from stopping once they've started. One right side up shield with the rest being upside down is the same as all right side up with no upside down shields.<br/><br/>c) Not as far as I can tell, but that may be because I'm reading it as some things are more important than honour, and then the trick is figuring out what those things are.<br/><br/>d) There are references to things that are never followed up on (the round table and the bonus die that a black knight gets and how to play any character other than a knight (the game suggests you can but I don't really see any rules to support that)) and there seems to be a part missing about what it is you do. Like, do you go on missions? Are the characters supposed to have goals that they pursue? Also, I don't sufficiently understand risking honour. Like, I get how it works mechanically, but I don't feel I have a grasp of how it gets done at the table, like what do the players say? And finally, why do you risk your honour before you roll? Why not after you roll (and fail)?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_142821">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hieronymous" title="hieronymous"><img alt="hieronymous" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://malcontent.sourdust.com/img/th_coverreve200.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hieronymous">hieronymous</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142821/#Comment_142821" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-07T07:48:37+00:00" title="May  7, 2008  7:48AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Christopher,<br/><br/>Thanks for taking the time to look it over and give me feedback.<br/><br/>a) You're absolutely right, it's not a death spiral. It could be made one, though, albeit a voluntary one, if, for example, your first and second Honor were worth 1 die, your second and third worth 2, etc.--or some variation on that that offers a sizable but not overwhelming advantage. A 1 die increase per shield may be too much, for example. And you raise a very good point, that other than "burning" shields, there's no mechanical penalty for having upside down shields, until the last one, of course. And really, who's going to burn that one? Yes, the GM is in charge of nudging players down the slope, but ideally the mechanic would tempt players to start staking Honor, then beyond 2-3 shields would make it almost impossible to stop. And something needs to account for the Last Shield. I'll ponder that.<br/><br/>d) I admit the draft I posted is incomplete. The round table is really important, obviously, and probably what I will tackle next. As for activities, missions is probably not the right word for what I have in mind. The Arthurian stuff is just, well, weird, in a non-sensical, dreamlike way. That's another aspect I need to work into a mechanic. Could be as dumb as a menu (or table) of story starters. <br/><br/>I thought staking Honor was at least sketched out in the example, but obviously I need to make that stronger too. And yeah, and alternate mechanic might be to allow staking Honor as a re-roll on a botched action, though i don't see that as necessary; a player can pretty much tell if they face unlikely odds and need to bring in Honor even before they roll.<br/><br/>Thanks again for your comments, they're very helpful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142824/#Comment_142824" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-07T07:57:32+00:00" title="May  7, 2008  7:57AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: hieronymous</cite>As for activities, missions is probably not the right word for what I have in mind.

Everything I learned about King Arthur is from the cartoon (watched about twenty years ago), Rifts (read about eight years ago), and Monty Python (watched about fifteen years ago). So I get the impression that the document presumes I'll know something about King Arthur, when really I don't. And maybe that's because the target audience is people who know about King Arthur.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
