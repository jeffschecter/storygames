There's a pretty good argument to be made that gaming is just a continuum, meaning these games are like a conversation that build off what has come before. I'd argue that there are some games I've seen that don't have any sort of concrete antecedents. Microscope for example. I know there are similar concepts, but the execution of Microscope is one of the smoothest set of rules and play I've encountered and I can't really say I've ever played anything else like it. And the game even seems to be Internet ready in the ease with which it can be played online with little adjustment.<br/><br/>So who or what do you see as a signpost of the future of gaming and where we are going next?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400238">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zelbinian" title="Zelbinian"><img alt="Zelbinian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/056/nMYJBWP65457Z.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zelbinian">Zelbinian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400238/#Comment_400238" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-09T18:14:11+00:00" title="December  9, 2012  6:14PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The raw hack-ability/adaptability of Apocalypse World makes me want to throw this into the ring.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/huckabees" title="huckabees"><img alt="huckabees" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/huckabees">huckabees</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400239/#Comment_400239" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-09T18:16:51+00:00" title="December  9, 2012  6:16PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't gotten a chance to play AW but just read it and I have to agree.

I'm not nearly as well-versed in gaming or story-gaming as most of you, but I've yet to play a game that was so readily adaptable with it's rules  as Apocalypse World. Is your world a special little snowflake? Do the current moves not support some things that happen? Make 'em up. On the fly, even. Plenty of other games let you do stuff like this, but usually it takes a fair amount of work. So I guess what I'm saying is, I think the utility of on-the-fly adaptability is pretty well demonstrated by *World games, but they way in which they do it is only one possibility. There's a lot of room to explore there. So I think it's a decent candidate for a place where game designers decide to spend their time in the near future as they try to push the boundaries of what we think of as RPGs. Of course, that's probably wishful thinking. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400293/#Comment_400293" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-10T03:33:09+00:00" title="December 10, 2012  3:33AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 10, 2012 3:33AM by Rickard.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Structures on how to play, and more importantly, and on how to encourage a creative environment is probably something that will occur more in games (or so I hope). Techniques put in structures like "The first act is always about ... " or in game rules like "If your character isn't in the scene during a conflict, you may cheer on another person by sending a die that way" (to support a technique to create "active listening").<br/><br/>The thing is why Apocalypse World is so easy to use in other games is that the rules are more techniques than actual game mechanics. Face it, it's just traditional play described in a pedagogic way. It's weird to say that this is the melody of the future, because Robin D Laws has done this for twenty years, but I think people (game designers) are more aware about this and have now different sources to draw structures from.<br/><br/>Play Unsafe: the RPG isn't something that's totally impossible.

I have been reading 24 Game Poems and the Norwegian Style anthology (bought from Lulu) and its such a different experience than anything that''s labeled as traditional roleplay. They're like little philosophical moments. I'm sure nothing like them would ever replace the traditional game, but they do feel like a big expansion of the genre, sort of an analog to the whole concept people have of comic books being purely superhero fare.

There may be some light continuity elements, but they will be optional.  RPGs will become more specialized in their topic, setting and presentation, approaching the Pelgrane Press mission statement of games that can be taught to and understood by a group of adults in fifteen minutes or less, and played in under three hours.<br/><br/>In short, game design will be informed by the logistics of getting people together to play as much as (if not more than) anything else.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400334">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard" title="AMBayard"><img alt="AMBayard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard">AMBayard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400334/#Comment_400334" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-10T09:08:30+00:00" title="December 10, 2012  9:08AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like AW.

Usually, a good indication of the immediate future is the thing that people are gathered all around. Pick your favorite social science, they'll all predict more-or-less the same thing. *W games are the new hotness right now (btw, I hate lumping them together like that because, besides the move mechanics and the MC advice, they're not very much alike; I love AW, am meh about DW, and would likely never buy Monsterhearts). This makes it rather likely that, in the near future, the engine's influence will be felt in a lot of games. In the not-so-immediate future? The safe bet is the pendulum swinging AWAY from the current hotness. What this breeds is hard to say. It could be the embracing of the past (hey, it happens), or it could be pushing new boundaries, like The Quiet Year is doing right now.<br/><br/>That said, probably none of that will happen. I don't actually have a way to read the preferences of indie/storygamers as a whole so... a lot of that analysis likely rests on flawed assumptions. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I am definitely looking forward to more awesome indie games as the years go by!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400351">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander" title="Rob_Alexander"><img alt="Rob_Alexander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/638/nM7WEDAVEW1RY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander">Rob_Alexander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400351/#Comment_400351" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-10T11:10:15+00:00" title="December 10, 2012 11:10AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>There's a pretty good argument to be made that gaming is just a continuum, meaning these games are like a conversation that build off what has come before.</blockquote>\nI'd agree that they're building on one another, and we're seeing greater diversity over time (that's typical of evolved systems).

After DM-ing in 4e I felt like the players just reacted to my story. I haven't gotten a chance to play AW yet but I get the feeling the GM becomes the facilitator, not the director. It's a strong parallel to the new philosophy of education I see in my workplace, the teacher doesn't stand in front and put knowledge into the brains of the students. Instead, they propose ideas, ask questions, make critiques, etc. The goal is to get the student thinking, keep them on their toes and engaged. It's the whole "Yes and..." idea from improv. <br/><br/>What I love about the future of these games is the anticipation of the variety that is to come. Already there are so many games that challenge notions of storytelling, character, mechanics. I get a total nerd rush when I encounter a game system that makes me think in a different way. I also think the Internet really is the future of these games moreso than any game system or mechanic. This board alone has allowed me to discover hundreds of new games (and spend way too much money).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400372">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander" title="Rob_Alexander"><img alt="Rob_Alexander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/638/nM7WEDAVEW1RY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander">Rob_Alexander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400372/#Comment_400372" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-10T14:16:21+00:00" title="December 10, 2012  2:16PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>However, I think the more interesting future explorations are in finding where AW (and other systems)  break down \u2014 what kinds of stories is the system bad at telling?

I think there is still a lot to discover about how rule systems can encouraging boundary pushing social and emotional conflict in Role-playing games. This may even include more games that include a greater degree of player vs player conflict.

I see games with simple rules and procedures that run quite well without a narrative genius with amazing social skills that knows the rulebook like the palm of his hand, but highly benefits from having such a person facilitating the game and introducing interesting content. I see games that start with a few rules and commplicate over time when the players are ready for it, instead of stuffing them up from the start with things they won't use yet. I see decks that facilitate and dosificate the use of mechanics and procedures, that may even switch the game focus and create a different experience with the same tools. I see games that grow with player input, not only in content but in mechanics to achieve an specific atmosphere and a variety of effects. I see procedures that make play more interactive, so players have something to do even when it isn't their turn.<br/><br/>It seems future promises a lot of fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400447">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/huckabees" title="huckabees"><img alt="huckabees" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/huckabees">huckabees</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400447/#Comment_400447" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-11T07:18:28+00:00" title="December 11, 2012  7:18AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was just reading <a href="http://www.photographsoflightning.com/" rel="nofollow">Jackson Tegu's website and blog</a> and thinking THIS is the future of gaming.

For anyone that's a movie geek, we know that the tropes of film have been interpreted in a very different way outside of the U.S. Think about French New Wave and Japanese auteurs (Ozu, Kurosawa). They are part of the larger conversation of film, but direct the conversation onto different aspects, while feeding back into the larger one. I'm excited to see how cultural experiences outside my own interpret the tropes of gaming. I love to read over what places like <a href="http://www.miserytourism.com/" rel="nofollow">Misery Tourism</a> are doing, just because it's so unlike what "roleplaying games" are defined as and it seems to challenge the idea that game are something that you should derive escapist enjoyment from. <br/><br/>Its the argument I have with my friends who only want to see Michael Bay-esque blow 'em ups or twee cutesy Wes Anderson fare. I get why people enjoy those repetitious film concepts, but some times I want to watch a documentary that gets me angry and doesn't leave me feeling good. Some times I want to be made to think. And my hope is to see a little niche for games that do the same thing, challenge my precepts about politics, religion, etc. and make me think for a long time. A game like Durance makes me seriously think about hierarchical structures in societies and the ability or inability of the citizens to move on these ladders. But then some times I want to just dungeon crawl and loot. I love that there's that amazing variety for me to pick from.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/olepeder" title="olepeder"><img alt="olepeder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/olepeder">olepeder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400456/#Comment_400456" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-11T07:39:43+00:00" title="December 11, 2012  7:39AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wish you could give thumbs up or plusses to posts here! :)Lot's of groovy thoughts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400517">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400517/#Comment_400517" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-11T18:23:19+00:00" title="December 11, 2012  6:23PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>This may even include more games that include a greater degree of player vs player conflict.</blockquote>\nI think a big thing going forward will be continuing to focus on emotional conflict between players. Smallville, Monsterhearts, Fiasco, Hillfolk/Dramasystem, and a few other games have started to do this well, and I think that making this approach more common and mainstream will be a big part of the near future. Teaching players how to fight "to the pain" rather than "to the death" as they fight amongst themselves will be a huge part of what the next decade of games will continue to tackle.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400522/#Comment_400522" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-11T19:20:23+00:00" title="December 11, 2012  7:20PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The most important designers for the future haven't published any games yet.

I want to see RPGs that are partly electronic, that go hog wild using board game components, that deal with totally different subject matter, and so on. How much those can come to fruition I think is going to depend a lot on costs, but stuff like POD has kept getting better and cheaper. The Game Crafter (which figures heavily into my current project) is still a bit pricey to use, but the quality and variety of things they can make has just kept getting better with time, and OBS is starting up a DriveThruCards.com site next month as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell" title="John_Powell"><img alt="John_Powell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/nP846SDWNCDOK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell">John_Powell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400575/#Comment_400575" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-12T09:56:41+00:00" title="December 12, 2012  9:56AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's a rpg that's partly electronic:<br/><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1858774754/magicians-a-language-learning-rpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1858774754/magicians-a-language-learning-rpg</a><br/><br/>Conflict resolution is determined by how well a speech recognition app understands your attempt to speak in a foreign language.

They take those very oldschool aspects, and drag them really kicking and screamign through the hedge of modern design, keep their best bits in the process. The storygaming movement is really fascinating, and I feel like it has almost grown to be its own seperate child thing, to an extent, such that it and trad games can copulate and produce horrifying but pretty mutant offspring (Honestly, I think a lot of the *World games fit in this category too, taking a lot of traditional RPG concept lines, and really then running with a focus on relationships of the characters to the world and eachother).<br/>I must admit, from a traditional viewpoint, I am always fascinated by what Rob Heinsoo does, and I think a lot of his design work is (Although some people may not like it) quite different, whilst still operating within the folds of what might be considered traditional, and this is important, as it'll lead more people through from only playing trad or indie games to playing both. Variety is good~                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
