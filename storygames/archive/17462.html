I really appreciate what Sage/Adam have tried to do with regard to removing the DnD power creep treadmill but have they gone too far with starting character HP? 20+HP at level 1 when a goblin does 1d6 damage... kinda hard to feel the threat?   <br/><br/>Anyway I wasn't the only one muttering this at the weekend, what do others think?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395444">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395444/#Comment_395444" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-30T15:22:52+00:00" title="October 30, 2012  3:22PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You can always use the HP amounts in World of Dungeons if you want something that feels more old school and randomly deadly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395448">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395448/#Comment_395448" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-30T15:41:15+00:00" title="October 30, 2012  3:41PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I struggle a bit with this too, but I think it's us as GMs, not the game.

One thing you may have assumed is that the Deal Damage move only occurs to the PC who just missed their roll. Maybe, maybe not.<br/><br/>It's been established in the fiction that there are a couple of murderous ghosts all over the Wizard. He misses and gets hit with clammy heart-freezing damage (2d8 piercing, take highest).  You've been talking to the wizard for a awhile so maybe you cut to thief who's got a ghost in his grill. The thief misses. In some situations I might make a different call but in this one, (and often) not only is the thief getting hit for 1d8 piercing, but the the Wizard's getting hit again for 2d8 highest too (good thing for him the bear-form druid is defending him...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395489">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395489/#Comment_395489" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-30T18:33:35+00:00" title="October 30, 2012  6:33PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My son died twice in a row the 2 times he played.

The current HP system is there to allow PCs a couple of mistakes without being dead, but still make death always an option.<br/><br/>The thing to remember (as someone pointed out) is that damage follows the fiction. If something happens that would hurt a PC <i>tell them what damage they take.</i> That often follows from a soft move that was ignored, something like "the goblin archers that you didn't deal with take their shots as you slay their kin\u2026"<br/><br/>The first fight for new PCs they likely have an advantage\u2014they're pretty well equipped. But after the thief's leather armor is ripped to shreds, the fighter's shield gets mangled by a trap, and the cleric has Cure Light Wounds revoked, well, trouble happens.<br/><br/>The chance of player death is also balanced against how long it takes to make a character. It's not quite as easy to make a new DW character as it is to make a new Dungeon Crawl Classics character, for example, so DW characters are a little more survivable. That's not to mean they're invulnerable, just that it takes a little more to kill one. That may not be the most old school approach, but it's an approach we've had a lot of fun with and seen a lot of other people enjoy.<br/><br/>That said, Adam and I aren't infalible. We have a lot of confidence in the numbers as stated but you may want to adjust them some\u2014that's completely cool! There's certainly some taste involved. If you're a GM who's ready to dish out damage and your players are ready to take it then try one of these:<br/><br/>Instead of using your class's base HP, during character creation roll your class's damage die and add CON. That's your Maximum HP. If your Constitution improves you can roll again and take the better result.<br/><br/>Instead of using your class's base HP, during character creation roll your class's damage die. Compare the result to CON. The higher number becomes your Maximum HP. If your Constitution improves you can roll again and take the better result.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Either one of those will put you into Moldvay-ish levels and make every goblin a threat to the wizard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395642/#Comment_395642" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-31T18:06:29+00:00" title="October 31, 2012  6:06PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The other thing that I forgot to mention: DW is a very easy game to scale up the challenge in, because the "challenge" is pretty directly related to the fiction. You don't have XP guidelines or encounter budgets. If your players can take on 5 goblins (a number I pulled out of my head) what about when those goblins have magic? Or what about 5 orcs?

I find this oddly jarring in a game full of invokable story cues like conditions, tags and move choices. So I use physical counters to rectify this, the players each have a bunch of heart shaped red glass tokens. I tell them that once their last token is gone, their heart stops and they have to face death's dark gates. I also give out conditions all the time, prescriptively following the narrative description. I mean debilities are the obvious choice here. But I use others as the situation deems suitable. The players write the tag down on a post-it and stick it to the top of their character sheet.<br/><br/>Cleric fails his prayer roll to turn undead? Well, I could have the zombies gnaw into him or his friend's HP, but I would probably say they are <b><i>terrified</i></b>!

And y'know what? It doesn't really matter to me. It doesn't stick out in my GM memory of our sessions as an issue. For a long time In the beginning when there was a lot of level escalation, I simply used the AW countdown clocks instead. I guess that's because my 'style' is to be a fan of the characters, and also be truthful to the fiction. So in that sense, 'HP' to me are simply a capricious way of gauging 'damage'; a tool in the service of following the principles and agenda and thus incorporated where required in making moves (hard or soft). I like applied tags / conditions far more, and monster moves even more than that!<br/><br/>I think for a long while the starting HP was equal to a class\u2019s base HP+Con. Minimum starting HP is 4. So a fighter was +7, Cleric +5 etc.<br/><br/>When you leveled there was a HP 'Move':\n<blockquote>Then roll+Con to determine HP. On a 10+, you get class+Con+2 HP, add that to your current and total HP. On a 7-9, you get class+1+Con HP instead. On a 6-, you get class+Con HP but don\u2019t suffer any consequences.</blockquote>\nIt worked OK, and it was kinda cool for the players to increase in HP when they leveled up, but those days of yore when the monsters had levels, the harm move was in play and the critters dealt set damage. To compensate, I simply adjusted that damage amount dealt to prescriptively to <b>fill their lives with adventure</b>.  Once it was authored in, it stuck. But really, that was boring. Even with the narrative descriptive accompaniment. So now I go to town with the moves, I mean, they are my GM's little playbook after all.<br/><br/>Ho Hum, the brave (read: unconditionally stupid, despite numerous signs of impeding doom) fighter wades into battle  with the horde of Sahuagin and on a 7-9 the feisty amphibians get to make an attack. I could get to roll a whole heap of damage and choose the best of their Endless teeth (d6+4 damage, 1 piercing) and also Close, Forceful and Messy. Wicked, I get to describe them hanging all over him, biting and gnawing, teeth like needles gouging away his amour and spraying gore all over the place as he is driven to his knees! So, what do you do Mr. 'I'm all up in these fishies grills?'.<br/><br/>But even if I used the maximum damage of 10, to a fully fresh Level 1 fighter with say 25 HP? Huh, well its a blow for sure, but not at the level of  threat Paul is after.... So what if instead, I make the monster move on our hapless Fighter and <b>Bite off a limb</b> (forcefully and messily). Am I being a dick? I could even apply the damage <b><i>and</i></b> bite off a limb as Mr. Harper elegantly reminds us. I think that's pretty damn threatening to any character, level one or no, all from a 'traditionally' low level critter.<br/><br/>Heck even the lowly rat, despite dealing only minimal damage can always <b>Rip something (or someone) apart</b>...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396348">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396348/#Comment_396348" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-05T08:40:51+00:00" title="November  5, 2012  8:40AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Noofy,<br/><br/>Awesome answer.

Con is the modifier (-1 to +2 for starting characters); constitution is the ability score. <br/><br/>Over time we've tried several approaches. The ones that we went the furthest with were low base + Con (so something like 4+Con for the wizard) with scaling by level; or the current med base + Constitution without scaling. We found the not-scaling made a better game, for the type of game we were going for.<br/><br/>I'm actually a little ashamed that, until this thread, I had never thought of using damage dice to set HP. I actually think there's a lot of potential there, but DW is essentially a finished game\u2014we're not going to try that change now.<br/><br/>Another thing to consider, when comparing DW HP and D&amp;D (any edition) HP is that D&amp;D HP takes into account miss chance. So a d6 damage goblin vs a 4 HP wizard will still only get hit maybe 50% of the time, so roughly two rolls per hit, and two hits to kill, so four goblin attacks to kill a wizard. The DW wizard has 4+Constitution HP, so considerably more\u2014let's say 13 HP, which assumes a wizard with constitution as his second lowest score. He also has 1 armor (most likely) so it takes being dealt goblin damage about 5 times to kill him on average. That's slightly higher, yes, but not hugely different.<br/><br/>And, as John points out, that damage is following form the fiction, so there's lots of other badness likely to come along with it\u2014broken things, lost weapons, people in spots, poison, debilities, etc.<br/><br/>This isn't to say we're exactly the same as D&amp;D (which of course has changed over editions), just that we're in the same neighborhood.

Like the goblin warrens in The Bloodstone idol: the sheer number of goblins makes that more like an environment effect, not a large number to fight.<br/><br/>Anyway, the current rule is:<br/><br/>When you take damage from multiple monsters at once, take the highest damage amongst all the monsters, roll it for each monster, and take the highest result.<br/><br/>The problem there is that it doesn't quite scale the way we want it to. Goblins are a good example: by the time you have more than a few you're just going to get 6 damage each time, which isn't quite what we want.<br/><br/>So we're adding some amount of additional damage per monster. This makes it so goblins scale up a bit more. Our design goal has been that one goblin is dangerous, but a few at the same time is likely death for an unprepared wizard. This change will bring us in line with that.<br/><br/>Here's the changes we're considering:<br/><br/>+1 damage per monster beyond the first.<br/><br/>For each monster beyond the first, add damage equal to half the size of their damage die: +2 for a d4, +3 for a d6, +4 for a d8, +5 for a d10, etc.<br/><br/>For each monster beyond the first, add damage based on their organization: +2 for each horde monster and +4 for each group monster. For each solitary monster, roll it's entire damage and add it to the total.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396635">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396635/#Comment_396635" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-06T17:03:07+00:00" title="November  6, 2012  5:03PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whooboy, those are all too much, IMO.<br/><br/>I'd say like maybe the last one, but make it the best die AND +1 for every two horde monsters or +2-3 for each group monster.

The difference between 1 goblin and 8 in that scenario is pretty tiny. In the fiction, the difference between 1 goblin and 8 matters -- you're getting swarmed. A couple of extra HP damage isn't enough.</blockquote>\nI don't think the difference is as small as you're assuming.<br/><br/>1 Goblin = d6 damage for, say 1 or 2 hits until you kill it. So a total of about 5 damage on average. A speed bump. But maybe just enough to make you want to do something about it, if it got lucky in it's hits.<br/><br/>8 Goblins = Approximately 7 damage per turn (decreasing as you whittle them down) until you take them out. Let's say you double up some attacks with some creative fictional positioning and you take them out in 3 rounds of 7-9 rolls. Call that 18 damage average. That's a strong risk of a kill for any starting non-tank character.<br/><br/>Remember - it's not just that it's a couple more HP per hit. It takes more rounds to deal with a bigger group.<br/><br/>And then, of course, there's the Goblin's instinct and special moves.<br/><br/>Instinct: To multiply<br/>\u2022Charge!<br/>\u2022Call more goblins<br/>\u2022Retreat and return with (many) more<br/><br/>So 1 goblin is rarely 1 goblin for long anyway. And 8 rarely stays just 8.<br/><br/>I really like the "add +1 for every roll that matches the top roll" idea. It's easy to implement. And I REALLY like the way it boosts the d4 and d6 monsters in an obvious and intuitive way.<br/><br/>I like the way that Dungeon World lets you fight groups of monsters with risk that increases only slightly rather than exponentially. It makes the game feel like badass heroic fantasy without using godawful numbers inflation to do it.<br/><br/>Plus, as GM, when a player is getting swarmed, there's plenty you can do with fictional positioning to make it hurt. There's no need to add tons of extra damage to that.<br/><br/>Also, remember that armor works on damage reduction. Therefore, each +1 damage per strike also means that it's going through your armor better. If you have 2 points of armor, the difference between a hit of 6 hits at 4 damage each and 4 hits at 6 damage each is significant.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396705/#Comment_396705" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-07T09:53:49+00:00" title="November  7, 2012  9:53AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Our current candidate wording:<br/><br/><i>When multiple creatures attack at once, start by determining who's leading the attack\u2014if it's an uncoordinated mob, just choose a leader at random.

After 4 goblins more don't really help. A group of goblins still has the same min and max as one goblin, which seems odd\u2014wouldn't being stabbed by 4 guys have a potential for more harm than just one?<br/><br/>New way (+half die size):<br/>1 goblin: 3.5 mean damage (1.7 dev)<br/>2 goblins: 6.5 mean damage (1.7 dev)<br/>3 goblins: 9.5 mean damage (1.7 dev)<br/>4 goblins: 12.5 mean damage (1.7 dev)<br/>5 goblins: 15.5 mean damage (1.7 dev)<br/><br/>This has a lot of characteristics we like:<br/>-Monsters in groups get more dangerous the larger the group<br/>-What monsters are in the group matters some, but not too hugely<br/>-It's pretty easy to explain<br/>-Only one roll required<br/>-An undefended wizard should worry if he's surrounded by goblins<br/><br/>Simplifying to "+2 per each additional monster" loses the distinction of how dangerous each additional monster is, but is super simple and matches our intentions around monster lethality.<br/><br/>A whole set of fictional outcomes could be cool, but it adds way more complexity than we'd like. Plus, we only want to make small targeted changes at this point. We're not looking to rethink much here, just tweak some math.<br/><br/>Increasing damage die size works to a point, but the chance for only 1 damage might be weird.

That makes it so that character powers that increase your damage help you defeat both big solos and small horde critters in a way that is more math-consistent.<br/><br/>I think these group escalation rules make the game more dependent on the number of PCs playing. If you have less than a party of 4 working together, the math turns against you MUCH faster. Which is realistic.

What weapon is being used? Who's swinging it?<br/><br/>Yes, that might lead to multiple goblins being hurt, sure.<br/><br/>You can hit as many at a time as the fiction dictates. If you line up several oozes in a row and fire an arrow straight through all of them (and we assume oozes are pretty much water balloons) sure, you can damage all of them.<br/><br/>Being able to divide your damage only weakens your ability to deal with multiple monsters. You still have to be in a situation where you could harm all of them, but now each one only takes some of your damage.<br/><br/>Facing more monsters has always been dangerous, especially when the monsters greatly out number you. Remember, these damage rules only come into play when multiple monsters actually strike together, they don't get bonus damage just for hanging out. We're just fine-tuning the dangerousness.<br/><br/>The original rule was that all monsters did their damage, but that escalated too fast.<br/><br/>Very late in the game we changed to roll and take best, but that escalates very slowly. Practically, the monsters that are most likely to fight in groups (d6 damage hordes) get the smallest benefit from it\u2014past about 3 they get very little per addition attacker. Those swarming goblins are actually being stupid: they should split up. We want goblins to swarm! Goblins swarm for a reason!<br/><br/>So what we want is something that escalates between take-best and roll-all. Right now we're leaning towards escalate-and-add-1, as that hits a nice middle ground, benefits small monsters the most, and doesn't require a lot of rolls.<br/><br/>I don't quite see how this hurts small groups. A party of 3 PCs who get mobbed by 9 goblins is approximately as overwhelmed as a party of 4 PCs who get mobbed by 12 goblins.<br/><br/>The reason I prefer to have more monsters be clearly A Bad Thing for the PCs is that it allows the GM to easily tune things based on the fiction. Monsters that work together are clearly dangerous, so if you want an easier Dungeon World your monsters don't work together much. Your goblins bicker and even backstab each other, your orcs rage instead of coordinating their attacks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396722">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396722/#Comment_396722" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-07T12:13:29+00:00" title="November  7, 2012 12:13PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm happy that this discussion is taking place publicly so that people can see different options and weigh them out.<br/><br/>I'll probably use "Roll a die for each, take the highest, add +1 for each roll that matches the highest." It sounds like the most fun to me. It lets you have the fun of rolling a handful of dice, but only on rare occasions. So it emphasized that all those dice represent a bunch of nasties swarming you. But it's fast and low-math to get the result.<br/><br/>And, most importantly, it only escalates the damage a little. Which I like. I'd rather encourage fights versus hordes rather than discourage them.<br/><br/>I think escalating the damage to the point where nobody can take more than 2 or maybe 3 hits is less awesome. Staying closer to the 4-6 hits before dropping range is the sweet spot for me.<br/><br/>My son is already in danger of finding the game unfun. He died in each of his first 2 sessions of Living Dungeon World at the last Strategicon. The fact that he's still interested in the game shows excellent sportsmanship for a 10 year old. And being 10, he's less good at this point at seeing ways to maximize his effectiveness through fictional positioning. So large encounters are already going to be extra dangerous for him because he doesn't quite get how to make up awesome but reasonable ways for how to hurt several baddies at a time.<br/><br/>I'm just saying, if you're going to escalate the damage that groups of monsters can do, you might want to think about putting more than one little sentence in that tells you how to hurt more than one monster at a time. Because if anyone misses how to do that, these rules are going to make a big group of bad guys super deadly.<br/><br/>Maybe a small heading section on multiple monsters that mentions how to deal with them from both directions - how they hurt players more and how players hurt more of them.

Statistically, it's a hair less - a d6 averages 3.5 instead of 3. But at the end of the day, it's basically saying all the monsters do all their damage as one attack, minus a couple of HP.<br/><br/>So that solution gets you basically right back to where you were originally, just with less swing. 6 goblins (d6 damage) do 18.5 damage with less variance instead of 21 damage with more variance. Either way, it means that nobody can take that damage more than once.<br/><br/>And goblins are supposed to show up in hordes, not groups. So being outnumbered 5-1 or 6-1 should be common against them, right?<br/><br/>I think something that look more like a logarithmic curve is essential if you're going to pit a horde against a party.<br/><br/>Because d6 damage is always a threat if you face it several times in a row, due to the low HP cap in DW. You don't have to increase that damage much for it to because a really big threat really fast.<br/><br/>In the Living Dungeon World sessions I played, the GM almost never used increased damage dice. Basically everything we faced was d6 damage at a time. And we still had at least one death every session. (Partly my fault - I didn't make use of my Paladin's healing ability enough - though it's a risky one).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396732">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/silby" title="silby"><img alt="silby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/silby">silby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396732/#Comment_396732" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-07T13:11:22+00:00" title="November  7, 2012  1:11PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Or even, monster descriptions:<br/><br/>Goblins: Damage<br/>One - d6<br/>A couple - d8+1<br/>A small group - 2d6+1<br/>A horde - 2d8+1<br/>...<br/><br/>Or perhaps:<br/><br/>Monster damage<br/>One - roll as usual (1d6)<br/>A couple - roll twice, take highest (2d6, keep highest)<br/>A small group - double damage (2d6)<br/>A horde - triple damage (3d6)<br/><br/>Stop there.

Goblins are best off fighting about 4-to-1, but more than that still helps. A very powerful monster, say a vampire, doesn't get as much from help, but still gets something.<br/><br/>The damage bonus is noticeable but not huge. Remember, a fighter gets +1d6 damage on a 10+ (if they choose to exchange hits), and moves that give bonus damage typically give about +1d4\u2013+1d6, so we consider that a pretty typical bonus damage range. This puts the most fictionally applicable situations (2-4 goblins, giant rats, whatever, surrounding a PC) in that same realm.<br/><br/>It's simple and only requires one roll.<br/><br/>It's obvious what's going on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396746">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396746/#Comment_396746" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-07T14:10:42+00:00" title="November  7, 2012  2:10PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's impossible that "roll and take best" gets you more than "roll, take best, add +1 for numbers matching the best".<br/><br/>You did the math wrong.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396747">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396747/#Comment_396747" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-07T14:16:26+00:00" title="November  7, 2012  2:16PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>It's impossible that "roll and take best" gets you more than "roll, take best, add +1 for numbers matching the best".<br/><br/>You did the math wrong.</blockquote>\nYup, I did!

I think that's good design. <br/><br/>For one, because the bigger monsters are already more dangerous because they typically deliver their damage more times (and bigger groups typically do likewise). <br/><br/>For two, because the HP range for PCs is pretty small, you don't need to increase damage much to increase the threat a lot. <br/><br/>And for three, because when you're being lead by the fiction, a big enough mob of big enough creatures is no longer Hack And Slash - instead it's Morpheus being mobbed by the cops in The Matrix - they just overwhelm him and win once the ratio gets big enough that he can't maneuver around them enough anymore. At that point, you just transition to the scene where the goblins have captured the guy and trussed him up and are about to put him on a barbecue.<br/><br/>If I'm reading it right, nobody has more than 30 HP, right? And only high level fighters can have more than 3 armor, right? So most characters can only take 10+ damage twice, and many can't take that. I don't see a reason to put anything's base average damage (including a group of things) at more than 7ish. Once you go past that, things get super deadly super fast.<br/><br/>I like the straight +1 per helper. For me, that hits the sweet spot nicely.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396773">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396773/#Comment_396773" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-07T16:01:50+00:00" title="November  7, 2012  4:01PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hear you Rob, and I'm really torn on this.<br/><br/>Part of why I'm leaning towards die-size-and-+1 is that it gives the GM all the tools to adjust with. If you play are you're like "oh man, too deadly" it's a bit easier to see that and say "okay, let's modify this, I'll just drop the die size increase." If, on the other hand, we have one by default and the other as an option, it's less likely that the GM will find/remember the way to increase group damage.<br/><br/>I also think that fundamentally Adam and I are aiming a bit deadlier than you're wanting, which is a tough thing to reconcile. In our vision deadly should happen with certain things: multiple monsters ganging up (not just in the same area, but actually attacking together), monsters that are strong enough to fight on their own, the PCs putting themselves into danger. We're considering "four goblins at once" as kind of a worst case, where the players have gotten in over their heads, and we <i>want</i> that to border on deadly. <br/><br/>Also, as noted, the fiction comes first. In my experience most monsters, based on the fiction, don't get more than four or so together to attack at once. The limits of space and countering effect of player tactics tend to insure that\u2014what would six goblins attacking at once really look like? The one clear answer is "six goblin archers unloading at one target at once" but that situation already sounds like some bad stuff is happening (how did you end up someplace where six archers all have a clear shot?) and it seems likely to trigger defy danger along the way.<br/><br/>All that said, we're going to continue talking this over as the index is built and the last piece of art is finished. We'd love to hear more from everyone in this thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396774">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396774/#Comment_396774" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-07T16:08:22+00:00" title="November  7, 2012  4:08PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the math involved in the change you're proposing. It's not super elegant, though, and I think some people will have trouble handling it. (You have to remember that the changes are cumulative, which is potentially difficult: let's say you've got a monster that does d6+2 damage. Add one enemy and you get d8+3, but add two more and you have d12+5. But if you're suddenly adding four enemies, you have to go step by step to figure out that it gets you from d6+2 to d12+6. For some people that could be "needs a table" territory, especially if you're feeling a little stressed or tired or whatever.)<br/><br/>It depends how user-friendly you want to be!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396779">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396779/#Comment_396779" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-07T17:01:03+00:00" title="November  7, 2012  5:01PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd honestly just go with the +1 per guy, or else the highest of their damage dice +1 for each die that matches the value.

I tend to go for the more cavalier, wade-into-groups-swinging style, so I'd read that and say "yep, sounds good to me, +1 it is!"<br/><br/>I'm pretty pleased with how much better than the original this is -- before when I was attacking people with groups of hobbits, we'd have to pass a bunch of dice around, just so they could roll the maximum.  (Kinda fun to make them roll the pool anyway, but I think the novelty woulda worn off.)<br/><br/>+2 rather than "step-up-a-die to maximum d12 and +1" should potentially come with a warning that attacking people with more than four people at once is probably two hits til they roll last breath.  <br/><br/>One thing I'd mention -- "pick the leader at random if uncoordinated" is a bit different than the previous rule of "pick the highest die type among the attackers and roll X of those, where X is the number of attackers."  <br/><br/>Currently:<br/><br/><i>When multiple creatures attack at once, start by determining who's leading the attack\u2014if it's an uncoordinated mob, just choose a leader at random. Use the leader's damage as the base for the entire attack.

Use that damage as the base for the entire attack. For each extra monster past the first, add +1 damage to the total.</i><br/><br/>(Might save a few GMs from rolling randomly to determine a leader in an uncoordinated mob when the play benefit is, in my current perception, minimal.  But, I like not rolling randomization dice while GMing, which definitely varies from person to person.)<br/><br/>Regardless, cool on publically discussing the system, really neat to see it come together, can't wait to buy it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396792">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396792/#Comment_396792" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-07T17:42:33+00:00" title="November  7, 2012  5:42PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 7, 2012 5:43PM by RobMcDiarmid.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Rob, I'd be likely to do it the other way around\u2014the rules say +2 per, marginalia or Advanced Delving chapter says "oh yeah!

IMO groups taking harm is missing in this discussion - if HP stack linearly for groups then they are much tougher (IMO they shouldn't, groups don't typically fight to the last "man"). This lack of mechanical support in DW means that it is all in the GMs hands and hence the play experience will be uneven.<br/><br/>I also think that 4 goblins as the maximum number of attackers per character under-estimates things - what about pole-arms, missiles, etc. Now where did I put my 1st ed DMG for the number of attackers based on creature size rule :-)<br/><br/>PS I had also totally missed that armour only counts once against all attacks in a round!<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/way" title="way"><img alt="way" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/way">way</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396822/#Comment_396822" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-08T02:50:11+00:00" title="November  8, 2012  2:50AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 8, 2012 2:51AM by way.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not sure if I'm late to the party, but:<br/>Group damage is best damage plus one die. d4 for one helper, d6 for two, up to the d12. <br/><br/>Adds a lot more to the thrill than the flat +2.

With +2 as a note somewhere, of course.<br/><br/>I was leaning towards +2, but the advantage of +1 that Adam pointed out is that it leaves more room for the GM to do that fictional stuff\u2014"8 damage <i>and</i> they drag you down to the floor." At +2 the damage becomes so big that it's easy for a GM to feel like anything on top of it would be overwhelming.<br/><br/>Our use case here was typical wizard (12-13 HP, 0-1 armor) against 4 or so goblins. With +1 per helper, 4 goblins will do 4-9 damage, or about 1/4-3/4 of the wizard's HP. That's a good range for us. It's unambiguously something the wizard has to respond to, since two of those are likely to be deadly, but it's also survivable (if you're not already too beat up).<br/><br/>And yes, a wizard could easily end up with a little more HP or some temporary armor, but that's <i>good.</i> That means they're playing the game. We're not trying to dictate how many hits a wizard can take, just looking at the fictional facts we're establishing.<br/><br/>The fighter (23-26 HP, 1-2 armor) can't ignore four goblins either. They'll do up to a third of the fighter's HP\u2014she can take her chances with a hit or two, but not for long.<br/><br/>Those numbers feel solid to us.<br/><br/>It also stays close to our existing math, which is good\u2014it's been well tested, and while we want to adjust it, we don't want to break it.<br/><br/>There's also a nice symmetry with armor\u2014each attacker cancels out a point of armor, basically.<br/><br/>So that's what we're thinking. We'll be distributing a PDF with this change (and the remaining edits) tomorrow, so any feedback on it today would be awesome.<br/><br/>Thanks to everyone here for having a reasoned discussion.

Fights, most obviously, but that swinging blade trap will take your HP just as surely.<br/><br/>What happens when you run out of HP, though, doesn't <i>have</i> to be death. If you want to change the <i> deadliness </i> of the game (as opposed to the pacing) the Last Breath move is the place to do it. Consider:<br/><br/>A last breath move that tracks a resource, call it Fate. You start with X Fate, when you take your last breath you can spend 1 fate to automatically succeed.<br/><br/>A last breath move that just says "You die. On a 10+ you die on your terms\u2014you have a few moments, minutes, or even days (depending on what killed you) to take care of business. On a 7-9 you die, but leave some benefit to your allies, name it."<br/><br/>A complimentary "knock out" move. When you take damage greater than Con, roll. On a 10+ you shrug it off. On a 7-9 you take -1 forward. On a miss, you're out of it for a while.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396854">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396854/#Comment_396854" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-08T11:21:16+00:00" title="November  8, 2012 11:21AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 8, 2012 11:34AM by Deliverator.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I lurve changing the death options!

To me, it maps nicely with the type of fiction I enjoy, where heroes fail much more often than they die.<br/><br/>Apparently there's a live combat larp in one of the nordic countries that does something like this. Krigslive I think it is. Apparently HP represents morale instead of health, so when you are out of points you run away and can no longer participate in the current battle. But an hour or two later when they battle again, you are good to go.<br/><br/>Not to everyone's taste. And I don't expect it to be.

You're captured, the bad guys get away, the unholy ritual reaches completion, and so on. (i.e. the MC makes a hard move). You'll be back to normal soon enough.<br/><br/>On a 7-9, choose one:<br/><br/>* You fall, unconscious, at the mercy of your enemies. Also, you'll need serious care to get back on your feet. Choose a debility.<br/>* You fall, mortally wounded. Hold 1. You may spend your hold at any time to rise again, fueled by the rage of righteousness. You go out in a blaze of glory: temporarily return to full hit points and take +1 ongoing. When your righteous rage ebbs, you lose all those temporary hit points and succumb to your wounds. Speak your last words to those around as Death takes you.<br/><br/>On a miss, you've bought it. Your soul is sent on to the Underworld. However, legend has it that Death sometimes strikes bargains with the soul of a hero who has unfinished business...<br/><br/><br/><br/>Note to the MC: In the case of the first 7-9 option, there is the unwritten agreement that "at the mercy of your enemies" means "they don't just kill you." Remember, you're a fan of the PCs.</blockquote>\n<br/>I love that meddling with the death move allows us to adjust the lethality of the game as we like without having to worry about the math. If you want to adjust hit points, fine, but you're only doing so because you like your combats to be longer or shorter. There's no longer this effect where "less lethal" is automatically coupled with "longer combats".<br/><br/>I also like leaving the duration of certain effects up to the group. The second 7-9 option is "the Inigo Montoya" choice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396921">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396921/#Comment_396921" name="Item_110" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-09T12:10:33+00:00" title="November  9, 2012 12:10PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right - lethality can have as much to do with how you fail (death vs consequences) as with how quickly or slowly you fail (HP vs damage).<br/><br/>I love the blaze of glory option. David Artman's GLASS larp rules has a similar option, which I've always liked. With that GLASS option turned on it's very much like your two 7-9 options: if you fall, you are unconscious for a while but you can choose to get up again right away with full HP. If you choose to get up but then fall again anytime in the next hour, you are full dead-dead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17462/dungeon-world-too-many-hit-points/p2" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17462/dungeon-world-too-many-hit-points">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17462/dungeon-world-too-many-hit-points/p2" rel="prev">2</a><a class="Highlight p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17462/dungeon-world-too-many-hit-points/p3">3</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F17462%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F17462%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
