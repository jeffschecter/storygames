The company has thirty stones, the player has five. The other player bets those five (and maybe three Soap points he earned in the course of the scene by bringing in relationships and skills -- it doesn't matter). If the Company bids maybe ten points, he only gets back the five (he doesn't get the Soap -- which is a great limiter). He narrates, but he's worse off. <br/><br/>On the other hand, if the Company plays it safe and bids six, the player gets back six points -- more than he started with, since the Soap counts for him as a mean of getting resources. Ne narrates, and he's better off. <br/><br/>Since the winner is the one with most Resources, it's in the interests of everyone <i>not </i>to run the Company into the ground, since beating the Company and amassing points by means of Soap is your means of winning, and you can't get the Company's points if the Company doesn't have points to risk. <br/><br/>If the Company goes out of business, you either have to stage a bailout, or everyone loses. Because you don't have a job anymore and the economy goes to hell.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_192348">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192348/#Comment_192348" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-12T16:01:47+00:00" title="February 12, 2009  4:01PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 12, 2009 4:03PM by Thunder_God.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right, it was even in the review.

How easy is it to to just flip a coin between what Story outcome you get, and do what you do to win?<br/><br/>In other words, you create a story, but is it really something you <i>could</i> play as a board-game, ignoring the story, without it having much effect on how things would go for the different players? Aside from your related-NPCs getting involved.<br/><br/>I guess it comes down to, does the game allow those who desire it to win and just choose random story-occurences without it having much effect on their game-play? I guess it could be a powerful story, in the re-telling, and to the others, when the "Winning" guy does what it takes just to win on the mechanical level, which to him is transparent, but can it be thus transparent and "optional" to him?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_192629">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wood" title="Wood"><img alt="Wood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wood">Wood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192629/#Comment_192629" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-15T06:42:16+00:00" title="February 15, 2009  6:42AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 15, 2009 6:43AM by Wood.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am either very slow or still very new to all this, but I am still not sure I follow you.

I think I see. <br/><br/>So. Yes, I suppose it could be played as a board game, to an extent, except that the rules state that 1) the introduction of relationships has to make sense; and 2) when a relationship has been introduced and defined, that definition remains. So, for example, if your cat Joey is revealed by the Company to be the President of Slugistan, in all future Situations he is the President of Slugistan and all attempts to include him (and gain points from his introduction) must make sense in that context. Which prevents you from making it <i>just </i>a board game. <br/><br/>Having said that, if you can come up with an improbable but nonetheless plausible rationale for re-introducing Joey the Cat into a later Situation (eg in one Situation in the game he came up in, the Reps deposed him, and in the next one they wired him up as a suicide bomber. Because he had "fallen in" with terrorists -- yeah, that group of players was really into good taste) that's fun, although I suppose that makes it both morre or less like a board game. <br/><br/>I don't see it being played as a board game to be a bad thing. I have loved playing it with people who have never played an RPG, and have marketed it with some people as being "like a murder party game" -- ie, not mentioned the RPG words at all. Although murder party games are pretty much RPGs, obviously.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_192676">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192676/#Comment_192676" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-15T15:34:15+00:00" title="February 15, 2009  3:34PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Funny description about Joey, heh.<br/><br/>I don't think it's a bad thing either.
