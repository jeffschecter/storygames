You said:\n<blockquote> [...] if and when another total party kill comes along and obliterates all the 3rd-and-up level characters the players have developed, I'll be extremely interested to see how we'll cope. My ideal and theory of how D&amp;D should go is that experience points are a proof of work that proficient players will gain quickly and consistently with skill, and for this reason there's no reason whatsoever to ever give players characters above 1st level to play. If this claim is true for my GMing method and the style of our campaign, then the players should be able to continue operating essentially at their current level of campaign impact even if they lose their current characters. The players and the skills that took them to where they are is still there, so a quick visit to a 1st level dungeon at their current proficiency should bring them back to business soon enough. I'll be excited to see whether this is true, or whether the players will even want to try, once death comes. (I assume that it will come sooner or later.)<br/></blockquote>\nI have two questions for you. Curiosity killed the cat, but I've managed to survive so far.<br/><br/>1. Did they die?<br/><br/>Did this happen? If so, how did the players handle it? How did it impact the game?<br/><br/>2. You mentioned that you have a "sage" class in your D&amp;D, which replaces wizards and such, although characters do not start with any explicit magical knowledge or ability.<br/><br/>How does this work, and what does it look like? What makes and/or keeps the class appealing to players, and do they generally turn into magic-users in play, or not always?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444071/#Comment_444071" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-14T19:42:18+00:00" title="March 14, 2015  7:42PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>1. Did they die?<br/><br/>Did this happen? If so, how did the players handle it? How did it impact the game?<br/></blockquote>\nLet's see, I'll have to consult the campaign diary to remember - it's been a while.<br/><br/>So, that's something I wrote after session <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2355&amp;Mode=like">#55</a>. The most dramatic death of an important character since then was easily the death of Juanita the Cleric in session <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2373&amp;Mode=like">#73</a>, which I discussed here at Story Games in detail. It was just a single character dying, though, and the player took it like a sportsman - and he's been running one of the most successful, most creatively vivid D&amp;D campaigns in Helsinki for the last couple of years, so evidently he wasn't traumatized too much by the event <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>After that, looking at my notes, it seems that while character mortality remained reasonably high (maybe an average of 1 character death per session, with swingy peaks and lows), the most "important" characters in terms of fictional positioning, leadership and accumulated player investment did tend to survive pretty well. Peitsa's main guy after Juanita's death, for example - another cleric as it happened - is still alive and adventuring in fantasy-Rumania here in Helsinki, after surviving my frankly entirely chaotic, crazy-hard Italian wars scenario alongside the campaign protagonist captain Hans Kr\xfcger.<br/><br/>The closest to a TPK was when a party of B-string characters (not players, understand - the guys were just playing their alternates for various reasons at the time) got caught in toto by the local law and sentenced to a punishment of hard labour in the arctic wilderness of the Weird New World. This obviously wasn't like a TPK in the sense of ending stories and burning the ground of possibilities, but at least it was a total party failure that stopped their current scenarios in their tracks and sent them forth to worry about something completely different. Not a surprise if I say that this didn't do much to shake the campaign - B-string characters, and players who'd long been used to much more hardcore consequences.<br/><br/>When we ended the campaign after session <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23100&amp;Mode=like">#100</a> (no, not planned - entirely coincidental, and one could certainly critique the session numbering in my notes, too) it happened due to changes in the crew and various other creative distractions; we just never happened to continue after that, and I remember only dimly suspecting that we might be stopping the regular campaign at some point soon.<br/><br/>All in all, the answer is no; they never did die in the way I speculated about, and therefore we never got to see the direct experiment I mused on. Thinking about the outcomes, though, I'd say that play experience since has indicated that if player skill is transferable in the way I speculate there, it is also somewhat dependent on the campaign remaining the same around them; if this were not so, we certainly wouldn't have has such difficulty getting to medium levels here in Helsinki over the last few years, despite having some quite experienced players in the games <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>(That's not to be read as too strong a condemnation against the theory of competence mattering for the game; it is certainly 100% true that we play <i>like the game was in mid-levels</i> much of the time simply because the players have the skills to do so, even if the characters are mechanically technically low-level much of the time.)\n<blockquote>2. You mentioned that you have a "sage" class in your D&amp;D, which replaces wizards and such, although characters do not start with any explicit magical knowledge or ability.<br/><br/>How does this work, and what does it look like? What makes and/or keeps the class appealing to players, and do they generally turn into magic-users in play, or not always?</blockquote>\nThe specific set-up is that sages do not start with magic <i>by default</i>. Every character gets one "trait" or "feat" or whatever they'd be in English, and if you pick the "wizard training" feat, then you also start with three random 1st level spells. If you pick "saintly charism" you get the capability of blessing stuff and turning undead. There are other options as well for the different classes to start with "magic" - you could start as a fighter who's also a berserk, or as an adventurer with lycanthropy, etc.<br/><br/>Also, in the latter half of the campaign there were actually two classes that could become magicians in the traditional mold - Sage, but also the Ascetic. Either could reasonably become either a wizardly type or a saintly type, although obviously there's some bias there.<br/><br/>As for what makes the Sage appealing, it's definitely not the wussy 1st-level magic! Rather, the big selling point of the Sage is the lore checks about each and every thing you encounter. "Hey GM, I rolled 25 on my architecture check, tell me more about the fine woodcraft of this dungeon door!" The Sage class basically gets the D&amp;D bard's traditional legend lore thing as its default schtick.<br/><br/>It's not everybody's thing, but the right sort of player can do amazing things with that, particularly in the strategic realm of play. I can remember a memorable fight with stirges, though, in which one of the party Sages figured out a certain weakness of the stirge in real-time during the fight and proceeded to lead the party to victory, relying on little but half-remembered details in some natural history tome they'd read once in Amsterdam. (In fact, thinking about it, I can remember quite a few fights where actually knowing shit about what you were doing was useful. Can't expand beyond "I hit it with my thing" if you know nothing about what's going on, after all.)<br/><br/>In practice many Sages did take either the wizard option or the saint option as their first trait, opting to essentially play a traditional D&amp;D M-U or Cleric (with Legend Lore), but weird experiments on other sorts of sages weren't unknown either. For me the important thing wasn't to discourage characters being wizards or whatever, but to merely ground the idea of "wizard" clearly in a character class system that I could get behind - and that would not have been one that makes knowing magic a special division within humanity, when I fully support the idea that e.g. ritual magic and religious magic and so on are generally open to any human willing to brave it, will it and know it. So the Sage thing is important to me as a solid definition of what the character class means in the fiction ("This guy spent like a decade with their head in a book", to put it crudely), and not at all as a definition of whether they do magic or not. Be a Sage-based front-line fighter if you want, not like I care.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444096/#Comment_444096" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-16T02:42:59+00:00" title="March 16, 2015  2:42AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent answer, thank you, Eero!<br/><br/>I'm not sure I understand the bit about player skill being transferable, but it doesn't sound like a central point to this whole discussion in any case, so I'm willing to let that go!<br/><br/>Cheers!
