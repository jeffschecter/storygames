The players love it. But one of my players is having trouble finding Keys he wants for his character, and wants to write a new key. I want to support that, but we're running aground a bit.  He wants his character to be a summoner, and wants the key to have to do with that - getting XP for summoning creatures to help with combat or something like that. <br/><br/>Clinton's advice on the subject (which I want to follow) is "A Key must involve a motivation, problem, connection, duty, or loyalty."  <br/><br/>So, Story-Games, help me write a key that will move play forward the way Keys are all supposed to and at the same time help my player feel like he's getting the chance to involve his summoning extensively through the key.

So it was always the same dire badger, always the same celestial whatsit, etc. It also included harsher rules for what happened if the summoned creature died, etc. I don't remember if there was more to it, but I do recall discussing with my friend the possibility of requiring some kind of initial contacting.

You have a player who wants to be encouraged to summon things for combat effectiveness.<br/>2. You don't want to fiddle with the D&amp;D system so that he has to contact the summoned things, talk to them, or risk having them go out of control.<br/><br/>So essentially these summoned things are swords. Why doesn't the Key of Bloodlust fit? It will encourage him to fight and be effective in combat with his summons (he won't get XP otherwise), and he'll get greater rewards for defeating big enemies. Tie it to a Key of Reknown (I want to be feared as the greatest summoner, ever!) or the Key of Power (give him lots of opportunities to get favors from demons and other extraplanar creatures) and, boom, I think you've got this guy's number.  The summoned creatures don't have agency of their own, so don't just give him XP for flipping the summoning switch, it's what he does with the summons that matters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_60599">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60599/#Comment_60599" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-12T10:38:58+00:00" title="March 12, 2007 10:38AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave, I... don't know D&amp;D very well, so I'm really batting 1000 here.  But: the thing about Keys is that they direct the progress of the game.  So if a player has a key where he gets XP for interacting or talking with extraplanar stuff, it doesn't have to be stuff that he summons, it can be stuff that the GM throws in there for him to react to.  If somebody were playing in my game with a key like that, I'd throw them at a dungeon that was overrun with extraplanar critters coming through a portal, with some critters good and reasonable (and maybe trying to get back) and other critters evil or incapable of communicating.  The influence of the Key is that the game becomes about the guy's ties to the other world, not that he gets rewarded for using his mad powerz.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_60601">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60601/#Comment_60601" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-12T10:40:05+00:00" title="March 12, 2007 10:40AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Remi is wise in the ways of the TSOY.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_60607">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60607/#Comment_60607" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-12T10:58:07+00:00" title="March 12, 2007 10:58AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right on all accounts.  My suggestions weren't focused on being successful in battles (where Bloodlust works better) rather on the Summoner focusing in on that type of magic.<br/><br/>Why?  In D&amp;D although different schools exists there is often a host of spells that are so effective a crafty player chooses them every time no matter what school he focuses on (and choses what schools he cannot use based on those spells not being in the banned school).  Ploymorph is one such spell, as WAS Haste in 3.0.   Since the mechanic of memorization developes and economy there are often spells in a caster's specialist school that gets left out to focus on more effective spells (like no savvy player would be without magic missile since it hit's automatically and scales in damage as she gains levels).<br/><br/>This idea then is to reward the player for using spells from a focused group.  It says to him "I can do the effective combat thing or I can use a less effective spell and gain XP for it."  Of course my approach was to then push it further and say the summoner gains XP for using his magic despite it causing problems for him and those around him.<br/><br/>Thoughts?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_60608">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce" title="Dave Younce"><img alt="Dave Younce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g232/thomastamblyn/Avatars/GoPlayDice.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce">Dave Younce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60608/#Comment_60608" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-12T10:58:43+00:00" title="March 12, 2007 10:58AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Remi _is_ wise in the ways of TSoY.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Remi</cite>1.

The game mechanics and the Key are so perfectly aligned that they might as well be part of the same rule.<br><br>More importantly, Keys are not to my mind about risk v. reward. They're about reward, flat out. Keys are there to make players want to do awesome things, not risky things. This is especially true of the 1xp gains, which almost always are either things that will happen constantly and have almost no 'additional' risk beyond the everyday risk of being a character in an RPG. Consider the numerous Keys that pay out XP just for being in a scene with another character. In any case it seems like the idea with Keys is that they offer their own independant rewards (XP) that work orthogonally with the tactical bits of the game. There are always different ways to get XP from Keys and they never correspond to a specific mechanic (that I am aware, maybe some of the racial Keys are not like this?) This seems like something worth aiming for, and something that many of the suggested Keys achieve (the contact with outsiders one, for example. Summoning is only one way to contact outsiders.)                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_60645">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60645/#Comment_60645" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-12T13:28:04+00:00" title="March 12, 2007  1:28PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In a situation like this, I think it's useful to NOT try to make a key that wraps up everything about the character that is tied to their interest in summoning. Instead, make a key that rewards them for driving their keys in a specific way. For example:<br><br>Key of the Summoner<br>1xp: whenever your status as a summoner of extraplanar beings comes up in a scene<br/>2xp: when you attempt to solve a problem using summoning<br/>3xp: when you succeed at solving a significant problem using summoning<br/><br/>Now pair this with some other motivation, such as "key of renown". Now whenever the character does something to ehnahce their fame, they get XP, but if they do it by summoning, they get to double dip, essentially doubling their XP reward.

I think the key to making sure that Keys function the way they're supposed to is stick closely to the character's core motivations, and not the sometimes-more-obvious results of such.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_60652">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester" title="Judson_Lester"><img alt="Judson_Lester" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://judsonlester.info/initials.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester">Judson_Lester</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60652/#Comment_60652" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-12T13:45:10+00:00" title="March 12, 2007  1:45PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Keys of the Xenophile and the Master are both awesome.
