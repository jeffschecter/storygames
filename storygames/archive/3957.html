Which would mean, for instance, that all related system features would be given away, as a way to support the main product (which is quite opposite of giving away modules to support a system based product). But, before going into this, let's take a look at the issue and what I'm trying to do, as Dave Hallett presented it in the mentioned thread above :\n<blockquote>Some players do not want to be railroaded. They also do not want to have to think about "sticking to the plot" or "not doing that because the GM won't like it". They want the illusion (at least) of freedom to do as they will in an imaginary world. So trad products won't work for them out of the box.<br/><br/>On the other hand, they do not want to take on Author, much less Director stance. They don't want to think about what would be thematic, or dramatic. They don't want to know things that their characters don't, on the whole. They want the illusion (at least) of a solid, consistent world, not one where the scaffolding and nails are clearly visible. They want the GM to have secrets that they can discover, not co-create. Thus a lot of indie games are not to their taste either.<br/><br/>The GM who would support these players has a difficult life. They must prepare enough detailed material that they can communicate a world with conviction and colour. This world must be full of interesting characters who are fun to meet. And it must have both interesting events going on without the PC's involvement, and opportunities for the PCs to have a real effect on it. Aspects of the world must be tailored to engage the PCs in interesting ways, without seeming too solipsistic or unbelievable. And at any moment the PCs can and will do something entirely unexpected that renders vast chunks of prep quite useless.<br/><br/>I don't see a lot of support out there for such a GM. Some, but not much. Little advice on how to prepare economically, or algorithms/models that they can use. Some of the "indie" theory is good, but can be hampered by incompatible underlying assumptions. Towns in Dogs has the right sort of idea, IMO, but it's very specific.</blockquote>\nAnd one last thing before starting, <b>the purpose of this thread</b> :<br/>I'll try to explain what I do, and how I do it, but from the starting points of questions. So, I expect you to comment the answers, but also, and maybe most important, the questions (and I know beforehand I'll forget something). Maybe the idea would be to produce some kind of power 19, but directed toward that kind of product (because, well, when you do only setting/situations, the power 19 is kind of odd, and some questions can't be answered). And I'm quite sure other answers than mine would produce excellent product, but structured in a different way.<br/><br/>As my post is too long, the questions are coming below ...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_88716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pells" title="pells"><img alt="pells" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/teaser/avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pells">pells</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88716/#Comment_88716" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-18T10:34:19+00:00" title="August 18, 2007 10:34AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>How do you avoid railroading ?</b><br/>To avoid any kind of pure railroading or even metaplot, Avalanche is using a multi plots approach, occurring <i>at the same time</i>. So, the PCs can't take part in all of them ; they must choose. And inside their chosen path, they have a lot of freedom, since even if they impact a lot the situations provided for that choice, to a point where it becomes useless, there are still other things going on.<br/><br/><b>What kind of setting are you proposing ? What is it made of ?</b><br/>Avalanche presents quite a typical setting, medieval fantasy one. But, this setting is provided for upcoming stakes ; things will be described in the situations. The setting only provides the main characters, the leaders of important factions, for instance. Secondaries characters are not presented. Also, the setting presents places (regions, main cities, singular ones), races, objects of importance and factions. Those are written in a worst case scenario style ; if the situations don't go as written, what are their plans, and the resources they dispose to achieve it. Finally, each element is presented with its own personal timeline (history).<br/><br/><b>What kind of situations are you proposing ? How are they related to the setting ?</b><br/>Avalanche presents the situations that comes in based on the original situation (ie the setting). Each situation is 250 words, illustrated, paragraph, presenting the events of the "world" from a very high point of view. Note that, most of the time, the DM won't be able to use those events directly into play. For example, you might have a situation that says "Opposing forces to the power are making guerilla assaults on the troops of the king", so this situation presents events of the kingdom, but not the exact one the PCs will encounter. Also, the situations are written for a given <i>time and place</i>. All the situations are provided thru a calendar, as a way to manage the multi plots aspect of Avalanche.<br/><br/><b>What do you do with the PCs in the original product ?</b><br/>As a way to avoid railroading, the PCs are never, never mentioned in the original product ; there is no predefined place for them in the world, there is nothing expected from them.<br/><br/><b>What are the PCs suppose to do ? What role can they take ?</b><br/>PCs are not "supposed" to do anything. They do what they want, choose their side, take on the stakes they want. They can take any role they want, be it heroes, main characters already written, bad guys, orcs .... anything.<br/><br/><b>Using your product, is there a GM, and what is his exact role ?</b><br/>There is a GM. He has a quite typical role (then again, this depends also a lot about the system used), but he needs to manage the calendar also. He will need to play the campaign on a day to day basis and manage which situations provided are in the past, the present or the future. Also, as secondaries elements are not provided, the DM has to create them, anyway he wants (then again, related to system).<br/><br/><b>How does your product help the DM during prep ?</b><br/>Avalanche being calendar based, written in a modular way (remember, short events), the DM can easily point out what part of the product he needs for the upcoming session.<br/><br/><b>How does your product help the DM during play ?</b><br/>Avalanche provides a backbone upon which the DM builds what he needs for its session. Avalanche being calendar based, it helps a lot the DM to manage the metatime (time elapsed in the fiction world) and also manage the situations in which the PCs do no take part in.<br/><br/><b>How does your product react to the PC's interference ?</b><br/>All the situations provided are linked together, as a way to pinpoint the exact influence of the PCs on the provided situations. Also, being multi plots, even if the PCs change completely one part, there would much for them to do after that. Also, Avalanche uses what is called <i>passage points</i> between any two parts of the product (a part being a season). As each part is composed of about 300 situations, managing the impact of the players might become a mess. The idea is to provide simple questions between each part. For instance, if in the first part there is a sequence of situations that describe the fall of one of the main city, a passage point would be "Is the city razed ? Is the power still in place ?". From that point on, the DM do not look at the situations themselves, but more in the overall context.<br/><br/><b>How do you approach systems features toward your product ?</b><br/>Characters sheets will be provided for the main characters and typical secondaries one, using three distinct systems : d20, TSOY and Fudge.<br/><br/><b>Why would someone buys this and not created it ?</b><br/>Avalanche thinks itself as some kind of homebrew campaign, but with a lot of work behind it. And its main concern is the coherence of the events of the world, as they happen everywhere at the same time. Sure, a DM could build something like Avalanche, but that would mean a lot, but a lot of work, since only about 25/30 % of the original product would be used. Also, Avalanche is fully illustrated.<br/><br/>And I'm quite sure there are others very important questions one has to ask himself ...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_88724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88724/#Comment_88724" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-18T12:05:15+00:00" title="August 18, 2007 12:05PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just a very quick side comment: I think it might be useful to reframe a couple of the questions in a more positive/proactive way. Rather than "avoiding railroading," what is it you want the product to actively <i>promote?</i> Several of the questions seem to have answers leading to what you <i>don't </i>want, but not necessarily what you <i>do </i>want.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89462">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pells" title="pells"><img alt="pells" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/teaser/avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pells">pells</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89462/#Comment_89462" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-22T09:42:25+00:00" title="August 22, 2007  9:42AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, let's try this the other way around. And maybe I forgot some obvious questions !!! I'll leave my answers beside for the moment. And a big question that I still have : how do we designate those products ? Do I just say "product" ?<br/><br/><b>What is your product about ?</b><br/>Seems to me like a fair question. Is your setting fantasy, sci-fi, pulp ... ? I guess we should start with this ...<br/><br/><b>What are your situations about ?</b><br/>Another very basic question. Is it about romance, high adventure, political intrigues ? What is at stake ?<br/><br/><b>How does your product promote the freedom of the players to build their story ?</b><br/>Or, how to avoid railroading in a larger sense.<br/><br/><b>Using this product, what will the game mostly look like ? And in what way do you promote it ?</b><br/>Then again, a very open question, which would allow to present design and real impact how game play.<br/><br/>Is it better ? I still don't know which questions I should keep and in what order. And I think many others are still missing.<br/>I don't know. Which questions would you like to be seen answered in all presentation of such a product ?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
