I trotted out a few options, and then said I had a game experiment in mind which was more involved, if they were interested. I pitched it to them as "creating a pilot for a new teen supernatural drama", and then pulled out a Fiasco playset I made especially for Monsterhearts, <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/17956/it-all-ends-in-tears-monsterhearts-and-fiasco" rel="nofollow">It All Ends in Tears</a>. They were sold pretty much immediately. One of the players seemed on the fence, and then read through a bit of the playset and said, "Oh, man! So much dysfunction. Ok, I'm in!"<br/><br/>Here's how it went down, for people curious about the setup process. Next, I'll post what we came up with as a result, and then finally ask you for some points of advice on where to go next.<br/><br/>We spent most of the evening essentially brainstorming through the setup of the game, not unlike a PTA pitch session, and only played through a handful of scenes. We were interrupted on a couple of occasions by some unfortunate emergencies, and had to stop the game, then start up again. People were having so much fun riffing off the elements provided them by the game (the playset options, the Skins, and the Sex Move / Darkest Self descriptions all gave the players solid inspiration) that I had to work hard to rein it in and get to actually playing.<br/><br/>So, step by step (and much more to come later)...<br/><br/><br/><b>*** First step: the playset setup.</b><br/><br/>Here are the Elements we generated between pairs of characters. We ended up with a lot more Elements than originally planned because a fourth player joined in towards the end, so we rolled eight more dice to tie his character in (I figured rolling a small number of dice wouldn't create enough meaningful choice). We also, on a couple of occasions, rolled for details from the playset when we needed inspiration or felt like another detail would be helpful (essentially using the playset as a random generator when we weren't sure what should come next).<br/><br/><i>A Quick Note: To help guide the process, I chose a playbook for an "MC character" (the Queen) so I could go through the setup with the players and explain what choices would be made at any given point. However, in the end, Cordelia the Queen remained an NPC, not a PC, unless another player (who had to cancel) joins us next time.<br/></i><br/><br/>[Text deleted: much easier to see visually.]<br/><br/><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/jerm74dld9z02w0/Relationship%20map%20%28from%20playset%29.pdf?m" rel="nofollow">Relationship map at the end of the Setup</a><br/><br/><br/><b>*** Second step:</b><br/><br/>Choosing Skins. We choose the Vampire for Cassius, the Werewolf for Flinch, the Mortal for Lilith, and the Queen for Cordelia. <br/><br/>(Obviously, we chose the names after choosing Skins, not before--i.e. at this point in the process. But using the names above [i.e. in step one] seemed easier then writing this all out with placeholders like PC 1, PC 2, etc., and then making you, the reader, figure out which corresponds to which afterwards. So I included the names we ended up with in the character pairs above.)<br/><br/>Here are the relevant details we got from the Skin choices:<br/><br/>Cassius (Vampire)<br/>* Someone saved your unlife (we quite naturally and intuitively combined this with "a murder by accident, and the person you thought you killed")<br/><br/>Lilith (Mortal)<br/>* Has a lover/True Love<br/><br/>Flinch (Werewolf)<br/>* Has been observing someone for a while, their scent is unmistakable to him now... (we decided this obviously tied in to "stalker and object of powerful obsession")<br/><br/>Cordelia the Queen, once again, turned into an NPC at this point. We rolled a Reputation for her, and chose "scandalously promiscuous".<br/><br/><br/>Reading through the Sex Moves and Darkest Selves inspired everyone quite a lot during this phase, as well.<br/><br/>We then talked about each Element in turn and decided how it would be interpreted. (For example, Flinch and Lilith are "infamous exes". So, is Flinch still her lover, or has she rebounded to someone new since the breakup?)<br/><br/>Next up... the result of the brainstorm/setup/pitch.<br/><br/>(If you want to, take a shot at what this setup would suggest to you, we can compare notes afterwards!)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_407901">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407901/#Comment_407901" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-03T19:39:49+00:00" title="March  3, 2013  7:39PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 3, 2013 7:51PM by Paul_T.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dramatis Personae, thus far<br/><br/>Main cast:<br/><br/>* <b>Cassius</b>, newly turned vampire<br/>* <b>Flinch</b>, bisexual werewolf in his last year of school... once again<br/>* <b>Lilith</b>, Flinch's old flame<br/><br/>Secondary characters:<br/><br/>* <b>Cordelia</b>, most hot/popular girl at school and lacrosse team captain, as well as the daughter of the mayor.

However, when Flinch realizes he's got this monstrous rage in him, he decides he has to push her away before he hurts the one person he loves. <br/><br/>Flinch breaks up with Lilith in a horrible, humiliating, and very public way. Their breakup is now legendary at the high school. <i>("Infamous exes")</i><br/><br/>Flinch and Lilith have some history we haven't entirely established: something significant happened between them in one of her father's cars, <i>a dented old Buick with a broken trunk</i> (which is beginning to smell rather disgusting, but the lock on the trunk is broken and it won't open).<br/><br/>Closer to the present time, Lilith meets Cassius, this cool, beautiful but somewhat distant kid who doesn't seem to fit in. She falls in love with him and they start getting involved with each other. (Lilith chooses Cassius as her <i>lover</i>.)<br/><br/>One day, his thirst for blood pounding in his ears while starting to get physical with Lilith at her house, Cassius almost loses control and sucks the blood out of Lilith's favourite pet. She doesn't know yet; she just thinks her pet is missing. <i>("The corpse of a dead animal, half-eaten")</i><br/><br/>Meanwhile, uses his heightened wolf-senses, Flinch catches Pervy Pete, the janitor, taping the girls' lacrosse team in the showers. Rather than turn him in, Flinch blackmails him, saying he won't tell anyone so long as Pervy Pete gives his copies of the videos he makes. They start working together, taping the girls after each game. <i>("In the wrong hands, graphic pornography")</i><br/><br/>Flinch discovers that Pervy Pete has all kinds of weird occult paraphernalia in his cold, run-down home. <i>("Into the really weird shit")</i><br/><br/><b>The Story so Far</b><br/><br/><i>About half brainstormed due to setup choice, and half played out in actual scenes</i><br/><br/>In the opening sequence of the show, we see Flinch and Cordelia driving down a dark country road just outside of town in her dad's bright red convertible. They're heading home from a party, and Cordelia isn't paying too much attention to the road.<br/><br/>Cassius, a new vampire, is desperately trying to figure out how to deal with this bizarre thirst for blood. He's out in the Shady Elms, near Gus's Gas, feeding on squirrels and whatever else he can find.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for Cassius, he happens to be crossing the road in the dark when Cordelia and Flinch are speeding home. They run right into him, and Cassius is thrown onto the edge of the road, basically dead. <i>("A murder by accident...")</i><br/><br/>Cordelia, terrified, decides to get out of there as quickly as possible, and they speed off. Flinch, however, is bothered by something: that kid's smell just wasn't right. Stranger yet, he smells like his former lover: Lilith.<br/><br/>Flinch returns to the scene of the crime alone later that night. "I... need... blood", Cassius whispers, dying, in Flinch's arms. Smelling his lover's scent on him, Flinch is unable to resist, and lets Cassius sink his teeth into his flesh. The fresh blood revives him, saving his life. <i>("Someone saved your unlife")</i><br/><br/>This is the first time Cassius has ever fed on a human.<br/><br/>Cassius is not seen again for some time after that, but Flinch develops an obsession with him: who is this strange creature, and why does he smell like Lilith? <i>("Stalker and object of powerful obsession")</i><br/><br/>Meanwhile, Flinch realizes that he forgot his laptop in Cordelia's dad's car. When he recovers it much later (the mayor's wife gives him a call and tells him she found his laptop), he's glad to have it back... until he notices that some of the video files of the girls' showers are missing. <i>("In the wrong hands...")</i><br/><br/><b>At School</b><br/><br/>On his first day back at school, Cassius wanders into the very brightly lit cafeteria (I asked him: "When and where do you feel most uncomfortable and powerless on a typical school day?"). After bumping into Joe (a senior jock), Cassius is surrounded by Cordelia and her cronies. Cordelia is taking a real interest in him. He <i>manipulates</i> her, convincing her to leave for "a walk" with him, alone. This doesn't go unnoticed by anyone, especially Flinch, who follows them out.<br/><br/>Their conversation is interrupted by Mr. Jacobs, the new ethics teacher, who demands to know why Cassius hasn't been in class, and asks for a doctor's note. To avoid Mr. Jacobs, Cassius returns to the cafeteria and forces himself to eat garlic bread until he is painfully sick.<br/><br/>Flinch confronts Cordelia, telling her to stay away from Cassius (who, it appears, he's developing quite a crush on). Cordelia clues in to this, realizing that Flinch may have strong feelings for Cassius. <i>(An MC move due to a failed manipulate roll.)</i><br/><br/>Cassius, on the other hand, wants more of Flinch's blood... and he's not afraid to blackmail him to get it. <br/><br/><i>(generated by "Need... to get respect by showing them they shouldn't have fucked with you" -- Flinch wants Cassius to show him some gratitude for saving his life instead of being so maddeningly cold, Cassius wants Flinch to let him feed again, and threatens to tell everyone about the hit and run if he won't)</i><br/><br/>Meanwhile, Lilith ponders the disappearance of Mrs. Lloyd, the old ethics teacher, and decides she needs to find out what happened to her. <i>("Need... to get some answers about the disappearance of a teacher")</i><br/><br/>Back in the cafeteria, "Pervy Pete" the janitor shows up and, in front of everyone, leans over to Flinch and winks, "Big game tonight, eh?", while tapping his backpack full of recording equipment. (Referring to their usual practice of setting up cameras in the girls' showers after lacrosse matches.) Flinch tells him to stay the fuck away from him...<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_407904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407904/#Comment_407904" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-03T20:14:44+00:00" title="March  3, 2013  8:14PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now, some commentary:<br/><br/>I was totally astounded by the high level of investment these non-gamers immediately attached to the game. They got excited about their characters, didn't want to go home, wanted to develop more details about the characters' backstories, etc. - kind of like what most GMs/MCs *wish* their players did after every game.<br/><br/>At the end of the evening, when we finally convinced each other it was time to go home (and it was several hours later than we'd planned, we were all half-asleep, and it had been a draining evening due to various out-of-game serious life emergencies which had interrupted our progress), Flinch's player commented:<br/><br/>--"Look! We've re-created <i>Twilight</i>! Except it's way, way better!"<br/>--"Wow, you're totally right."<br/>--"I wish this was on TV!"<br/>--"I'm going to go home and write some fiction based on this!"<br/><br/>On the way out, the players were calling out to each other:<br/><br/>--"I love you, Lilith!"<br/>--"So do I!

I think having a whole bunch of teen profile pics is invaluable for visual reference as NPCs come and go. Strings make the game sing, so have a physical 'token' for each string... A piece of yarn or hair or elastic or sinew (we used strips of jerky that we ate when the string was spent); whatever feels right for the character.

I just want to do some of this prep out in the open, and get a sense of how other people might do it, as well. I'm sure I'll learn something in the process; maybe it'll be useful to someone else, too. I want to make sure the game starts with something strong and active next time (since we spent so much time just brainstorming, and little time playing, in this first session). So, what jumps out at you? Where would you "and PUSH there"?\n<blockquote>The party / fight / game scene is always a sure-fire winner.</blockquote>\nAh, yes. I left out a detail: the first scenes took place at school on a Friday. Friday night is the big lacrosse game (maybe some kind of final?). This means that Pervy Pete and Flinch need to set up to record (and Flinch is feeling very conflicted about not telling his friend Cordelia that he has videos of her naked). It all means the Mayor is going to be there, to watch his daughter play...<br/><br/>Also, I'm curious what "idea" you're interested in stealing.\n<blockquote>we used strips of jerky that we ate when the string was spent</blockquote>\nWhoa! Hardcore.<br/><br/>I brought some Poker chips, to use as Strings (in three different colours). However, that means we need to notate Strings for NPCs in a different way than Strings for PCs. How did you handle this? How did you know which strip of jerky referred to which character, in other words?<br/><br/>In my ideal Monsterhearts, Strings <i>and</i> XP would be physical tokens or pieces we could pass around, but I'm not entirely sure how to handle that. I *do* have a bunch of dice in different colours, though. Hmmm.

My experience is limited, however this is what I've done in the past:<br/><br/>- Talk to the players in between games about what they'd like to do with their character (not so much grandiose character goals, but what they want to do _right now_), then have 'hooks' ready to go that will allow them to do that. I've not used them, but I imagine that MC love letters are a more subtle means of getting at their intentions than just coming out and asking them.<br/><br/>- I think about how I can connect the players' goals to each other. Lilith's ambition to be class president is fine. Lilith wanting to be class president and finding out that Cassius has something that she needs in order to get it is a plot.<br/><br/>- I check the players' skin moves. If they picked them they want to use them. My fear in MCing is being called upon to make a hard move and not having a clue, so I think about potential hard moves in case they fail.<br/><br/>- Using the above, I work out my 'anchor scenes' - these are the scenes I'll go to if the players run out of steam. If the game is buzzing then all you need to do at the end of each scene is ask one of the players "So, what do you do now?" but when it's not, you need somewhere to go. It's nice to base them on reincorporating elements that the players have forgotten so you can drop them in anytime. I find that the game keeps buzzing better if the players feel empowered to create (like they were playing a more GM-less style game) for the surroundings and the other characters. "Hey, where can my character go out at night?" "Wherever you like." "Is there a bowling alley and is this other character there?" "They are now!"\n<blockquote>what jumps out at you? Where would you "and PUSH there"?</blockquote>\nWhat jumps out at me is the disappearance of Mrs Lloyd. This doesn't really feel that incorporated so far and Lilith doesn't have a great reason to care beyond any of her classmates. I'd push that.<br/><br/>I wouldn't worry about pushing the Lilith/Cassius/Flinch triangle - the players will naturally focus on each other and push that plotline themselves. Tangled relationships will naturally spend their inherent tension and work themselves out over time. This love triangle is at the core of your game and so you want to postpone its ultimate resolution as long as possible. You do that by putting other stuff into the game to allow the relationships to be the subtext for a while and allow the big relationship changing events to emerge from the other stuff, rather than restricting the game to only using the relationship to feed itself.<br/><br/>Pervy Pete doesn't sound like he needs any pushing. I think your group have taken him into their hearts. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Your dropbox link is crashing my computer BTW. Might just be me.\n<blockquote>I brought some Poker chips, to use as Strings (in three different colours). However, that means we need to notate Strings for NPCs in a different way than Strings for PCs. How did you handle this? In my ideal Monsterhearts, Strings and XP would be physical tokens or pieces we could pass around, but I'm not entirely sure how to handle that. I *do* have a bunch of dice in different colours, though. Hmmm. Maybe I could use those? </blockquote>\nI use marker slips (like small post-it notes) for strings, using a colour for each PC and then a plain one you can write on for their strings on NPCs.<br/>I've never used markers for xp. I guess you could use candy like skittles and let them eat it once they advance (and if they eat it before then... well, it's lost!). Brings a new angle to spending a string to offer someone a piece of candy (xp) to do something.<br/>I do use different colour dice, but only to roll different stats (so I have red 'hot' dice, blue 'cold' dice, yellow 'volatile' and black 'dark').

I read through the Monsterhearts text today and looked through all the Principles and Hard Moves, and tried to generate an idea for each one. Some things definitely jumped out at me. (I'll be back to write them up tomorrow. I have to leave shortly, so it will have to wait.)<br/><br/>I bought some string today, in different colours. I'll try to use that! (Although teeth and seaweed... that makes my purchase seem pretty bland now in comparison. Wow!)<br/><br/>The most obvious connection for Mrs. Lloyd is that her body is in the old Buick Lilith's father bought. That's clearly what the players expect. I'm not sure whether it's better to go with their expectations or against them here. In any case, she won't be all that interesting until I ask some provocative questions about her. (And who knows, one of the players might answer, "...and <i>that's</i> why I had to get her out of the picture.")<br/><br/>Anyway:<br/><br/>OK, so now that we have some good ideas of the general approach you're each taking. How do you turn those general principles into specific prep for the game? <br/><br/>* What questions would you want to ask of the players? <br/>* What kind of "hooks" would you be preparing for those answers? (I'd love if you could use something we already have an answer to as an example, or a hypothetical question that we can narrow down the possible answers to.)<br/>* What kinds of "anchor scenes" seem particularly tempting or interesting in this case?

I normally use it in AW but it slipped my mind somehow this time, so thank you for the reminder.)<br/><br/>The moves:<br/><br/>Lilith: <i>Excuses are my Armour</i> and <i>Down the Rabbit Hole</i> (probably the most evocative set, right there)<br/>Cassius: <i>The Feeding</i> and <i>Invited</i><br/>Flinch: <i>Heightened Senses</i> and <i>Primal Dominance</i><br/><br/>In reverse order:<br/><br/>Flinch's moves tell me I should include some intense scenes, fraught with danger, and some antagonists for Flinch who might either be a) worthy opponents, or b) weak, pathetic people he knows he could crush. The former is a challenge; the latter asks how far he is willing to go to gain leverage over someone. Joe and Cordelia seems like good material for this purpose. The mayor as well. I'm also thinking it would be interesting to endanger the whole shower-taping shenanigan in a dangerous way (maybe the police are tipped and arrive to investigate in the middle of the action?).<br/><br/>Cassius: <i>The Feeding</i> doesn't inspire me a whole lot right now, aside from him feeding on Lilith or Flinch. Although I will definitely offer him some victims should he be sorely wounded again. <i>Invited</i> inspires me with an idea, actually: I'm thinking Cordelia might invite him to her house for a "party" (but really with the intention to seduce him).<br/><br/>Lilith's moves are great story material but aren't giving me anything fantastic off the top of my head. "Excuses..." suggests that I should create situations where Cassius would be tempted to take advantage of her, but nothing comes immediately to mind. This is essentially Cassius's player's job; I just need to find a way to tempt him to do so, perhaps. Could an NPC blame him for something he hasn't even done, giving her a chance to make excuses for his behaviour? Not sure.<br/><br/><i>Down the Rabbit Hole</i> tells me, straight up, that I need to give her some difficult situations to explore. Pervy Pete could play into this, but Mrs. Lloyd's disappearance is obviously front-and-center here. Any specific ideas? My hands are tied just a *little* because I told the group I would try to keep the supernatural to a minimum, so I would prefer to keep it subtle at most.<br/><br/>(Of course, I will begin by asking Lilith and Cassius some provocative questions about why she's so important to them. Probably ask one of them why they cared about her--Lilith, I'm guessing--and the other why they hated, feared, or suspected her.)<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Well, that's pretty fruitful right there. Definitely will be adding "look over the Skin moves" to my bag of Monsterhearts prep tricks.

The big game tonight - or the aftermath - seems the most obvious starting point.\n<blockquote>What questions would you want to ask of the players? </blockquote>\nPushing the disappearance of Mrs Lloyd - 3 questions, ask one to each player, doesn't matter which:<br/>- What secret of yours did Mrs Lloyd discover? Why did she not already reveal it?<br/>- What was Mrs Lloyd doing to get you into a good college? Why were you depending on this?<br/>- You met Mrs Lloyd out of school in a dark bar late at night. Why didn't she recognise you? When she made a pass on you, did you accept or not? What did her husband do when he found out? <br/>Pushing the disappearance of Mrs Lloyd - To Lilith: Why don't the police seem to care about Mrs Lloyd's disappearance? What have you done to find out what happened to her?<br/><br/>Pushing Cassius &amp; Cordelia - To Cassius: How do you know it was Cordelia father's car who hit you? What evidence do you have to prove it?<br/><br/>Pushing Cassius &amp; Lilith - To Cassius: Where did you leave Lilith's pet? Why do you now think you left it in the wrong place?<br/><br/>Pushing Cassius &amp; Flinch - To Lilith: What do you know from your relationship with Flinch which would destroy his rep at the school if it got out? Why would you confide it to Cassius? <br/><br/>Pushing Cassius &amp; Lilith - To Lilith: How do you know Pervy Pete's brother Gus? What has he offered to do for you to get you closer to Cassius? What does he want in return? Why can't you give it to him just yet?<br/><br/>Pushing Slayde Cooper: - To Flinch: How have you previously met Slayde Cooper? Why are you specifically due to meet him when he visits the school later this week? Why don't you want him to see you?<br/><br/>Pushing Pervy Pete - To Flinch: What specific tape does Pervy Pete have that he won't give you? Why do you want it so badly?<br/><br/>\n<blockquote>What kind of "hooks" would you be preparing for those answers? (I'd love if you could use something we already have an answer to as an example, or a hypothetical question that we can narrow down the possible answers to.) </blockquote>\nIt's tough to give specifics here as it really depends on what they want to do. Let's use some hypotheticals:<br/>- Lilith wants to investigate what happened to Mrs Lloyd - what information will she find that will point her in the right direction? (how she actually investigates doesn't have to matter, she can get the same clue if she goes to talk to the husband, goes to the police, checks out her employment record etc.)<br/>- Cassius wants to learn what he has really become - what indication does Pervy Pete give that he knows about vampires? <br/>- Flinch wants to explore his sexuality - who does he know who's LGBT? What happened to the last teen who came out at the school?\n<blockquote>What kinds of "anchor scenes" seem particularly tempting or interesting in this case? What draws your attention? </blockquote>\nYou've already got the Cordelia invites Cassius around to her house.<br/>Flinch encounters Joe physically dominating another teen Flinch hates. Joe invites Flinch to join in.<br/>Mr Jacobs runs an experiment which requires the teens to pair up.<br/>The Mayor is coming to visit the school and the PCs are roped into prepping something.<br/>Lilith finds her dead pet in front of her house with bite marks that look exactly like those she's seen on Flinch's neck.<br/>Cassius is confronted by a vampire wannabe who wants him to turn them.<br/>Flinch sees something on one of Pervy Pete's tapes that he shouldn't.<br/>Lilith witnesses a crime - or something that appears to be a crime or could be building to a crime.<br/>Pervy Pete invites Lilith around to his house to show her something about Cassius.<br/><br/>If Lilith is going to investigate Mrs Lloyd's death, then you should have an anchor scene for that. Like opening the boot of the Buick, a scene where you know you can send her to.\n<blockquote>What do the moves tell you?  </blockquote>\nLilith - Both gold. 'Rabbit Hole' gives you carte blanche to give her all sorts of dangerous situations, without having to justify why she would get involved (as opposed to calling the police or just walking on). 'Excuses' gives you permission to take the Mortal to a darker place. The blatant problems with her lover don't have to come from Cassius, see the Pervy Pete anchor above. <br/>Cassius - The Feeding sparks off the vampire wannabe anchor. He's confused about wanting blood - let's give him someone who's offering it willingly.<br/>Flinch - I find Heightened Senses pretty meh. It's a pain because they can use it to require you to generate answers to their questions. Primal Dominance is cool though, see my anchor above re Joe.\n<blockquote>The most obvious connection for Mrs. Lloyd is that her body is in the old Buick Lilith's father bought. That's clearly what the players expect. I'm not sure whether it's better to go with their expectations or against them here. </blockquote>\nTake some advice from Play Unsafe by Graham Walmsley. Don't be afraid of being obvious. I'll tell you the problem with going against their expectations here - and putting a stranger or one of their missing parents in there - the players won't know how to integrate it into their understanding of the story. When someone doesn't understand the story, they won't want to add to it - they become passengers, waiting for you to show them the next sight on their tour. I've tried to do that - tried to defy expectations and throw something completely unexpected in there. People said "Oh" and them promptly failed to develop it any further. I could have carried on developing my subplot on my own, but then you're just one guy sitting in a corner playing with himself and we all know what that is.<br/><br/>I understand what you want - you want the wide-eyed look of mind-blown amazement that people get when they're told something they didn't expect and is awesome at the same time. You want to surprise them. You can do that, but don't do it by throwing them something that will be completely unexpected. They won't be able to engage with it. Instead, give them what they expect, but put a little twist on it. It's the body of Mrs Lloyd, but she suddenly jumps up and takes a swing at one of them. She's a ghoul or a vampire or a zombie or something else. There's a body of a huge dog in there - and its wearing a piece of jewellery that Mrs Lloyd always used to wear. etc etc. Give them a twist, but make sure you communicate to them how they should incorporate it into the story.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ishnub" title="Ishnub"><img alt="Ishnub" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ishnub">Ishnub</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408180/#Comment_408180" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-05T15:36:39+00:00" title="March  5, 2013  3:36PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 5, 2013 3:48PM by Ishnub.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good general advice we tend to use in our * World game sessions is the MC writes every player a love letter. This love letter has some flavor text setting the mood and helping the players slip rapidly back into character and an associated roll which serves to instantly introduce some sort of problem, conflict or interaction for the PC's. Usualy it woudl either harken back to the previous session or an event that occurred or foreshadow an event or theme for the current session.<br/><br/>An example Love Letter from our MH game follows. This is paraphrased since I don't have the letter here in front of me: <br/>Dear Grace (the Ghoul),<br/><br/>As you sit in Casey's (the Werewolf) truck you absent mindedly slip your hand into your pocket. Only to find the bloody rag from earlier when Casey cut his hand wadded up inside. How did that get in there? You don't remember putting it there. Regardless, as you pull out your hand you see it covered in blood and catch the coppery, delicious scent. You realize your ravenously hungry. You Need To Feed and fast. <br/><br/>Roll +Cold: <br/>10+ You fight back the Hunger and regain total control of yourself. A close call. <br/> 7+  It takes every bit of willpower to stay under control. You need to find something to eat and you need to do it fast before your resolve crumbles. <br/> 6-  Succumb to your <i>Darkest Self</i>.<br/><br/>This particular love letter led to Casey after leaving the sheriffs station finding Grace no longer waiting in the truck. And instead finding Grace behind the nearby grocery store, hiding behind the dumpster, cramming raw meat she had just bought as fast as she could down her gullet. An awkward moment for the both of them. Since it was early in the season and neither knew of the others nature.   Anyways, you get the idea of how  a few minutes of MC prep can kickstart a session.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408196/#Comment_408196" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-05T19:09:25+00:00" title="March  5, 2013  7:09PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 5, 2013 7:10PM by Paul_T.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah!

I'll include a few, but not so much as to detract from the basic love triangle developing.<br/><br/>And your advice about the trunk of the Buick is excellent, as well: a great analysis for why "coming out of left field" can hurt the game under certain circumstances. Still, the players are expecting me to say something interesting (they already expect to find Mrs. Lloyd in the trunk, after all, so what new information will they learn if they open it?). So, what to do?<br/><br/>You point out precisely the correct answer to this dilemma: keep the answer along obvious lines (i.e. related to Mrs. Lloyd), but add a surprising twist. It could be even be much less weird, like the signs of an unusual murder method. Or it could be pretty bizarre, like a dead wolf... with a live human hand inside its belly, wearing Mrs. Lloyd's wedding ring. I'll think on this!<br/><br/>A question about the whole Mrs. Lloyd issue: you bring up several examples of pushing an "investigative" angle on her disappearance, with Lilith as the sleuth. How would you handle this as a Monsterhearts MC? Would you figure out the mysterious backstory by yourself, then drop clues, or let it all come together by asking the players questions, or something in-between?

What did you have in mind when you wrote those questions? </blockquote>\nThis might have been a reflection of my own experience with MH campaign (as opposed to one-offs) where the player wanted something a bit more Veronica Mars so investigating into the dark underside of the school and town featured a large part.<br/><br/>I should mention that IMO investigations in MH should be entirely optional. Just like another other hooks, they're there if the players want them, but they should never feel railroaded into it (though there could legitimately be consequences down the road of them ignoring it). MH is a game about sorting through screwed up people and screwed up relationships. Investigations are an optional spice rather than a staple.<br/><br/>Getting into the meat of it. You can do an investigation entirely improv if you like (read Trail of Cthulhu The Armitage Files for a lot of thoughts on that), but I preferred not to.  How did I handle it?<br/>- I would decide if I wanted to establish the 'final truth' beforehand or not. Usually, I did, but occasionally I was happy to lay down hooks, but not worry too much about them until the player was definitely biting on it. <br/>- Either way, I would establish several facts which would then be given out as the player bit on hooks. Once they've digested some of them, I'd reflect on how their mind is working - maybe adjust my own final truth - and then work out what was missing, What did they still need to know to reach the final truth? These kind of investigations don't typically get resolved in a single session, so there's no problem laying down lots of material off the cuff in one session and then take a breather to work out how it might all fit together before the next one.<br/>- I'd also have in place several red herrings (my god, why is all my terminology aquatic?) in order to maintain some surprise at the reveal. Depending on how the player's thoughts were progressing, I could swap out the intended culprit for a red herring part way through if I thought it would be better.<br/><br/>Let's give you a specific example from my own game:<br/>- The final truth (I decided to establish this from the start) - one of the students was murdered by being drowned in a toilet by the nerdy (but secretly quite psychotic) home room teacher in a fit of rage because they mistakenly believed the student vandalised their prized vintage car. (I completely stole this from a tv show which I knew the player hadn't seen.)<br/>- My starting facts:<br/>-- the boy had disappeared<br/>-- his body was hidden on campus<br/>-- he'd been drowned, though he was nowhere near water<br/>- I connected each fact with a hook (though in truth I could have - and indeed had to - supply facts through different means to react to what the player was doing):<br/>-- the victim had disappeared (hook: he was still wandering around school as a ghost, though he can't speak and is scared of the player because she can see him)<br/>-- his body was hidden on campus  (hook: there's a bad smell coming from the old groundkeeper's hut on the far side of the playing fields)<br/>-- he'd been drowned, though he was nowhere near water (hook: the player's mother was the chief at the local hospital, the player could find out from her or looking at the autopsy report)<br/>- Once the player had all these facts, she should be actively on the hunt and looking for the culprit so at this point my red herrings kick in:<br/>-- a hot-tempered sports teacher who often had run-ins with the boy because he was terribly unathletic<br/>-- a Queen student (also captain of the lacrosse team, weird how these similarities pop up) who thinks the boy has been stalking her and the player has seen that the Queen has extremely violent reactions when she feels threatened (such as beating up a potential attacker and then trying to get the player to come with her to dump him deep in the woods).<br/>-- and... err.... someone else I've forgotten<br/><br/>Let me tell you the mistake I made, though (and this should be handled by your provocative questions). I forgot to give her any stake in the victim. In my head, she was supposed to bite on the hooks in order (she communicates with the ghost who leads her to the body which results in the autopsy). What happened though was she reacted in character - because the victim was fat and clearly unpopular (in fairness, no one else could see him) - the player, as a transfer student, didn't want to be seen dead with him. Instead, what happened was that she happened to go out to the hut first and then bite on the 'smell' hook. This then led to the 'moment of awesome' when she realised that this kid whom she'd just assumed that everyone ignored was actually a ghost.\n<blockquote>* Where do you think it would be interesting for the "peeping tom" videos to end up? (Remember, what we've established so far is that the laptop spent some time at the mayor's house, and was returned by the mayor's wife.).</blockquote>\nThat's actually not the whole story though, is it. The laptop spent some time at the mayor's house and was then returned _with some of the videos removed_.<br/><br/>Now, you have the videos which you can play straight as leverage material i.e. the mayor, the wife or the daughter has them and uses them as leverage over Flinch. _But_ that doesn't explain why some of them were removed. That can only be explained by one of the following:<br/>- the videos removed contained something that the person didn't want Flinch to see. In which case, that person is ultimately going to be gunning for Pervy Pete via Flinch in order to destroy any other copies.<br/>- the videos that _weren't_ removed contained something that the person _did_ want Flinch to see. In which case, that person is going to follow up with Flinch to ask "Did you watch them?" Given the supposed content, I would assume that there's something else on those tapes beyond the girls showering - like a tape showing a person taking something, planting something, putting something in the water, two people talking about sensitive information, a person appearing when they shouldn't be alive (Mrs Lloyd) or not appearing on tape when they should (imagine that Cassius went in there but doesn't register on the tape). And that can be connected to any other plot that you want to hook.\n<blockquote>* Another element that came up during the pitch session was that the Mayor is trying to evict/buy out Cassius's single mother. He wants to demolish the strip of run-down homes by Shady Elms and sell the land to developers.<br/><br/>I'd love to bring this in to this whole situation in some meaningful way, perhaps a scene where Cassius comes home to find the Mayor at his home talking to his mother.</blockquote>\nThat scene sounds fine. The Mayor is okay if you want to paint him as the big bad and unify the PC's opinion about him. More interesting though would be if you play him so that one PC (like Cassius) absolutely loathes him, while another PC ends up really liking him and wanting to protect (from people like Cassius). That's your classic PC-NPC-PC triangle.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EpistolaryRichard" title="EpistolaryRichard"><img alt="EpistolaryRichard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EpistolaryRichard">EpistolaryRichard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408293/#Comment_408293" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-06T13:55:08+00:00" title="March  6, 2013  1:55PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>* Working in interesting details to the "disappeared teacher" situation.

I was brainstorming today, and I decided that Mrs. Lloyd should be appearing in the tapes (where she shouldn't be, of course). But I haven't yet decided whether she should just appear doing something hard-to-explain, or in some more bizarre way, like showering with the girls (and clearly much younger in the tapes than she should have been at the time they were made).<br/><br/>Your insights on the role of mystery in this game seem right on, to me. I think the key is always always tying it back in to the inter-character relationships, pointing the discoveries back into the relationship map between the main characters. A mystery is just a small side-point to their passions and fears, and you have to be gentle with it so it doesn't take over.<br/><br/>Its main purpose is to "blanket in darkness", not to generate plot material of its own.

I'm using some of my own ideas, and a few great ideas suggested above by other people, but most of the session was just the PCs interacting with each other in pairs. (It'll be really interesting the next time they're all on screen together, I suspect...)<br/><br/><b><i>Monsterhearts, Part Two</i></b><br/><br/>'Pervy Pete' gives Cassius a burnt CD (labeled "Cashews"), while saying, "Do you know who you are? Do you know what you are?" The disk has a single file on it: video footage of the school hallway where Cassius had his conversation with Cordelia Cooper. However, the footage looks very creepy because Cassius can't be seen on the videotape. (How in the world did he get a camera there? Pervy Pete seems to be able to get into all kinds of places somehow.) Cassius heads over to Lilith's house to watch the disk, since he doesn't have a working computer at home.<br/><br/>Next, I initiate a flashback: "When was the last time Lilith and Flinch saw each other?" <br/><br/>Lilith arrives back at school for the first time, after spending several months away in order to deal with her emotional breakdown after Flinch dumped and humiliated her (we don't know how just yet, maybe good fodder for another flashback later). It's cold and raining, dark, as Lilith arrives at the school. A good portion of the girls' lacrosse team rushes by her, knocking her down on the stairs. ("Hey, bimbo! Way to wear white in the rain, loser!") Her glasses fall off, and while she's scrambling to pick them up, Cordelia kicks them out of the way.<br/><br/>Flinch is walking his three younger siblings to school in the meantime. His youngest sister, Twitch, recognizes Lilith ("Isn't that your friend, Flinch? I like her!"). Flinch makes sure she's not watching, then walks over to Lilith, who's still looking around for her glasses but can't find them. He steps on them, breaking the glass, then forcefully pushes them into her hand, cutting her skin. (We decide to roll for "lash out physically" here, which works out perfectly: Flinch does her harm and gains a String on her, but because he rolled a 7-9, or mixed result, she also gains a String on him, representing the pity and tenderness he feels for her but is trying not to show. Since this is a flashback, we narrate how the cut from the glass leaves a scar on her hand.)<br/><br/>Cordelia laughs and says, "Welcome back to school, Lisa!" (Cordelia never gets Lilith's name right.)<br/><br/>Back in the present:<br/><br/>Flinch confronts 'Pervy Pete' telling him that, yes, their plans are still on for tonight, but from now on at school they don't talk to each other, they don't know each other, got it? Pete agrees to this, although he seems convinced that no one will ever catch on.<br/><br/>Flinch goes to his locker and finds two items inside. First, a scrap of newspaper on which someone has written in charcoal: "Did you watch them yet?" Second, an invitation from Cordelia to her after-game party that night. (However, as we later discover, for some reason she's invited Cassius to come over for 9:30, and Lilith to come over for 10:00, but Flinch's invitation says 10:30.)<br/><br/>Flinch sets out to find Cassius (whom he has a habit of stalking), but only finds Cassius's mom at home, drinking gin alone at the kitchen table, in tears.<br/><br/>Meanwhile: <br/><br/>Lilith is staring at her closet (the source of her childhood fears) through her bedroom mirror and loses herself in reverie ("gaze into the abyss"). She has a brief vision of something scratching at the inside of the Buick's trunk, as though trying to get out, and then a second vision of 'Pervy Pete' watching an old television screen which shows Mrs. Lloyd, whose face is quickly washed out by powerful rain. The vision ends when she feels a hand on her shoulder: somehow, Cassius is here in the room with her, and he demands to know what's going on. (The viewers note, rather ominously, that we can't see his reflection in the mirror.)<br/><br/>They bicker, and Lilith reveals she was "just thinking about her car". Cassius spends a String to manipulate Lilith into telling him why she keeps that old Buick. Tempted by the experience the String offers, Lilith reveals that it's because it reminds her of Flinch (they had some history with that car, and the dents on the trunk were made by Flinch in a fit of anger during a fight they had, which, despite how screwed up that is, is clearly a memory Lilith wants to cling to out of a sense of romantic nostalgia).<br/><br/>Lilith now tries to distract Cassius by turning him on, but he denies her sexually (the Vampire's sex move), and sends her downstairs to "make him a sandwich". While she's gone, he slips Pervy Pete's weird disk into her computer and plays the video, while Lilith watches him through her bedroom door's keyhole.<br/><br/>This is interrupted by a knock at the door. It's Mrs. Cooper (Cordelia's mother, and the Mayor's trophy wife), who is here to deliver Lilith some disturbing news. (When Lilith runs downstairs to meet her, Cassius realizes Lilith was at the door to her bedroom this whole time, spying on him.) <br/><br/>Mrs. Cooper is carrying a white box and an invitation to Cordelia's party. At the same time, Lilith's father, Ted, comes home from work. Mrs. Cooper seems keen to meet him, but Cassius manipulates her to leave with him, telling her he knows how her red convertible got those dents in it last weekend...<br/><br/>Lilith distracts her father from the box by telling him it's "girl stuff" (and, when he presses further, says there are sex toys in there). The father doesn't push any further with that, but turns red and starts watching football in the living room.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Cassius ends up at the Coopers's house. Mrs. Cooper invites him in (which is a String for the Vampire, due to the Invited move) and they make a deal: he'll keep an eye on Cordelia, and find out what she's up to, and Mrs. Cooper will "make it worth his while". She begins by writing him a $100 cheque. (It will be interesting to see what he does with the money...)<br/><br/>Back at Lilith's house: Lilith goes upstairs and finds Pervy Pete's disk ("Cashews") in the garbage can. She plays the video on it, and then finally looks in the white box Mrs. Cooper brought her. It contains the dessicated corpse of her favourite pet: "Lefty", the three-legged rabbit that Flinch had rescued and given to her during their courtship. Cassius didn't leave a single drop of blood in the poor beast.<br/><br/>Seeing her favourite pet's bloodied fur, Lilith faints onto her bed. Flinch, who is watching all this from the outside, tears open the window (breaking the lock) and jumps into the room. He climbs on top of her, shaking her awake. Flinch and Lilith yell at each other both confused and angry, until Flinch starts to get distracted by Lilith's unbuttoned blouse (she rolls to turn him on, and gets a 7-9).<br/><br/>Flinch promises Lilith something he thinks she wants: that he will find out who did this to her Lefty, and fix this whole situation for her. Then he jumps out the window, leaving Lilith alone with her father, who storms in, concerned for her safety. <br/><br/>Her father demands to know what's going on, and she doesn't want to tell him anything. He pushes her, saying how, now that she's not going for therapy sessions with Mrs. Lloyd anymore, and her mother is far away (we established she lives in the Big City), they have only each other and need to share everything they can in order to make it through. These two have a bit of a shouting match, leaving both of them a little disturbed.

She will be racking up experience and gaining new moves, until she grows a backbone and turns everyone into her bitch! We saw a bit of her cold side in her interactions with her dad... it probably won't be too long until the poor girl comes into her own as this story progresses. And when that happens... watch out!<br/><br/>Meanwhile, it sounds like Cassius has some big plans (something involving her "unstable" Condition)...<br/><br/>(I'll be back with some observations on how things went in terms of gameplay and player interactions. Any thoughts or suggestions on fun things to do from here as the MC are more than welcome!

They were excited about the concept, but totally uncertain about the process of play. Since they were somewhat cagey, I decided to just pull out the playset ("It All Ends in Tears"), and we started creating Elements. They got excited by that right away, and once we were done I pulled out the playbooks, which they felt a little more intimidated by, but by now they were hooked.<br/><br/>I made a conscious decision to lead by example, but not to explain rules or limitations until it became necessary. (For instance, they know that there are basic moves, and how they're triggered but not their details. They know their Strings on one another give them an ability to influence each other, but not the full list of ways how. We figure those things out when they come up -- I use jenskot's <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/17119/monsterhearts-cards/p1" rel="nofollow">Monsterhearts cards</a>, so I can just pass along the appropriate card when a move is made). In particular, I very consciously avoided saying too much about what they can say and what they shouldn't say: instead, I just frame scene and make moves and then ask, "what do you do?", and we take it from there.<br/><br/>To start from the beginning:<br/><br/>The brainstorming was very active and everyone engaged very strongly. Once we started playing out scenes, however, the players got a little timid. Cassius was trying to avoid conflict or difficult situations, Flinch liked to watch things from a distance without interfering in them, and Lilith's player is still a little shy, taking a long time to deliberate on decisions and often taking the "safe" choice whenever possible.<br/><br/>As we played through the scenes of the second session, everyone started getting into the game a lot more actively, and developing confidence about how the game works and how the various tools work. I can see their confidence developing as we go along, and by the end of the session people were starting to spend Strings without my having to prompt them first.<br/><br/>Overall, the players are more comfortable brainstorming together than getting in-character and playing out scenes, but this is quickly changing. The result is that a lot of the scene framing is much more consensual than I've seen in most RPG circles, with players often stepping up to suggest details or actions on behalf of another character, and using "GM powers" in general. For example, when I was about to describe Lilith coming out of her "gaze into the abyss" trance, the player of the Vampire said, "Ooh! And then I'm there, she feels a hand on her shoulder!" This made for a great moment, and we went with it even though in the fiction we had absolutely no justification for the Vampire's presence in her house in that particular scene.<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to seeing how the group dynamics will evolve further. The Mortal is the first to score an advance, and seeing what the player chooses to do with it may be a big hint about where we're headed next.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, I'm wondering whether I need to up the drama (the tension is building, and it could be fun to ramp it up, see some blood and tears - maybe a fight, a demon, or some terrible discovery, a monster appears...) or whether I need to hold back the drama (because, as <a href="/forums/profile/EpistolaryRichard">@EpistolaryRichard</a> points out, the love triangle we've got going has a lot of tension in it, and it might be more fun to draw that out a bit rather than letting everything implode right now).<br/><br/>In any case, my current plan for the next session is to open with the party at Cordelia's house, which is sure to be interesting.<br/><br/>Playing this game has also made me appreciate the "seating chart" more, and I may do some of that. Heck, maybe I'll make a "seating chart" for a formal dinner at Cordelia's party! She's filthy rich, maybe she's into Murder Mystery Dinner Theatre, or just paid for some catered meal before the debauchery starts.<br/><br/>(Now that I see it on the screen in front of me, though, I'm liking the "Murder Mystery Dinner Theatre" concept more and more...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EpistolaryRichard" title="EpistolaryRichard"><img alt="EpistolaryRichard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EpistolaryRichard">EpistolaryRichard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408780/#Comment_408780" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-11T18:56:02+00:00" title="March 11, 2013  6:56PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran a pick-up one-shot game of Monsterhearts last Saturday which went well.
