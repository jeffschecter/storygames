                    Okay, I recognize that I've been trained into two really bad habits by mainstream play.<br/><br/>One: anything presented in the game text as a mystery of the setting is off limits.  No group I'm in will ever follow up on that mystery.  Why?  Because I've been whipped like a dog by metaplot running roughshod over my plans for a setting.  ("Well, don't use that suppliment" "But I paid for it" "Well, you didn't have to buy it" "Why did they print it then?")  Tell me decisive facts about the setting and I will play to or against them, but leave anything up in the air and I steer well clear.  <br/><br/>The other reason behind this, and it's more justifiable I think, is that if there's a vague point of any kind, then by playing into that void, I might be stepping on someone's toes.  If the setting says that the King has one daughter, and she's missing, and I make the True Princess, what if someone else wanted to be the True Princess?<br/><br/>Which leads to two: I hedge my character concepts.  I'm loath to make decisive statements about my characters for fear that they won't fit into the campaign the GM put together.  No point in being a born in New York, never left New York, never will leave New York cop, if the GM start off with "we're playing in Sydney."  And I've gotten whipped on this one, too.  Had several characters I'd built up and loved cored by a dictum from behind the screen.  So now I build little half ideas into characters, with the hope that the other half will come out of somewhere.<br/><br/>=============================<br/><br/>Now, I've seen games that address my first problem.  Clinton is really clear in TSoY: do whatcha like because I will never contradict you.  He also provides lots of clear facts, and really awesome strong statements about Near, and not much in the way of vague mystery.<br/><br/>My second issue I think is just bad habits left over from weaker GMs.  Some of it's in the "you must write the whole campaign before chargen" mentality - that I think is spawned by "so that we can sell you campaign books" supplement mill model.<br/><br/>What I'd love to hear is how various processes and theory models address all this.  Shared character creation, flags, single book games all come immediately to mind.  Other schools of thought also supplicated.  <br/><br/>And, hell, what bad habits do you have?                </div>

Um?  I think the thematical battery type thing worked well for that.  FLFS definitely led me to two strong, aggressive character concepts (even though one of them was kind of meek, and the other restrained).  But that a had a lot to do with the "discuss your concepts, make batteries" part that SE requires, rather than SE itself.  To be honest, even having seen it done, the SE process is still a little opaque to me.  I could do it, but it doesn't have any effect on my character concepts - as a mechanic I have yet to feel it's strategic weight, kinda.

I'm mostly over this one, because I love to run seat of the pants stuff.  General idea where to take things, pretty good idea of character and player buttons, and go!

Seems a bit odd, I play mostly mainstream games and I've never learnt anything of the kind.  I'm also not sure what you mean by not rewarded, I get rewarded by people having a good time and doing interesting things in game, which has relatively little to do with the rules chosen.<br/><br/>Note, I'm not saying system doesn't matter, I firmly believe it does.  But system isn't where I get my rewards or where I think most people get their rewards, system is a tool to help me along the way.<br/><br/>But then, I find the whole thread odd, I don't think there's any lessons I've learned from the games that were a problem, though plenty I've come up with on my own or learnt from bad GMs.<br/><br/>On the prep point, tons of mainstream games need relatively little prep and a fair few don't have a mission based game structure.  Mainstream gaming is large, it contains multitudes, I get the feeling many people are confusing mainstream games and DnD 3.5 (which also doesn't require a mission based structure actually).                        </div>

Only a subset of games have this issue though, the White Wolf stuff and deadlands leap out at me.  I play mostly mainstream games and nothing I play (and I don't play anything particularly obscure) has untouchable secrets or NPCs.  It's a 1990s publishing model issue more than something intrinsic to the games, and a publishing model that I think has since gone out of favour.<br/><br/>Most mainstream games don't have a metaplot, to put it simply.

I don't see quite what this has to do with the games.  Why not discuss your character concept with the GM in advance?  Again, there is nothing in mainstream gaming that says the GM has to come up with some big campaign in advance and then you try to fit some character created in a vacuum into that.  I mean I know people do play that way, but that's because they are in crappy groups, it's not something intrinsic to the games.                        </div>

Jukka, I had that one for ages ^. Now I'm slowly getting to the point where I can see the value in mechanics. But they better not take more than a few pages, and they better not take too long to learn!                        </div>

                            For a while, I was stuck with the idea that "Real Roleplayers do not use combat. Combat is for Munchkins only." This made things difficult since I was GMing AD&amp;D. I don't think this was from mainstream games per se, but from a lot of reading I did about "how to be a good GM" and "how to be a good roleplayer."<br/><br/>Thankfully, I'm over that. Now I can play Agon and say things like "Hey, Hera wants us to kill the villagers and Athena wants us to kill the monster, and they're <em>not mutually exclusive</em>!

                            Rather than rant about things I neublously learned from those vauge "mainstream" games, I'll point at three actual examples of things that were (for me) really bad explinations of ways and reasons to play. <br/><br/>The first is the Bubblegum Crisis RPG from R. Tal. This anime-liscence game at one point has a section about why the PCs you make with this game will not be nearly as cool as the main characters in the anime. The basic reasons boil down to 1) because being that cool is something you have to earn after a long term of playing, 2) the system doesn't support it easily, and 3) it lets the GM have more control of where the game goes. Even back then I didn't fully buy it, but there were a lot of other games that did that less explicitly and the whole "you have to earn the right to have fun/play the character you want through a year of paying your dues play" is something that did suck up my play for a long time. <br/><br/>Second, the GM advice in the Buffy RPG GM's guide. The main book was pretty decent, as far as I recall, but in the book that came with the GM screen there was a chapter talking about what to do when the players "go off the tracks." The example, IIRC, had to do with what to do if the players want to go to a library to research something that you don't want them/haven't preped for them researching. The suggestions included telling them the library was closed, attacking them on the way to the library, and if they insisted and were so silly as to break into the library to poison them with pesticide because they wouldn't get the hint. At no point was it suggested you just say "you go and find nothing" or even more shocking, "guys, I'm not ready for that, can we try something else instead?" Really, it's like a big lecture on all the bad lessons of Illusionism. <br/><br/>Third was back in the (first edition?) Werewolf LARP from WW. There was a rule in that book that if you still had all your traits at the end of the game, you get an extra XP. The reason? Because if you had all your traits it meant you hadn't used the system to resolove any disputes durring the game (despite the fact it didn't mean that -- it just meant you'd won them all), and the mark of a good RPer is not using the rules, and thus you should be rewarded for it. With a reward from the rules. <br/><br/>Now, what about the good lessons I've learned from Mainstream gaming? Maybe a spinoff is in order.                        </div>

Fair enough, I just thought the premise rather odd, in that most of the examples don't have anything much to do with games mainstream or otherwise but with GMing habits (and crap GMing habits at that) which is a different beast.  I also don't think mainstream games is a meaningful concept, which makes the whole exercise a bit random.  I would struggle equally to say what positive things I had learnt from mainstream games.<br/><br/>The whole thread seems the equivalent of saying "indie games are about taking power from the GM" which I see posted all the time on rpg.net and which says more about the poster than the games and which equally isn't true of most of them.  <br/><br/>But I don't want to threadcrap, so thanks for the comments which I fully take on board and having done so I'll check out.                        </div>

Having just said I'll check out, there is some truly awful GMing advice out there in a lot of books and advice on keeping players on track comes up quite often.  Heroquest had a lot of this, advice on how to browbeat your players into not killing NPCs by techniques that I think would cause many games just to crash and burn.<br/><br/>Interestingly, Over the Edge by the same author had really good GM advice which avoided those kinds of pitfalls.<br/><br/>The other common flaw I see next to truly awful GMing advice, is no real advice at all.  Gurps is very prone to this, a whole book full of stuff and nothing to help you craft a game from it.  By contrast, Dogs tells you how to prep and how to run the game in play, which makes it far easier to use to actually run a game.                        </div>

                            Brand,<br/><br/>I don't own the book anymore, I'm waiting for Mythic Russia for my HQ fix, but I remember a lot of very poor and surprisingly traditional GM advice.<br/><br/>The particular section though was to do with a player who was too violent for the GM's tastes, and included IIRC three different in game ways to deal with what was essentially an out of game problem (which is rarely effective), including allowing the player to do as they wished but then giving them new negative traits without warning to punish them for it which just seemed to me a really passive-aggressive way of dealing with a problem that could far better be addressed by a simple OOC chat about the tone of the game that everyone wanted.<br/><br/>It was simply the example that came to mind though, HQ was surprising partly because for such an innovative game it seemed to have such crufty GM advice.  There are worse candidates out there, I have read far too many games with GM advice which amounted to "here are ways to railroad your players and avoid them having any creative input at all".                        </div>

Often I think from truly awful GM advice actually, thinking about this more.  This is an area, regardless of my earlier comments, where the indie games tend to be far better than the games that have gone before.<br/><br/>Too many GM sections seem to have advice almost tailored to producing subpar games with unhappy players, happily I think most groups learn to ignore that advice but new GMs having nothing else will try to apply it which is where the bad lessons come from.<br/><br/>First thing we do, burn all the GM advice sections.  Too many great games are totally undermined by these.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Balbinus</cite>The whole thread seems the equivalent of saying "indie games are about taking power from the GM" which I see posted all the time on rpg.net and which says more about the poster than the games and which equally isn't true of most of them.<br/></blockquote>
You wound me, sir!  I started the discussion because I'd noticed that I had these two habits: avoiding anything vague in the setting fiction (which came up in another discussion) and hedging my character concepts.<br/><br/>I think of these a habits I got from mainstream games - specifically Deadlands, Palladium et al, Shadowrun and Cyberpunk - because they've been highlighted by my play of certain indie games.  And in thinking about those habits and their origins I trace them back through the behaviors of the GMs and play groups to actual manuals and the behavior of publishers.<br/><br/>Specifically, I trace the one back to metaplots, which were a publishing habit in the 90s.  And you know what?  I did a lot of roleplaying in the 90s.  So when I see a big NPC doing anything cool, I stay out of the way.<br/><br/>I trace the other back to pre-written scenarios, which were accompanied by the implication that the GM should prep the whole campaign and then invite players to make characters.  But that a big part of the fun was in the surprises to come in the scenario, so my GMs tended to be unwilling to discuss the scenario in any depth.  Result: I hedge my PCs so that they'll be able to be made to fit.  (Never mind the demolitions expert cum bad ass amongst Chicago street gangs who got roped into a trip to South America.)                        </div>

<p>Of course you can! I was responding in irritation to the "taking power away from the GM" spiel, which bothers me so deeply because the trad GM relation (the "host/arbiter/opposition/sole holder of social responsibility" one) is like...a scar over a socially wounded situation, and it damages otherwise healthy people. I hate to see it defended.</p>

It's scary how many people internalize this as "The GM must entertain the players."<br/>

                            1) RPG books are to be read stochastically.<br/>

2) Character death is to be avoided <br/>

3) My (sole) job as the GM is to ensure that the players have fun. This is also my (first) job as a player. <br/>
<br/>
4) Tinkering should happen during play, and often. <br/>
<br/>
As far as GM advice, the two biggest pieces I internalized were the Planescape DM section - which discussed more on how the game should feel than what it should do and the Diehard rule from 7th sea - "Player's what you to beat their characters to an inch of their lives. And then they want to win." Not sure whether these are truly bad, or just incomplete. <br/>
<br/>
Although I must say I had already derived an approach by the time I read them. That being that play is a series of choices, all of which should be fun/interesting, even though the outcomes may be very different. Give players opportunities to do fun things, not obstacles to be overcome for the fun. I suppose that came from the D&amp;D Cyclopedia and Spelljammer, but I really don't know how. Perhaps the system creation rules in Spelljammer were at fault. <br/>

Nope, D&amp;F is totally GMless. Drowning Master and Falling Master were artifacts from an early draft of the game. I have found that with a group of new folks, it helps if there's a shepherd to poke folks when it's their turn to do something.                        </div>

In the original post, I thought I'd play with putting a &lt;hr /&gt; tag in to separate my motivation from the thesis.  My guess is that Vanilla is now trying to close the &lt;hr /&gt; tag, and as a result is adding bars all through the discussion.

So when the Dragonlance modules said "the characters will take the left path and if they don't, punish them until they do", I just did it, I didn't think that the game meant it as any kind of advice for what makes a good game.

In a parallel vein:<br/><br/>Everybody is running around with personal selections from a vast array of weapons.  Some folks prefer swords, some like smashy maces, others like big long polearms.  Some folks wear lots of armor, some don't.  People's choice of weapon is completely detached from the weapons and armor of their opponents, and all weapons work more-or-less the same in any combat, regardless of the circumstances in which the combat takes place.<br/><br/>I don't know how many teenaged games I had guys with rapiers and big hats fighting guys in plate armor swinging broadswords.                        </div>

                            On Heroquest, Max is correct about said section. But a couple of caveats. First, Robin Laws wrote Hero Wars, and material from that was lifted from it for Hero Quest. He may have rewritten some for it, too, I'm not sure. But look at the authors list for HQ, and you'll see several names there. So any incongruity between Mr. Laws work in other games and in HQ should probably be put down to somebody else having put those words in. <br/><br/>If that stuff is in HW as well (it might be), I think that this edition, too, had multiple authors. <br/><br/>Somebody who can correct me on this should, if it turns out that Laws wrote that section. For the record, as well, I'm not even sure that Laws wrote that part of OTE...though that I could believe. He wasn't the primary author in that case. But he did give great advice in the sections credited to him. <br/><br/>HQ goes back and forth between a set of coherent advice that sometimes approaches DitV in terms of effectiveness, and then lots of other material that directly contradicts the good stuff. <br/><br/>What's interesting about the bad advice in this specific case (how to avoid apparent character sociopathy brought on by players who aren't really playing HQ), is that it at times gets close to being good advice. That is, rather than black that section out, I read it a tad differently than most. What I see is "inform the player that you as another participant in the game is a significant act, by calling for a contest for the character to accomplish it." That way you get to see what abilities exist (or do not exist), on the character sheet that make him the killer that he is.<br/><br/>Generally speaking, I completely agree that using in-game hammers to smack down problems with players not playing by the rules are bound to fail. But in this case, I think what we're talking about is an agenda difference, and, in that case, I think that mechanics are precisely the thing to bring everybody onto the same sheet of music, if it's going to happen at all. <br/><br/>From that POV, maybe Laws did write it. Yeah, the text in question smacks of, "In playtesting I had a player who saw HQ's lack of limitations on character behavior as an excuse to be an asshat, so I've included suggestions on how to fix that." If that's what it really is, then, yeah, it's wrong, wrong, wrong. But if it's really more about traditional players not getting the paradigm of play, and how to get them to understand it, then I can forgive it. <br/><br/>HQ's challenge was that it supported a new paradigm, but still wanted to be able to cater to the RQ players. Not an easy task. So, if it's confused, this is why. <br/><br/><br/>But, generally I think we all agree that any advice that has to do with punishing a player in-game to get them to "play right" is seriously misguided. As a general principle, I think this covers half of the lessons listed above. <br/><br/>I'm going to go out on a limb to figure out why such text is common. I think that a game designer looking at his design will think, "Gee, remember that asshat Ted? What if the GM running this game has an asshat like that in his game? What advice can I give the GM to deal with this? Ah, I know, the GM can punish the player by not giving EXP." And the designer does this even though it's not what he did with Ted. Ted was expelled from the game. Or the game collapsed because of Ted. Or the GM worked it out with Ted on a social level, taking him aside and talking it out. <br/><br/>Because what did not happen is that the Designer/GM here punished Ted in-game, and it actually made Ted play right. But the Designer not knowing how to say how to deal with this outside of in-game consequences, resorts to what he feels he can write into the game. <br/><br/>Oh, actually many games have suggestions about "taking the player aside and talking to him" as well. The problem is that the designer in this case is incorrectly identifying the problem behavior as protected. That is, the player is considered the sole authority on the character, so you're not allowed to give them feedback on what they should have the character do - that would be considered playing their character for them. As such, the player isn't considered to be out of line, so you can't correct the behavior on a social level. So you have to correct it on a in-game level is the assumption. So the "Taking the player aside" text refers only to "OOC" behavior. <br/><br/>To say nothing of the fact that "taking the player aside" is indicative of punitive measures (else why do you have to keep it private), instead of simply working out play together. But that's a whole 'nother discussion. <br/><br/>Mike                        </div>

                            Hi!<br/>
  The number one thing I learned from Bad MAinstream games is:<br/>
Examples of play are meaningless, confusing and contradictory.<br/>
  I'd only go to the example if the rule had some point that was not clear and the example would not help in any way about half of the time, so I stopped reading them, lol<br/>

                            Mike,<br/><br/>You reminded me of the bad lesson I learned as an aspiring game designer years and years ago: qualify every statement.  Including your qualifications.  Because as the Designer, you're God, and they will Follow you Text to the Letter.  So if you get it wrong, they will play a Bad Game, so whatever you do <em>don't</em> write clear assertions of anything.  There should always be an "unless," "but," or "sometimes" tagging along after every suggestion you make about how the game should be played.                        </div>

                            I now unveil my first-ever post on Story Games to say. . .<br/>
<br/>
*ahem*<br/>
<br/>
I'm pretty sure Robin Laws didn't write the OtE text in question.<br/>
<br/>
at least if we're talking about the same text. The essay "The Literary Edge" is attributed to Robin, kind of as a "guest columnist." The whole general GM advice section is all Jonathan Tweet, methinks.<br/>
<br/>
And anyway, I'm don't think it's that great. I'm thinking particularly of the section, "How to Hose the Player-characters." OK, so it's not as bald-facedly punitive as the offending HQ example. But that seems to be its point--be so sly in punishing for playing wrong that the don't even realize that's what's happening. And like Mike is pointing out about the HQ text, it does seem to be ALMOST good advice. It's mainly about dealing with asshattery, particularly of the "my guy's invincible" type that plagues GMs. And the solution of letting them feel the consequences of their own actions is a good one, at its core. But the way it's laid out, it's really a thinly veiled excuse for the Mighty GM Hammer. It's not "Here's some consequences, now you have to deal with that." it's more like "Here's some consequences, and now you are SCREWED."<br/>
<br/>
Mind you, I ate it up at the time. I lovingly read it to my more trusted players, chortling about how this system would put those "powergamers" in their place. (Incidentally, it didn't, they walked all over me, but then, I never really pulled out the Hammer.) But now, I look back on it and. . .well, dammit, it's just so passive-aggressive. As I write this, I'm not so sure the problem is in the screwed-ness; the severity of the consequences are variable and don't have to be an all-out pooch-screw. No, it's more the tone; it's not putting the problem out in the open, it's hiding behind a GM's screen and acting like it's not you making that pooch-screw happen. It'd be much better to just throw out the clusterfuck the PCs have earned, smile and say "hey, you asked for it. . ." Hell, it doesn't even have to be a bad thing; for all it's "Oh shit!" factor, it can be a springboard for cool situation, rather than a punishment.<br/>
<br/>
Damn, I sure went on, eh? I gues we've found one of MY bad lessons learned: THe GM-Player relationship is adversarial, because they outnumber you and will walk all over you.<br/>
<br/>
So,uh, there,I'm even on topic. :)<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

                            I learned that I don't like dice and they get in the way of fun.  Which they do when they're used for stuff I don't enjoy.  But now I know they can be fun too.<br/>
<br/>
I learned that doing the sorts of things I like to do breaks the game, destroys the fun for everyone else and makes life difficult for the GM.  It's nice to be wrong on this one.<br/>
