We have room for about 30 players, and the venue is an easy commuter rail ride (plus a short walk) away from NYC.<br/><br/>The larp we're running, Playing the Cards, is a script from the new anthology of Norwegian larpscripts that I'm helping edit. The hard copy is due out in late October.<br/><br/>Sign-up for the NJ event here!<br/><a href="http://highlandparkplayers.wordpress.com/2013/09/11/october-gamefest/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://highlandparkplayers.wordpress.com/2013/09/11/october-gamefest/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
