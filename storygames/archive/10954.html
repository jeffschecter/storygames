What distinguishes Dune from, say, the Lord of the Rings, is the high-end political conflict that functions as backdrop for the actions of the characters. You need to be able to run scenes between the Baron Harkonnen and the Emperor. At the same time you need to be able to run scenes involving Leto Atreides and his chief vassals in their struggles to outwit the Baron\u2019s machinations. Moreover, the main characters shift midway through the book when Leto is assassinated and his vassals are all suddenly made into marginal figures for a new drama involving Paul Atreides, his mother and various Fremen. <br/><br/>One easy solution would be for the Producer to intersperse the players\u2019 scenes with an occasional cutscene depicting key political developments. But I\u2019d prefer a more open-ended game, one where large-scale events depend on player choices, not GM fiat. <br/><br/>How might this be done? What would happen if players were each given a noble house to represent in the high-stakes political arena, in addition to a character within the Atreides House (or, later, the Fremen rebel group)?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_243037">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243037/#Comment_243037" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-21T12:54:38+00:00" title="November 21, 2009 12:54PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why Primetime Adventures?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_243041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pete" title="Pete"><img alt="Pete" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pete">Pete</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243041/#Comment_243041" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-21T13:09:56+00:00" title="November 21, 2009  1:09PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.burningempires.com/" rel="nofollow">Burning Empires</a> seems like a fine fit for the micro/macro scales you mention.

Certainly the game appears to have been crafted on a Dune-like model. But I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready for Burning Wheel levels of crunchiness. Though I should add that my only experience with Burning Wheel to date is Mouse Guard.<br/><br/>I\u2019m more of a rules-light, player-driven sort of guy. Hence the attraction of Primetime Adv, or possibly Capes. <br/><br/>Capes has the curious advantage of divorcing the usually indissoluble bond between player and player character. Run using the Capes engine, players could generate a large # of key characters, then play through scenes using that game\u2019s meta-currency to keep a sense of balance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_243044">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243044/#Comment_243044" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-21T13:55:04+00:00" title="November 21, 2009  1:55PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chuck,<br/><br/>If you do have some experience with the Burning Wheel games, there is a Burning Wheel supplement designed to play Dune called <a href="http://www.burningwheel.org/wiki/index.php?title=Downloads#Burning_Sands:_Jihad" rel="nofollow">Jihad</a>.

From what I can gather in reading Jono DiCarlo\u2019s <a>review</a> on RPGNet, Shock sets individuals in conflict with large-scale organizations. I\u2019m interested here in (1) struggle between large-scale orgs that\u2019s carried out through a series of (2) conflicts between individuals banded together in teams.<br/><br/>But I\u2019d love to hear more, if you think that Shock can be run along these lines.

One possible problem with vanilla PTA and perhaps with Shock is that the goals on the table are relatively loose fictional stakes. We can decide that a possible fictional event is "The Engineer Uprising deposes the Civil Government". But does story-logic/social-contract determine what kinds of fictional stakes are valid (is someone the arbiter of whether that uprising is feasible?); or do you want more of a system for comparing the Civil Government's power of 6 and the Engineer's combustability of 3 etc?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_243229">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chuck%20Henebry" title="Chuck Henebry"><img alt="Chuck Henebry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chuck%20Henebry">Chuck Henebry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243229/#Comment_243229" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-23T05:50:49+00:00" title="November 23, 2009  5:50AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dev, that\u2019s exactly right.

Alternatively, the outcome might be described verbally but coupled with a bonus or penalty to give it teeth.

That's a 1.0 phenomenon, and it really doesn't seem to add to the game, so it's out. It's all about the serial episodes now for long-term play.</p>\n<p>Simon, Praxes are The Way Stuff Gets Done In This Universe. They can change from episode to episode if you like, but they're a front-loaded thematic statement, so they have a huge impact on what can happen. They give you a way to define characters by the way they act.</p>\n<p>Other Praxis configurations I'd consider for Dune (depending on the episode in question):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Manpower vs. Desert Power</li>\n<li>Loyalty vs. Love (This is a good one! Consider Yueh vs. Leto I or Chani vs. Irulan. Boy, I'd like to see a story about Chani and Irulan. The women sure get short shrift, don't they? "History will consider us wives" my ass.)</li>\n<li>Strike from the shadows vs. Face my enemy</li>\n<li>Power of my Self vs. Power of my People</li>\n<li>Demagoguery vs. Intimacy</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This kinda makes me want to do it.

Stringing short-term Story Goals makes them build on each other. Having a single, overarching objective from the beginning means that it probably just won't mean that much by the end because things will have gone an unexpected direction.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_243370">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chuck%20Henebry" title="Chuck Henebry"><img alt="Chuck Henebry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chuck%20Henebry">Chuck Henebry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243370/#Comment_243370" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-24T05:39:52+00:00" title="November 24, 2009  5:39AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This sounds like fun, Josh.
