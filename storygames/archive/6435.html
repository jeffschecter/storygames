I'm sorry but this is a very open question. I'm just trying to get some open guidance at this stage. Specifics will follow later:<br/><br/>I'm working on a home brew game, not to publish, but becaue its what I want to run after the current campaign ends and there doesn't appear to be a published system which quite fits the bill. Primetime Adventures comes closest. Best Friends also has quite a few ideas which work.<br/><br/>The game to a large extent inspired by the recent rather short lived TV series <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0770521/l" rel="nofollow">Drive</a>. It might also take some inspiration from films like 'It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World' (1963), 'Cannonball Run' (1981) or 'Cars' (2006), but the main inspiration is definately Drive. <br/><br/>The backdrop is an illegal cross-country road race, but actually winning the race should be irrelevant. Ideally the system should work just as well for a boat race, or a spaceship race. Any race in mutiple legs could serve as a melting pot in which to explore a group of characters.<br/><br/>Each character needs to have his own reason for being in the race (his Reason), and a driving force in his life (his Obsession). These need be tied in some way. For example one characters 'obsession' might be his love for his wife, and his 'reason' for being in the race might be to finance an operation which might save her life. Sometimes they might almost be the same. Another characters obsession might be 'to do something exciting before he dies' and he might be in the race 'because he's only got weeks to live and wants to go out with a bang'. Together they should tell a story. This is the very first thing I want on the sheet because I want it to be the thing everything else is built around. I want to explore the characters 'obsessions' - not the race. I want to see how these characters interact under pressure, and the true goal of the game is coming to some sort of closure with regards each character's obsession.<br/><br/>My initial thoughts were stage the game as a series of legs, and try to cover one leg per gaming session. I was going to allow the players to frame the scenes during the race, but finish each session with a scene at the stop point framed by the GM. I'd like to allow each player to frame a single scene during the each leg of the race, however I'm trying to come up with strong mechanics which encourage them to frame the right sort of scene.<br/><br/>I'd like to find a way of encouraging them to frame scenes with some sort of conflict. Ideally I'd like them to mix up social conflict with actual race conflict with the emphasis on social conflict, and where possible keep actual violence to a minimum. I'd like to also encourage them to bring other players obsessions into play as much as possible.<br/><br/>One of my players suggested awarding race points based on the scenes framed (so you actually get points for framing scenes involving other people obsession), and use these points to work out the order the players come in at the end of that leg. I like this idea, but also feel that to balance things it should also be possible to earn points within scenes by some method. Earning points be framing a scene should be a given. Earning points within a scene should be difficult but if managed should earn more points than framing the scene did. Also I'm thinking of limiting who a player can write into a scene so they cannot write themselves into a scene they frame. One implication of this is that the players will only all meet up at the end of leg scene.<br/><br/>I'm thinking about letting the players introduce each other and then stealing an idea from Best Friends and letting the players define each others characters in terms of five stats, by saying whom they dislike for being more xxx than they are. I was thinking of Clever, Macho, Streetsmart, Subtle and Rich.<br/><br/>I was also thinking of stating vehicles in a similar way. I need to find a way of mixing things up so people occassionally change vehicles. The genre TV series and the cannonball/gumshoe movies found ways of doing this - and the reason is obvious. You need to do this if you want to explore different character dynamics. I haven't quite figured this one out yet.<br/><br/>Could I run it GMless? Well I'd like to aspire to GMless, but I think it might be a lot easier to design with a GM in mind. If I can find a way to do away with the GM altogether later on, all the better, but for the moment I'll keep the GM in.<br/><br/>So where is this leading? Well I am really hoping that people reading this with actual game writing experience might see a) places where I'm going to run into problems and b) places I can improve on what I'm thinking. Any suggestions at this early stage might save me a lot of time later on.<br/><br/>Thanks in advance,<br/><br/>R00kie                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142600">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142600/#Comment_142600" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-06T05:50:34+00:00" title="May  6, 2008  5:50AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds great so far.  I was just thinking about <a href="http://thouandone.wordpress.com/2008/05/04/car-chase-stories-part-1/" rel="nofollow">how to handle car chases in a story-focused way</a>, instead of them being competitive, so I'm really interested in where you're going with this.  It seems like you're pretty clear on where you're going and what your goals are, so maybe it's time to put a really rough outline together, maybe even try to play some of it with just the basic mechanics in place?  That always helps me, playing something as early as I can, even if it's barely held together with duct tape.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_142602">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Blue" title="Blue"><img alt="Blue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Blue">Blue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142602/#Comment_142602" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-06T05:58:44+00:00" title="May  6, 2008  5:58AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Declan -<br/><br/>My two cents.<br/><br/>I've toyed at various points with games with similar inspiration. They've not gone much beyond the intial notes making stage, but I've decided if I go back to them, I want to use a mechanic either based directly on, or at least heavily inspired by, the card game <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mille_Bornes" rel="nofollow">Milles Bourne</a>.<br/><br/>I don't have any other thoughts on your general questions, but it feels like you are heading down a productive road.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142619">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/R00kie" title="R00kie"><img alt="R00kie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/R00kie">R00kie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142619/#Comment_142619" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-06T08:02:43+00:00" title="May  6, 2008  8:02AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've never encountered Milles Bourne before, but I've just had a look.<br/><br/>I can't help feeling that using Milles Bourne as a base mechanic is going to throw the spotlight firmly onto the racing, and away from the character interaction. Having said that the game looks a lot of fun so I've put in a bid for a copy on ebay. I might even win :-)<br/><br/>Also as suggested I'm going to put a rough outline together. There's a bank holiday at the end of the month in England. I'm going to try and get something playtestable together by then, and invite my usual players. I'll even thrown in a barbeque and some wine to encourage them. I doubt it will be much of a game yet, but I'm sure I can get something playable together in three weeks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143012">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/R00kie" title="R00kie"><img alt="R00kie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/R00kie">R00kie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143012/#Comment_143012" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-08T04:29:59+00:00" title="May  8, 2008  4:29AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 8, 2008 4:32AM by R00kie.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>It seems like you're pretty clear on where you're going and what your goals are, so maybe it's time to put a really rough outline together, maybe even try to play some of it with just the basic mechanics in place?
