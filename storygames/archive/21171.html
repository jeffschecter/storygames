I've got a system suit for a power fantasy game where mechanically everything is equivalent: a character quite proficient with a knife can make as much damage as one using spells in the sense that both can one-shot an enemy. (It pursues story simulation more than real world simulation, there's not so much need of game mastery in terms of mechanics. It's meant to be quick to learn.)<br/><br/>So where's the point of choosing one skill or special ability over another in this game? well, it's more about when and how you apply it. No tags, no moves, players just describe what they do and fiction gets negotiated from there somewhat in freeform. But to make this negotiation actually interesting, it's for the best if skills have descriptions with narrative mechanics the players can twist, bend and mix, with the dice as the ultimate ruler of how things come to happen.<br/><br/>For example, if you use elemental magic, you can cast magic of any element but it will be kind of weak, unless you specialize. If you do, it will be harder for you to cast the opposite element, like a fire mage trying to cast water/ice spells.<br/><br/>We could do the same with ordinary skills. For example, weapons with a longer reach will give you advantage against opponents armed with short weapons, unless you're fighting in a cramped space. Flesh can be cut but bone must be crushed. And so on.<br/><br/>You could mix both of these and have a better chance to repel a fire skeleton armed with a glaive if you make it follow you into a narrow corridor where you've got your advantage, even with your fire dagger. The system has a way to quantify these negotiated advantages in a simple way, which is more than enough for story simulation purposes.<br/><br/>Does it sound too bad or strange? right now I've barely got a list of natural and supernatural skills for the game, so I'm trying to find out if there's any easily predictable problem that seems to arise from this concept before I go into all the work of adding narrative mechanics to each one. Have you seen or tried a game that totally failed at this using this or similar mechanics?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463971">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463971/#Comment_463971" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-14T18:03:00+00:00" title="June 14, 2017  6:03PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 14, 2017 6:05PM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited June 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Do I understand this correctly:<br/><b>1)</b> Two characters are in conflict, and the players choose their appropriate abilities. They choose "Fire Magic" and "Knife Fighting", and those are close enough to applicable. Both will basically roll their abilities, and whoever rolls better wins.<br/><b>2)</b> But, the fight occurs in close quarters at a tavern, and we know that magic takes just a little bit of time and space to set up most effectively, so it's pretty clear that the knife fighter has the advantage here. Because their ability is a better fit for the situation, the player in question gets a +6 or whatever to their roll.<br/><b>3)</b> As an added bonus, let's say that one of the fighters has two abilities that sort of could fit for the situation. Perhaps they get to use one to support the other, so as to benefit a little from both instead of one going to waste. Solves a lot of character optimization pitfalls to arrange for something like this.<br/><br/>If the above is roughly what you have in mind, then you've just described <i>Heroquest</i>. It works well [grin]. More generally, it's a part (and progenitor) of a big lot of similar games that have universal conflict mechanics, free-wheeling character attributes and various ways of mixing quantified stats with qualitative fictional situations. Individual games are their own special cases, but in general I'd say that it's a functional and fun approach rules arrangement. Fate is a popular example of the genre.<br/><br/>Also, a general observation: this depends on the particulars of the game, but it's often proven unnecessary for the game designer to provide nitpicky lists of advantageous conditions for different abilities. You could just as easily do as Heroquest does and say that when two abilities are put against each other in conflict, the one that fits the situation better gets the mechanical advantage. The players are well capable of determining who should get this advantage and when without having big lists of "crushing weapons defeat skeletons, skeletons defeat mortal men" rock-paper-scissors stuff spelled out for them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463974">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463974/#Comment_463974" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-14T18:25:10+00:00" title="June 14, 2017  6:25PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How is this "no tags"?

(Particularly if those options reflect the themes of the game!) For example, I can see colourful lists of options of choices, like:\n<blockquote><br/>*Fire Magic*<br/><br/>Choose one feature: <br/>* Your effects are large-scale<br/>* Magical flames can't be put out by normal means (e.g. water, lack of oxygen)<br/>* The flames, once started, remain under your control, instead of spreading<br/><br/>And choose one limitation:<br/>* Using your magic is time-consuming and requires extreme concentration<br/>* You can only use these powers on men or women (choose), the other sex is unaffected<br/>* You must have a source of flame present to work your magic<br/></blockquote>\nYou might look at games which have "generic" powers but still offer some way to limit or define them. For example, <i>In a Wicked Age...</i> allows you to choose whether your Particular Strength is unique, consequential, broad, far-reaching, or potent.<br/><br/>Each has a mechanical or fictional meaning to it - for example, potent means you roll a bigger die, whereas consequential means that whoever you use it on loses a die from one of their forms.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463980">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463980/#Comment_463980" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-14T21:15:52+00:00" title="June 14, 2017  9:15PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting Eero! I'm checking some web info about Heroquest right now. Funny thing that I heard the title before, readed some other stuff from Robin Laws but naver came to realize it was this close to what I've been looking for for years.<br/><br/>Airk, you're right, this started from Aspects, though I'd like something between a Move and an Aspect in complexity, something that doesn't include game mechanics at all if possible. I was thinking maybe 3-5 things you could say about the ability that either give it narrative limitations or exploitable advantages.<br/><br/>I'd prefer it to be longer than a Keyword or the phrase used for an aspect, but there are still a few things in the game that could be easily defined just with one word. I'll keep the longer descriptions just for the special skills and maybe a couple more. It's also because defining abilities in this way helps give the game an atmosphere, in a similar was as PbtA moves define a particular game atmosphere. These still kinda feel a bit limited to me.<br/><br/>While playtesting previous versions of this game, something I wasn't too fond of was the possibility of the player having abilities that encompassed too many things. Yes, you can ask players to change those but there are still too many small ways to exploit this game feature by dumping all the xp into few aspects. I finally came up with a fix where players pair an Approach with a Skill and/or Item bonuses, rather than with an attribute, which works better for this story sim (this is hyper-asian fantasy, Tenra Bansho-like)<br/><br/>Approaches here are more related to what the GM identifies the challenge to be about. <br/><br/>Does it has anything to do with the character inflicting damage directly or indirectly, right now or in the close future? Then it's an <i>Attack</i>.<br/>Is it related to protecting yourself or others from unavoidable harm? then it's <i>Defense.</i><br/>Does it involve moving from A to B to gain a positional advantage or dodging an immediate danger? Then it's <i>Movement</i>.<br/>Is it involved with doing something to avoid facing a problem directly? then it's <i>Subterfuge</i><br/>Is it about regaining resources quickly, like health? then it's <i>Recover</i><br/>Is it about obtaining information from the surroundings or PCs? Then it's <i>Perception</i><br/>Does it involve recalling or finding information your character possesses? Then it's <i>Knowledge</i><br/><br/>Social skills fall into these approaches too, so no need of a separate approach for them.<br/><br/>This became my answer to the problem of having the same skill solving many different problems: now that's a feature that doesn't unbalance the game and instead gives the players the chance to make different builds easily. You can make a healing tank but give it monk-like skills instead of playing a paladin or go through some convoluted multi-classing rules to get that flavor. You can give it better bonuses at <i>subterfuge</i> for a ninja, <i>recover</i> for a self-regenerating relentless warrior, run your combat style around grappling or ki related powers, etc. You could write "spirit-hand techniques" on your character sheet and use that skill with both <i>Attack</i> to rip the soul of your enemies apart or with <i>Recover</i> to turn it into healing energy. Add it the caveat that when using "spirit-hand technique" in this way there's a chance that part of the memories or personality of the soul's owner pass on to whoever gets healed with it. That's what I'm heading for.<br/><br/>Btw, I read about this in other thread -Its strange that when reading, you can perfectly see the tags and work with them, but as soon as you try using them mechanically in a conversation they actually bog down a bit the otherwise fluid descriptions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463982">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463982/#Comment_463982" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-14T21:40:11+00:00" title="June 14, 2017  9:40PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you played any games which do freeform traits?<br/><br/>You should definitely look at Heroquest, Dogs in the Vineyard, and the Pool, for instance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463983">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463983/#Comment_463983" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-14T21:47:07+00:00" title="June 14, 2017  9:47PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 14, 2017 9:49PM by WarriorMonk.">edited June 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cross-posted:<br/><br/>Paul, exactly, I'm not really reinventing the wheel, this comes from several hacks from the usual stuff: Fate, PbtA, The Mountain witch, also Tenra Bansho, and so much other stuff I'm losing the count. <br/><br/>The negotiation is as simple as dealing poker chips to the players when they state an advantage the GM can't counter with a disadvantage established by the fiction. Players can also take a disadvantage, which uses a different color chip. Each of these chips can be discarded to add an additional skill or item bonus to the roll. All players can participate in the negotiation, up to 3 chips in total. When not exchanged for a skill, chips have a low fixed value. Disadvantage chips are not discarded when exchanged for a skill and always count as a fixed penalty to the roll. <br/><br/>This mechanic still needs testing, hopefully the actual chips won't be needed and everything can be solved more quickly through the description and subsequent discussion.<br/><br/>Your Fire Magic description looks more or less like what I'm looking for. I'm not sure about going for the "choose your own features and limitations"; it's actually really cool but I'd probably end up adding perhaps too many options on those lists instead of focusing on a single one and get it good <img alt=":pensive:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/pensive.png" title=":pensive:"/> . <br/><br/>About games with freeform traits, I've mostly tried a few hacks of those with my group. I mainly ended up doing this because of how things turned up on those games. I'd probably try them in their original form as intended, though that would be hard to do with my group right now, due to our schedule. I should check if I can try it online, it could give me a better light on the whole subject.<br/><br/>Is there any PbtA game that uses freeform traits instead of custom moves out there that I'm missing?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463987/#Comment_463987" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-14T22:13:38+00:00" title="June 14, 2017 10:13PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 14, 2017 10:13PM by Paul_T.">edited June 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The "chips" system actually sounds pretty interesting; it's got a fun "gamey" quality to it which can made to work really well with freeform traits.<br/><br/>I don't think PbtA is all that well-suited to freeform traits, but I have nevertheless written a couple of hacks which do exactly that (I don't know of any other PbtA games which do the same thing):<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/19417/the-silver-dragons-tear-fantasy-apocalypse-world-for-kids-or-quick-play" rel="nofollow">The Silver Dragon's Tear</a><br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/17652/apocalypse-world-for-kids-the-bureau-an-aw-hack-with-different-die-types" rel="nofollow">The Bureau</a><br/><br/>I'd imagine someone has also done a FATE+PbtA moves thing at some point; if your "Aspects" or traits are activated based on an economy (like Fate points), you can get away with freeform traits without having to worry about balance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463990/#Comment_463990" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-14T23:03:29+00:00" title="June 14, 2017 11:03PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Reading the Silver's Dragon's Tear right now, and so far yes, this is how I'm applying PbtA too, with a small add: whenever you roll a 2, something goes wrong affecting the whole party; When you roll a 12 an opportunity appears for all the PCs. Fail forward or Success forward if you can't see an immediate way to apply it.<br/><br/>The hands of Fate mechanic is gorgeous. For a similar effect I'm using Karma points, which are left-overs of character creation points not invested in your PC skills. It doubles as a balancing mechanism between full fledged veteran PCs and inexperienced but lucky young PCs. You can perfectly start the game as any of them and progress or degrade to more or less skilled/functional characters.<br/><br/>There's another form of progression in the shape of "virtual levels": characters start in level 1, get to the next level by reaching story milestones. If they face a challenge of the same level system goes as normal, one above or below the level and they get a free advantage or disadvantage accordingly, and the monster's damage increases or decreases.  Finally for challenges two levels above or below, the players don't roll, it's either too easy to be a challenge and they get to describe how they overcome it, or it's way beyond their capabilities and they have to run or try to build enough advantages before facing it to level it down.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463991">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463991/#Comment_463991" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-14T23:10:58+00:00" title="June 14, 2017 11:10PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" rel="nofollow">WarriorMonk</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>You can perfectly start the game as any of them and progress or degrade to more or less skilled/functional characters.<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nThat's really cool, WarriorMonk.

Most of them are mechanics I already tried with my party that they have come to like, I'm doing most of this for them. The GM side is geared to suit my preferred gamestyle, which is 70% impro built over player's input, 20% <br/><br/>It started as a hack of Anima Beyond Fantasy, which is a hack of rollmaster. Players love the d100 and high bonuses so I'm keeping those; though if I end up making a public version I'll definitely keep it to 2d6 PbtA style.<br/><br/>I tried some Fate with it as well, though streamlining from the complexity of the original hack to the simplicity of the aspects wasn't every player's cup of tea. We ended up using Aspects mostly for things like PCs personality. Also, special abilities in Anima double for your class sometimes, like, a summoner is basically built around their summoning skill which they use for basically everything and so dumping all their points in it makes them good for everything if you go by the usual Fate rules. <br/><br/>Well, you can have players divide general summoning into summoning, controlling, binding and banishing their creatures as per the original game rules, and even replace controlling with all the social skills to make the summoner-creature a more roleplayable relationship, but then the most usual thing in the group was to dump all points into summoning, bring Godzilla in when they were in trouble and run away without trying to control or banish it later. It's a valid feeling, but come on, when you think into summoners that's rarely the feeling you're after for from the start, from both the players and GM side.<br/><br/>Also, there are always a few basic skills everyone is supposed to have unless they have a clear disadvantage for some reason. Specially when you are into an anime-like setting and all PCs are supposed to be murim-like, running and jumping through the rooftops. Sure, if that's the expected feeling you just give that for free to the players, but then you also need a way to state "well, this guy is a bit faster than you because that's his speciality"<br/><br/>There's also the skills you need everyone to have since as a GM they are key to move the story forward. This is why I ended up switching Attributes with the list mentioned posts above.<br/><br/>Then came Tenra Bansho, from which I hacked the emotional matrix (now turned into a random table part of the current version of my <a href="https://resourcefullrpg.wordpress.com/2012/04/14/8/" rel="nofollow">Resourcefull deck</a>)<br/>and part of the Karma system (which is the one that allows to build and play less experienced yet somewhat balanced characters)<br/><br/>Basically Karma in this game works this way, I'll use the 2d6 version of the game for the numbers part. You start with 20 points to make your character from which you can assign 1to 3 to each Approach (attack, defend, movement, perception, subterfuge, knowledge, recover) As an exception, recover can be at zero if your character has no idea of how to heal him/herself or others. Then you decide how of experienced you want your character and choose to have either 5, 10 or 15 skills and distribute up to 3 points on those, or leave skills at zero points if you like, that just means you learned the basics of it. Yes, you don't need to spent points to buy more skills, just to make them mechanically useful.<br/><br/>Here's the thing that balances this out: for each unspent character creation point, you get a Karma point, which can be spent in game to have an external influence change your fate. This is what makes even inexperienced characters functional in the game, the fate is on their side, even if that means they get into more unwanted trouble because of it. You get it back slowly, only at the end of each session, when we make the recount to see what the PCs did. If it had anything to do with their objectives, flaws, bonds or PC personality (their Aspects) they get one point for each. They can also replenish them at the beginning of an arch if it's a long campaign.<br/><br/>If your character progresses their skills in game you can decide how much it changes, but you're still spending your karma into skill points. So, now you've got better at X skill and even got a new one and raised to the top, but now you've got less karma, which means you're putting less into the hands of the gods and trusting more in yourself. Did you found a cool new sword? All right, learn how to use it, invest in the skill to handle it, otherwise it's just a common sword for you, no mechanical benefit.<br/><br/>One thing that Tenra isn't about but the mechanics somewhat allow is that you can level down! What if your character is getting older and now can't use their skills at their top? well, now in this hack you just exchange skill points back into Karma and you're the old master that coughs up blood whenever they show off their supernatural powers.<br/><br/>Which takes me to the Asura mechanic in Tenra, something the game <i>is</i> totally about: going beyond your limits at the risk of abandoning your humanity, which narratively can be interpreted in different ways. Here I'm somewhat keeping the Tenra mechanic, if you are at Karma points and need more, you go Asura and all your resources get replenished (HP, mana, whatever... maybe except for karma, I'm not sure) but after this scene your character becomes an NPC, a mere force of nature deprived of whatever made it human.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464034">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464034/#Comment_464034" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-15T19:31:32+00:00" title="June 15, 2017  7:31PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            PLEASE don't call it "Anima" ANYTHING.

For this system, as stated, mechanically game-wise, a knife isn't different from fire magic. From the narrative point of view however, they should be quite different and include the possibility of playing with the basic concept of the skill, its limitations and potential, mix it with other things and get new, surprising results that still make sense since they are still coherent with the basic mechanics.<br/><br/>This is something that I heard better explained on a video of a lecture or an interview of Brandon Sanderson about magic systems, that I can't find about right now. It's not the only way to deal with magic in narrative terms, but it's a way I certainly like: the author explains the basic rules of magic to the readers, and then comes up with a twist that uses a mix of those rules to introduce a twist that the reader isn't expecting, but that makes perfectly sense. I'm aware this can be done mechanically (after all, it isn't rare to read about some new D&amp;D character build that allows the player do things the system wasn't explicitly thought for) but I prefer the narrative approach, since I've never been much of a fan of delving in the manual looking for rules synergies that later make no sense in narrative terms (like the <a href="https://1d4chan.org/wiki/Peasant_Railgun" rel="nofollow">peasant railgun</a>, to quote an exaggerated example just for the fun of it) <br/><br/>So, let's say we've got our list of skills with somewhat open descriptions and a few limitations, and players are onboard on the idea of mixing them and go wild. We've been there before with our Anima hacks. Problem now is how to balance this so we know what the PCs are actually better at, otherwise we're risking giving too much agency to some players over the others. <br/><br/>For example, a player writes down on his character sheet "necromancy". For him his necromancy deals with curses that make their opponents mechanically less efficient (debuffs), raising undeads until he's got an army, instantly creating a bone armor or shield, draining blood from his enemies and using it to restore his health, making corpses explode for area damage, having undead servants perform simple tasks etc. This is actually a heck of a lot of skills hidden under a single aspect, which narratively makes sense, since he's a necromancer. But in game balance terms, it can be a bit game-breaking and unfair for other more traditional PCs and NPCs.<br/><br/>So instead of separating this skill into several ones and developing all sort of rules and rulings to limit the PC back into balance, I let the player have his fun, write down a single skill and let him choose in which kind of approach his character is better. If he's better skilled in Attack, he can use it for his curses and ordering a mass of undeads into battle. As a GM here I'm only concerned about how much damage he can do and how much does it take. If the PC is better in defense he's got his bone armour, can raise a shield of undead to protect himself or others, project a wall of souls to ward him from magic or psychical attacks, etc. as my only concern here as a GM is how good he is at avoiding direct damage. And so on for the rest of the approaches.<br/><br/>Heh, I'm keeping the Anima Ultimate name for our hack, since we've been calling our game Anima from the first campaign, despite whatever we were hacking those days, it's more applied to the campaign than to the game system. For the game system I'll definitely use a different name, though I don't know what it could be yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464214">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464214/#Comment_464214" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-20T17:15:36+00:00" title="June 20, 2017  5:15PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rephrasing that: I'll keep the name for our PRIVATE hack, but will definitely publish it under a different name, if I get to do so anyway. Sorry if the previous post came up too badly in that sense Airk, thanks for the suggestion.<br/><br/>I'm working on some further simplification and the explanation for the system basics. Current version:<br/><br/>-To do something, do it. Describe how and which skills/items you use and what advantages you may have.<br/>-Silently while listening to this, the GM will handle the player an Advantage Chip for each advantage he acknowledges as possible, up to 3. This is basically the GM just saying yes and going with the flow unless there's a logic/continuity mistake.<br/>-GM identifies the Approach (intention), asks for further detail if needed. <br/>-At any point in this exchange the GM can identify and call for any disadvantageous element influencing this conflict, up to 3 things. These cancel the advantages. The GM deals Disadvantage Chips to the player if there are more disadvantages than advantages. Again, this is no blocking, just trying to make things interesting... unless there are 3  disadvantages and no advantage left to cancel these, we'll get to this later.<br/>-Note: For each additional item/skill bonus called by the player to solve this conflict the GM assigns a Disadvantage Chip representing the concentration needed by the PC to coordinate everything.<br/>-The GM finally calls for the roll, which should include the bonus for the relevant approach and the skills/items used.<br/>-Then the player rolls the dice, bonuses apply, Advantage Chips add +1 to the roll, Disadvantage are -1. <br/>-If the condition that originated the chip disappears, its spent. Otherwise the player gets to keep it. (Like, a PC attacking from a high ground without leaving the position)<br/><br/>-There's a chance to get a -3 to the roll, then either the players try another way or choose to fail; the GM can determine if it's a fail forward or some other interesting result.<br/>-Chips apply to PCs only.<br/><br/>So back again to how narrative mechanics for skills fit into this: the game is all about negotiation over things already established on the fiction, which include anything on the character sheets. Things here are mostly narration, but some things still work under harder rules. Like necromancy or summoning, the PC can't just call an army of monsters for free, take them everywhere and have each do a different thing, hogging the spotlight. Or like magic, if it turns into a single aspect able to solve everything without limits, it's no fun.<br/><br/>So, having totally freeform traits for everything won't do. For more simple stuff it makes perfectly sense (like <i>strong, tall, stealth</i>) but for magic and other things it kinda ruins it. But then if you just tell the player "All right, for Necromancy you will always need to have a corpse or soul at hand to perform it, the power source is either blood or a soul and whenever you try to steal a soul from a living creature you must touch it and even wrestle one out of the other. You usually can't hide with it because of the decomposition smell and creepy aura, but otherwise you can do anything you want with it" then it's become more interesting. Now the players has to think creatively to avoid the pitfalls of the ability, which in turn makes the story more interesting.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464401/#Comment_464401" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-28T17:09:13+00:00" title="June 28, 2017  5:09PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            After some playtesting, seems there's barely no need for the chips. Things can be negotiated quite freely, advantages cancel disadvantages and each one represents a +-1 after all, so it's easy to keep the count. Chips move too fast to be of any significance as a reward, so no real need for them there. Yet for each skill with a bonus you want to add into your combo you get a disadvantage (-1), so roleplaying for advantages (+1) becomes mechanically important.<br/><br/>I was worried there could be issues with the time spent negotiating but there was none, the conversation was always fluid and felt natural.<br/><br/>I settled for freeform traits for everything that would be an ordinary mundane skill or species-related traits (still keeping some lists to give players inspiration and help built the setting mood, but it's up to them to use it or not). <br/><br/>But for anything considered reality-bending <i>Supernatural Powers</i> I added a few more rules to spice them up. <br/><br/>These require two skills, one is the <i> Power Source</i> and the other is the <i>Control Ability</i> -that can actually be any other mundane skill possesed by the character, except that this one informs us of what the PC does to use their supernatural power. Does he dance, paint creatures, utter words in the language of creation, sing, concentrates? That's the Control Ability. <br/><br/>The Power Source informs us of what is the character harnessing to bend the reality. Mana, Ki, the will of their god, a pact with a major elemental, souls, etc.<br/><br/>Each supernatural power also has three narrative limitations, like "can't be used to kill", "works only on animals", "needs an open flame on visual range to work" etc. I'm not sure if I should reduce it to two or make that dependant on how high are the bonuses for the Power Source and the Control Ability.<br/><br/>By making these two different skills instead of one and adding narrative limitations the system makes using supernatural powers a lot more interesting. First, the player will always add the bonuses of both the Power Source and the Control Ability, which guarantee the effect will usually be better than using a mundane skill alone. But in doing so they will always incur in a disadvantage (mechanically this happens whenever the PC uses two skills) to represent the difficulty of harnessing the power. The same power can be used either to attack, defend, move, detect, learn, etc. so it keeps being versatile and the only other limitations it has are narrative: Does the Power Source is unavailable somehow? Can the character currently use the Control Ability? How does the player circumvent the limitations of their power?<br/><br/>Also after playtesting I discovered it was way too easy to solve any situation using supernatural powers, piling up bonuses and adding resources to beat any difficulty. Which isn't totally bad, the idea is that the PCs can overcome anything by making good plans, obtaining advantages and burning resources. But I'm wondering if I can make going overboard all the time a bit more dangerous. Like, there's no problem if the players roll two sixes, add two bonuses and use 2 resource points for a total of 20. But if they go over 20 it means their power goes beyond their control. They do get what they wanted to happen and maybe more, but things go so overboard that their lives will change forever. <br/><br/>They will get a new flag called "what am I?" that could probably replace a positive one they had if they have no free space for it on their character sheet. The GM can limit the narrative effects so this time only the PC knows what happened, but the PC is now scared of their own power and what he could do if he were to lose its control.<br/><br/>Next time they go over 20 the flag changes to "I'm a monster!"; this time people close to the PC notice and their relationship changes, they become afraid of him, may try to stop, help or flee from them. The next is "No longer human", with the character showing more permanent and obvious signs of how their powers are affecting and changing them. And so on, each time the PC will dehumanize a bit more, to finally focus obsessively on their personal objective alone.<br/><br/>Still have to test the dehumanization bit, but I kinda like this bet better, do I (as a player) spend resources and pile bonuses to make sure things go my way, risking to become a monster? or do I play it safe and risk things going bad for me?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
