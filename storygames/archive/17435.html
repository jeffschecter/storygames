The game is at the stage where we've completed our background docs in draft and it would be helpful to get some external reviewers to have a look at them before we send them out to players (about 3000 words of text.)  Partly, this is from pride - I'd like to avoid howlers if I can, which is always a risk no matter how much research you do, but it's also responding to feedback we got earlier in the project from a friend.  He said that when he was attending some earlier larps that were in the multicultural space that he had trouble engaging with the games because he felt unsafe - he didn't feel that he could participate and then go back to his real life and talk about those games with his friends from those cultures.  So opening up the game documents for feedback is, I figure, one way to hopefully increase people's feeling of safety regarding the game, both for the participants and observers who might feel affected.<br/><br/>What you would get is:<br/>- profuse thanks and an invitation to the game (late January in Wellington)<br/>- a reviewer's credit<br/>- a complimentary copy of the game when it gets published (electronically via RPGNow/DriveThruRPG, probably some time next year)<br/><br/>Links and Stuff:<br/>- Game description: <a href="http://kapcon.rpg.net.nz/?q=FragrantHarbour" rel="nofollow">kapcon.rpg.net.nz/?q=FragrantHarbour</a><br/>- Conversations about the game on our local forum: <a href="http://nzrag.com/nzrbb/viewtopic.php?f=27&amp;t=422" rel="nofollow">Initial pitch for the game but mostly random chatter</a>, <a href="http://nzrag.com/nzrbb/viewtopic.php?f=14&amp;t=455" rel="nofollow">discussion about the cultural issues of the game.</a><br/><br/>If anyone is interested, would you Whisper me?  (In case it matters to anyone, yes, we're also inviting local contacts as reviewers, but more eyeballs is good, yes?)  Am very happy to answer any questions people might have.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Stephanie                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
