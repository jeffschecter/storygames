There are no dice - you just print out a deck of cards from the PDF.<br/><br/><b>Download the Zombie Movie deck <a href="http://adventuregame.freeiz.com/wp-content/themes/clear-line/downloads/Screenplay:%2028%20Nights%20of%20the%20Walking%20Dead.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a>, or from the <a href="http://adventuregame.freeiz.com/" rel="nofollow">website</a>.</b><br/>Print it out, cut out the cards, and you can play! The rules are pretty simple.<br/><img alt="image" src="http://adventuregame.freeiz.com/wp-content/themes/clear-line/img/zombielogonew.png"/><img alt="image" src="http://adventuregame.freeiz.com/wp-content/themes/clear-line/img/zombiespreadmini.png"/><br/><br/>* <b>I want to know what you like about it</b>, because I've worked on it loads and I could use the applause.<br/>* <b>I want to know what doesn't work for you</b>, because I've worked on it loads, and I want it to be as good as it can be. The rules, the art, the layout - nothing it too small or too big! If I can change it, I will, if I can't, I'll learn!<br/>* <b>If you want to playtest it and let me know how it goes, that would be REALLY helpful</b>. I've playtested it loads, but it's only been run once without me present, and I want to make sure it runs smooth!<br/><br/>Planned future decks include Superhero Movies, Costume Dramas, and The Slenderman. You can mix decks together to create funky new genres!<br/>It's an ideal convention game, it's easy-to-grasp for people who are new to roleplaying, and it teaches some story-making and GMing skills.<br/><br/>Thanks very much, and Happy Valentines!<br/><br/>- Ed<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406244/#Comment_406244" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-14T14:24:26+00:00" title="February 14, 2013  2:24PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Ed, I'm curious about what your game does different from similar games--Especially, in this case, <a href="http://www.arkenstonepublishing.net/zombiecinema" rel="nofollow">Zombie Cinema</a>. This isn't a dismissal in disguise. I'm genuinely curious, and it seems like good information for the thread to have.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406249">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Edmoo" title="Edmoo"><img alt="Edmoo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Edmoo">Edmoo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406249/#Comment_406249" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-14T14:47:39+00:00" title="February 14, 2013  2:47PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Hans <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>.<br/>I hadn't actually heard of <i>zombie cinema</i> before, so thanks!<br/><br/>In brief, here's the differences: Screenplay is designed to play any film genre, and to be able to mix them together (think <i>Pride and Prejudice and Zombies</i>). Also, the style of play is academically different - no dice, no game board etc.<br/><br/>Practically though, the pitch is the same - that is, as long as I'm pitching it as a zombie movie game. The solution would be to make the free promo deck something other than the zombie deck (to clarify - I'm planning to give one deck away for free. That was going to be the zombie deck, but perhaps I should look for another universally appealing genre).<br/><br/>That's a damn good start to the feedbacking! Thanks Hans!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
