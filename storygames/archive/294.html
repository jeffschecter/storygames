<p>I rather like the Tolkien take on fantasy as a time when Man's place in the universe is being defined and reified ... where the deeds of a few will mean not merely what the future is, but the metaphorical language in which future history will be written.</p>
<p>And I'm also quite charmed by the "leopard-look" fantasy of Conan and similar things, when the laws of man were looser bonds, and iron thews could pull free of them into a world of savage, crimson freedom.</p>
<p>"Barbarians were more polite than civilized man, because a civilized man could be impolite without getting his head bashed in, as a general thing."  Or something like that.  How can you not love that?</p>

Barbarians -- meh.  But then, in another life I was a foppish courtier.  Lack of manners only gives you fewer tools to express yourself.  But if it floats your boat.                        </div>

                            Tony hit on it. It's a setting that allows might to make right. The strength of your arm and your blade can change the world. And all that is alien is there for contrast, to bring the qualities and struggles of humanity into sharper relief.<br/>
<br/>
Also, it's simple. You can see struggle and consequences without trying very hard. The Knight rides out and slays the dragon -- the kingdom is saved! Frodo throws the ring into the fires of mount Doom. Nice and neat. We don't get that kind of clarity in real life. Fantasy metaphors make struggle and achievement easier to understand.                        </div>

                            Josh, <br><br>Because fantasy lets us call upon our romantic illusions, the golden age mythology of every culture in which the residual tags of a fading age are held up as cultural artificats, the innate streak of militantism, neo-luditism, and other grungy things that lurk in the foul rag and bone shop of the heart and pretend -- for a short time -- like we believe in any of them. (Or reiterate to ourselves that we do, in fact, believe in at least some of them. The power of repitition and ritual in storytelling is something a lot of texts on RPGing miss.) <br/><br/>Also, because a lot of us grew up on this stuff and the conventions of the various genres around fantasy (of which, I'll note, we're already starting to run into problems of when different people say the same word and mean different things) are part of our storytelling heritage. When you grew up reading the Lord of the Rings and the King of Elflands Daughter alongside Beowulf and The Charnel God, it becomes part of your cultural heritage. At that point either confronting it or celebrating it makes a potent tool for telling stories. <br/><br/>Finally, let us not forget that the kind of fantasy of which you speak is really at this point and in this context not so much Tolkien as it is D&amp;D. As for that, D&amp;D has become a genre of its own. Many RPers these days were not even born when the first Greyhawk setting books came out -- so for longer than they've been alive "game" and "fantasy" and "adventure" have gone together as one word in the mass cultural vocabulary.<br/><br/>Edit: Also, unlike snobs like you and I not everyone is all like "postmodernism is cool! lets deconstruct the centrality of common narrative and write books like Slaughterhouse 5." <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </br></br></div>

                            Josh, I had composed a reply but I'm really not sure what you mean by fantasy. I mean, I agree with John and Tony that those are attractions of some kinds of fantasy, but they're also found in <i>Star Wars</i>, which doesn't have dwarves, elves, or halflings. (Or does it? Are "fantasy races" a central component of the fantasy you're talking about?)<br/><br/>So if your question is "why 'fantasy' and not X", I think it'd be helpful to examine what sets "fantasy" off from other genres/settings. E.g., I'm rather a fan of <b>swords &amp; sorcery</b> as an RPG setting, but I hate Tolkienesque races outside of Tolkien.                        </div>

                            Ron's discussion of the "mainstream" and how far outside of it the gamer bullseye of chainmail bikini fantasy is, really resonates with me.  I think most fantasy - including Star Wars - is a little creepy.  So I won't sell you on fantasy, Josh.  I'll sell you the hell away from it.  <br/><br/>Of course to qualify that, I should say that I've never read Tolkien or Lieber or the Conan guy, and I didn't read a superhero comic until I was out of college.  And you know what?  I've got a whole screed about how that stuff warps you - in a spooky, Pavlovian way - into accepting ideas that are really odd.  Every single person I know who was exposed to that stuff as a kid reacts to it in a way I find profoundly strange.                        </div>

<i><b>Finally, let us not forget that the kind of fantasy of which you speak is really at this point and in this context not so much Tolkien as it is D&amp;D.</b></i><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I was a bit terse, I guess. I was trying to get at something like what Brand's saying.<br/>
<br/>
But also: the great works of 'fantasy' that we read and cite really share only Colour. Le Guin writes <i>A Wizard of Earthsea</i> as story of personal growth through an almost Buddhist ethic. Tolkien writes <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> as an expression of longing for bygone days. Howard writes about Conan and Kane from his own fantasies of masculinity and strength. These and many more, don't begin and end with 'fantasy'. The authors chose to write in settings that reflected their own take on life, their own ideology. So it's substance first, form next.<br/>
<br/>
Whereas it seems to me that so much of the endless multi-volume series of bookshop fantasy assumes form and ignores substance--just like the vast majority of RPG fantasy.<br/>
<br/>
So I don't think 'fantasy' is a good choice for anything at all. Rather, I think that if what you want to do includes placing it in an imaginary medievalesque world, do that. Don't start by saying 'I want swords and dragons on the set by 3pm...hmmm, now what will we shoot?'                        </div>

                            I love fantasy. I even love crap fantasy, though sometimes it's like eating nothing but frosting. I only wish there were more of it done up as space adventure in the style of Vance's <i>Demon Princes</i> or <i>Planet of Adventure</i>.<br><br>For me, otherwhere settings accentuate the stuff that <i>isn't</i> different.

                            Eliot -- "what is fantasy" is a whole nother topic, and probably one that must be answered before this topic can be adequately discussed, I'm sure.  Babylon 5 has more in common with the Lord of the Rings than the Wizard of Earthsea does, for instance.  Mostly I'm talking about the stuff that you can see it and identify it as Fantasy in a second: a guy with long ears, long yellow hair, and a bow steps out of a forest.  It's immediately recognizable.<br><br>As for the rest (forgive my paraphrases):<br>Tony says "man (player avatar) has no dictated role."<br>John says "freedom to claw out your own role, simplicity to identify it with our lives."<br>Brand says "escapism allowing us to examine our cultural heritages."<br>Brand also says "cause it's what we know."<br>Thor says "exotic settings allow more freedom to imagine."<br/>Jason says Fantasy sucks.<br/>Droog says "fantasy is just a color palette, what matters is what you paint."<br/>Matt says "fantasy allows us to marginalize the unimportant details."<br/><br/>See, Droog states the foundation of my question.  If Fantasy is just a color palette, what ever makes it a <em>more appropriate</em> color palette than any other?<br/><br/>Tony, John, Thor, and Matt seem to be approaching the question along similar lines.  Fantasy, as a 'simpler' color palette, allows us more freedom to play with the themes that we're most interested in.  (Note: I'm using simpler not as a perjorative, but strictly in the sense of information bits required to maintain coherency.)  I can buy that.  But if all we need is a simpler color palette, why <em>this</em> simpler color palette?<br/><br/>And then Brand rolls in with all his cultural relativism bullcrap.  This simpler color palette is familiar, and deeply rooted in the way that we understand stories, and so fundamentally it's powerful.  More powerful than, say, Aztecs and Toltecs battling over territory will ever be.  The long-haired pointy-eared guy with the bow coming out of the forest is an elf, and we all know that in 0.2 seconds, and we all have expectations about what that <em>means</em> that can then be manipulated.<br/><br/>So basically Fantasy seems to be the 16 Color Crayola Set: simple, easy to use, familiar.<br/><br/>Jason, is 16 Colors too few, and leads to oversimplifications of color range and the fetishizing of sky blue, brick red, and goldenrod?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Thor - I was about to agree with you, then I popped back out to the list of discussion topics. And at the top of the list was "non-european settings." And I had to come back here. Because the few times I've tried really non-european settings, they've been a miserable failure (and I've pretty much refused to do anything Japanese because I know so little about that culture, or the fantasized versions, that I know I'd butcher it).<br/>
<br/>
So in one sense, having the game be very unreal is easier, but in another sense, I think the culture and psychology does need to be familiar.<br/>
<br/>
But getting back to why fantasy? Given that I think it's fair to lump most of the SF in gaming in with fantasy also (and heck, even gun era historical gaming - Dogs in the Vinyard is very much a fantasy in my mind). I think it comes down to that pretending about things that are very unreal is just cool. Who wants to play Papers and Paychecks?<br/>
<br/>
Now if you want Fantasy to mean stuff that is Tolkienesque/D&amp;Desque, I think it comes down to two things. First, the success of sword and sorcery fiction. Second, the fact that D&amp;D captured the lions share of the market because it was first. And it's good enough. And basically it's a train without a director that is very difficult to stop or divert. Lots of folks are gonna jump on that train.<br/>

You are not alone.  I didn't become aware of a lot of that stuff until I was in my 20s (in which I still am now).  Of course, being black and female may have something to do with my lack of exposure to these things.                        </div>

Sixteen colours ought to be plenty, if you use them to create something. If all you're doing is colouring between the lines, it doesn't matter if you've got a box of a hundred crayons in delicately graded shades.                        </div>

                            Hi Josh!<br>
  Well, if you have to be sold on Fantasy, it's probably not right for you, but Fantasy has it's advantages:<br>
Learning curve - Players can grok the setting faster and get to the rules and game play sooner<br>
Magic - Less suspension of disbelief is required for Magic in a fantasy setting<br/>
Combat - Combat is up close and personal, modern settings always have the potential for an unseen sniper...<br/>
Moral ambiguity - Characters can rob and kill with less of the modern repercussions<br/>
Fantasy - It is harder to relate events in a sword and sorcery setting to modern probelms in the player's lives, thus enhancing the escapism<br/>
<br/>
  I'm not saying it's the best setting ever. And I would never assert that it is for everyone. But if the above appeals to you, then go for it!<br/>

                            On the widespread <b>appeal</b> of fantasy:<br/><br/>A man cannot become a child again, or he becomes childish. But does he not find joy in the child's naivete, and must he himself not strive to reproduce its truth at a higher stage? Does not the true character of each epoch come alive in the nature of its children? Why should not the historic childhood of humanity, its most beautiful unfolding, as a stage never to return, exercise an eternal charm? <br/>...................................................................................................<br/><br/>Thus the ancient conception, in which man always appears (in however narrowly national, religious, or political a definition) as the aim of production, seems very much more exalted than the modern world, in which production is the aim of man and wealth the aim of production. .... Hence in one way the childlike world of the ancients appears to be superior; and this is so, insofar as we seek for closed shape, form and established limitation. The ancients provide a narrow satisfaction, whereas the modern world leaves us unsatisfied, or, where it appears to be satisfied, with itself, is <i>vulgar</i> and <i>mean</i>.<br/><br/><b>Marx, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Grundrisse</span></b><br/> </div>

                            DnlnDenver,<br/><br/>It's funny (but the joke's emphatically <i>not</i> on you) that you cite moral ambiguity as a feature of fantasy, while others would cite stark moral clarity as a feature. And furthermore both can be used as excuses for violence.<br/><br/>It just highlights the vagueness of what "fantasy" means to different people. FWIW, I think the kind that Josh is talking about tends toward the moral clarity end of the scale.<br/><br/>But maybe it'd be best to break down the features one by one. Starting with elves. I'll have a word or two to say about them (unless someone beats me to it), but I'm in a bit of a rush right now.                        </div>

                            As far as what "fantasy" <i>is</i>, there are two ways to define any genre: by theme or by color.<br/><br/>For example, is Star Wars fantasy? It certainly has the color of SciFi, but its themes have more in common with fantasy.<br/><br/>The themes of fantasy are usually a black and white good versus evil struggle... Let's see, there's often the idea that one man change the world... and I'm not sure what else, honestly I havent read that much fantasy.<br/><br/>BTW, Howard didn't consider Conan to be fantasy---he considered part of the surrealist horror genre (thanks Sorcerer &amp; Sword!).                        </div>

                            It is going to be subjective; It has to be subjective - If i write a story about travelling to Tibet, but i haven't actually, you know, been there, then my story is going to be somewhat fantastic, somewhat unreal. Is that then fantasy? If i add in an ancient order of hidden llamas, is that then fantasy? How about if they have mythic martial arts abilities? Can call lightning and throw fire?<br/>
<br/>
The use of a defined fantasy nomenclature probably has much to do with the "suspension of disbelief" - normally we can only stretch things so far before our audience dismisses them, but if we tell them up-front that we are breaking the conventions of reality, then they'll have a chance to nod and get into it.<br/>
<br/>
As for why Tolkien's fantasy? I can only surmise that it appeals to modern people's Romanticism...                        </div>

                            Okay, I'm back. Elves are one of the things that I like just fine in Tolkien, but which I strongly dislike in nth generation fantasy roleplaying derivatives, even those I otherwise like such as Harn, Runequest, etc. So for me to talk about them in that context is a bit like speculating on the attraction of someone else's religion: it's bound to be patronizing, and it may be flat-out wrong.<br/><br/>The thing about Elves in D&amp;D is that at least originally, D&amp;D was a pastiche of various fantasy influences. In my opinion, its use of Elves is both a parody and a tribute to Tolkien. I think later games, including possibly later versions of D&amp;D, picked up on many D&amp;D elements but lost the satiric relationship to the original source material. (I see a strong parallel in the development of <i>Star Wars</i>--what started as a loving parody became canonized and smothered by reverence.) Whatever Elves were to Tolkien, I think that present-day FRPG fans are attracted to them through a combination of:<br/><br/>Romanticized Celtophilia (which might have to be scrutinized in its own right)<br/>Angsty reflection on a lost Golden Age<br/>Flight from the mundane and the profane, the commercial and the industrial in favor of high-minded devotion to Art and mystical harmony with Nature (There's a bit of the Noble Savage in Elves, except that they deny the irony of the Noble Savage-Sinful Civilization dichotomy. Elves are a vestige of a Noble Civilization.)<br/>Possibly, in some cases, a bit of Northern European racism--it's hard to ignore the way that fairhaired, light-skinned, rural/sylvan Elves are being crowded out by rapidly-breeding, crude humans who crowd burgeoning cities--like early 20th-century immigrants from southern and eastern Europe.<br/>Possibly, in some cases, a bit of orientalist fetish. It's hard to ignore the slight build and almond-shaped eyes.<br/><br/>One of the few non-tongue-in-cheek, non-Tolkien-derivative depictions of Elves I've seen in gaming that I've enjoyed is that which appears in <i>Albion: Land of Faerie</i>, an obscure wargame produced by SPI back in the early 80's. While there are parallels with Tolkien in that game, the influences are more directly from Irish &amp; Welsh mythology, and medieval romance filtered through English Renaissance poetry/drama. (E.g., the king of Elves is Auberon.) <i>Albion</i> does recycle the usual tropes of a noble Golden Age civilization which is destroyed through a combination of hubris, external evil, and loss of vigor compared to the "new race" of men. But at least it picks a different moment to show: the crisis of the civilization, when Elves (called Sidhe in the game) are still dominant but threatened--not the time long after when the Elves sing whiny lays about their lost glory.<br/><br/>Tolkien did much the same thing with the <i>Silmarillion</i>, although there the fall of Elvish civilization has a clearer historical parallel (conscious or not) with World War I, a self-inflicted tragedy which basically destroyed the old European social order, put the fortunes of Europe into the hands of "younger, more vigorous, but less cultured" America &amp; Russia, and was in many ways a symbolic culmination of the destructive effects of industrialization on humanity (machine gun, tank, and submarine replacing the chivalrous sword and horse and the picturesque and romantic sailing warship).                        </div>

                            Hi!<br/>
  OK, I get what you mean, the divisions of good and evil are more clearly defined in "Traditional Fantasy" whatever that means.<br/>
  But, the kill stuff and take their stuff mentality is more acceptable in Fantasy games than in other settings in my opinion. Of course that is a gross generalization, but that is what I was referring to in my "Moral Ambiguity" point...<br/>

                            I may have missed this but...<br/><br/>Sometimes there is no deep answer to the question "why this?" in any medium. It's a combination of (often) hard work by a lot of people and the whim of the world when that work is presented. Umberto Eco's essay on the various uses of the Middle Ages makes the point: they serve lots of different purposes. They're popular now because works of medievaloid fantasy happened to capture imaginations in the past. It could have been something else, but either nobody did it at the right time or something got in the way of the audience appreciating it.<br/><br/>It's not an entirely random process. There are qualities that a successful milieu is likely to have, in some mix, and some neat ones just don't get there. But there are always going to be ones that could have caught on, or <i>did</i> catch on for a while but haven't stayed with us. (Look at a lot of the pulp genres. Or, for a more interesting case in some ways, the nurse novel, huge for a century and now collapsed almost to nothing, and it collapsed pretty quickly, as changes in law and practice widened the real-world options for working women.) <br/><br/>So there may sometimes not be a point in drilling too deeply - sometimes it's there because it's there.                        </div>

<p>But generally, the reason that it's okay to kill things and take their stuff is because the heroes are Good and the things being killed are Evil, hostile, and/or non-sentient/uncivilized. Oh, they're frequently ugly, too.</p>
<p>Look at D&amp;D. Dragons are color-coded into "okay to kill" and "not okay to kill": Good dragons have shiny scales ("metallic dragons") and evil dragons don't ("chromatic dragons").</p>
<p>Sometimes, you'll see evil parties, and in that case, it's okay to kill things and take their stuff because you're Evil.</p>
<p>In most gaming, this isn't questioned. In more "mature" games, (i.e., those that look more deeply into cultural ramifications, philosophy, politics, etc.) these assumptions might get questioned. But they're kind of the standard.</p>
<p>Note: yes, not all games have Good and Evil as alignment systems. But it's pretty obvious when a character's supposed to be a Great Hero.</p>

                            Timfire asked: "is Star Wars fantasy? It certainly has the color of SciFi, but its themes have more in common with fantasy. The themes of fantasy are usually a black and white good versus evil struggle... Let's see, there's often the idea that one man change the world... and I'm not sure what else..."<br/>
<br/>
Tim's thought congealed with Joshua Newman's talk about , thus:<br/>
<br/>
Science fiction, in the strict sense, is outside-in: Here is something about the universe, or technology, or society as it uses technology -- how does that external circumstance cause characters to change?<br/>
<br/>
Whereas fantasy strikes me as inside-out: Here is something in the soul of a person -- regret for the lost past versus hope for the future (Tolkein), anger at your father versus desire to redeem him (George Lucas) -- now how does that internal struggle cause that person to change the external world?<br/>
<br/>
And I think the profound, gut-level appeal of the great fantasies is that your personal, internal struggle does, in fact, play out on a global scale, so that when you change, the world changes with you: Aragorn overcomes doubt and there is a new kingdom, Luke makes peace with his father and the Republic is restored, Ged confronts his own mortality and the balance between life and death returns, Buffy graduates from high school and it blows up, any number of generic boy (occasionally girl) heroes come-of-age and the Big Evil is defeated.... It's the "pathetic fallacy" (e.g. my protagonist is sad, therefore it is raining) with a cast of thousands. Which is pretty darn cool.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, being a first-level anything doesn't quite deliver on that promise, but, well, it still resonates, because it .                        </div>

                            First off, in response to Brand and Bruce -- I am not asking "Why do so many people buy all those Fantasy books with elven boobies on the covers?"  I know that answer -- elven boobies.  What I'm asking is "Why do you, yes <em>you</em> who are reading those post, choose to play in games with fantasy settings?  Why do you (yes, you) design games with fantasy settings?"  Popularity's irrelevant.  I'm asking what Fantasy <em>does</em> and what <em>uses</em> it has.<br/><br/>Similarly, for all the people who are talking about the <em>fantastic</em> and not Fantasy -- yeah, I'm talking about the 16-Color genre with swords'n'sorcery'n'elves'n'bards.  Why is it that you, yes you, might decide that swinging a sword and slinging a spell will do it for you were machine guns, spaceships, or atlatls won't?<br/><br/>So far, the best answers I've heard are the simplicity and familiarity arguments -- easy to manipulate to our own ends because it's got few moving parts and we know them by heart.  But, as Eliot points out, that familiarity with the nice and simple probably masks a whole lot of unexamined and potentially darker corners of ourselves.  I find that interesting.                        </div>

<p>That's a hard question, Josh.</p>
<p>That is, it's not particularly easy to answer, "Why does this engage me creatively, and this other thing doesn't?"</p>
<p>For me, fantasy is swords-and-sorcery, but wider perhaps than D&amp;D. <em>The Hero &amp; the Crown</em> and <em>The Shattered World</em> are both fantasy to me. So is <em>The Waterborn</em> and <em>The Enchanted Castle.</em> That makes my fantasy, mm, maybe 24 colours. I <em>know</em> this stuff from deep in my childhood, so it has that savor of aging and percolating that other stuff doesn't - to me, cyberpunk is flat, unleavened. Just katanas and trenchcoats and LEDs.</p>
<p>Deliberate emulation of real-world cultures is the same - I don't have a basis in this stuff that's broad and well-settled. I can paint a picture of Mesoamerica with feathers and obsidian and an (to us) alarming priest/aristocracy that believes in the <em>urgent necessity</em> of bloodletting to appease the gods, who are all swirling, Chthonic, feathered and many-eyed, but it doesn't really resonate properly. The colors are too bright, and each piece is too distinct from the others.</p>
<p>When I play in fantasy, it is like a familiar cuisine: I know how the ingredients relate to each other, how to balance the straightforward darkness of a monster with a complex half-corrupted priesthood, how to substitute if someone is allergic to dragons or ginger. I know how much detail to put into something so that it doesn't seem raw, or overthought and limp.</p>
<p>I guess all this is saying, deep down, is this: "Ever since I was young, I learned what the world of fantasy looks like, through fairy tales and television and later, through books of increasing length; there aren't really robust sources for other genres that didn't turn to dust in my mouth. (Compare E. Nesbit and Nancy Drew someday.) As I got older, I found new genres, but nothing really feels like home turf the way fantasy does." The sheer <em>age</em> of the genre means that you can find <em>good</em> stuff to immerse into at any age, and the youth stuff isn't all insultingly educational or equally insultingly dumbed-down.</p>
<p>And then when I found gaming, there were elves and hobbits and bards, and I said, "I know this."</p>

                            Josh, <br/><br/>I am telling you why I like fantasy, and why I don't like it. Apparently, because I took something of a hands-off tone you mistook my points for the general. <br/><br/>I like it and don't like it because of the entire idea of the current vs. the residual and the romanticization of the previous age. It's pretty clearly expressed in "Wind and the Lion" when el-Raisuli gives the talk about how guns are random and ugly weapons, and that real men fight each other with swords so that they can see the eyes of their enemy. (Mirroed in Star Wars with the "a more elegant weapon for a more elegant age" line.) <br/><br/>I mean, on one hand this is obvious romantic crap. On the other hand, despite that it works well in fiction because it causes a resonance (or dissonance) of ideas. Which hits me harder, the duel of jet pilots at Mach 5 with laser guided weapons or that of sword on sword in a circle of dirt? The latter. Why? Because the latter has a lot of history, a lot of warrior culture nonesense built up around it in literature and song and story that is only now starting to build up around the former.*<br/><br/>So when I'm looking to confront (or celebrate) issues of violence and the male identity, or anything similar and less pretentious sounding, I'm going to be more drawn to the sword on sword angle. It's deeper wedged into my psyche, for whatever combination of reasons, and so lingers there. <br/><br/>There is also, I think, probably the still lingering issue (after how many hundreds of years?) of reason vs faith, of the subjective vs objective universe. I think many of us are pretty much of the rational and humanisitic leaning, and despite having an identifiable religion with obvious mystical overtones, I am one such. I see the world as ordered and understandable, I believe in law and civilization and not hitting the idiot who uses their cell phone in the theatre durring Lord of the Rings the Musical. And yet there is this little hobgoblin of my mind, this cultural trap door, that still likes the idea of the universe rotating about the earth (or about myself), that likes the ideas of honor and vengeance and spirit morality being more important than ethical calculus or planned communities. It's a clash of things inside our culture, and inside myself.<br/><br/>I could also walk through similar issues around individualism vs collectivism, neo-tribalism vs nationalism, and on and on and on. However, at this point I hope I've belabored the point from my earlier post enough to make it clear enough to be seen. <br/><br/>Fantasy, in the traditional mold you're specifying, points at all of those areas. Those residual, fading or resurficing areas of the Brand-cultural pysche where the idea of "barbarism's innate savage honesty" clash with my aware-mind certainty that barbarism is a bunk concept, and that savagry (what folks like Howard were really talking about) is nothing to be admired and is, in fact, the force that always loses. I'm saying that there is a lot about fantasy that is unexamined, things that contain all the tropes of our civilization and culture as it goes through change that sit there festering or fermenting -- depending on how you feel about each individual issue. <br/><br/>When I can walk up to issues like that and slap them in the face, I like fantasy. When I can push and pull and use swords and non-rationalism and both escape into and escape from a world that is both what I want and what I fear, I love it. <br/><br/>Now, I think its worth noting that very little fantasy gives this to me anymore. Or, it simply embraces all the atavistic things that I want to confront with an uncritical acceptance that speaks of the uglier forms of essentialism. Which is why I dislike fantasy and don't do nearly as much of it as I used to. <br/><br/>When I still do I tend to push into different areas of fantasy. I like Exalted because it is actually a comic book -- a genre that I still love to play in. (Thank you Astro City and Batman Beyond.) I like the Mountain Witch because it does actually push issues of violence, trust, and the forces they set free. I like Polaris because it isn't really fantasy, it's a fairy tale. I like Midnight because it makes you the terrorist. I like A Game of Thrones because it turns fantasy into a historical novel with magic, and in so doing sets some of the old issues free to run fuckety again. <br/><br/>And that, Charlie Brown, is what Brand's issues with fantasy are all about.<br/><br/><br/>*For me, of course. Someone raised on a military base never reading Tolkien or Beowulf may have the opposite reaction.                        </div>

                            I tend to like pre-modern fantasy, when I want to run or play it, because there are fewer assumptions to check. "Medieval Europe in the style of McCauley and the Gieses, plus [insert things]" is tidier to convey, a lot of the time, than the mix of elements I feel I need to pin down an sf setting. Even a setting a bit more exotic often comes with handy references, incuding pictures and Discovery Channel or History Channel documentaries. <br/><br/>Now of course what I'm interested in the setting may not be what others are. Like, the next time I run a medieval European or Crusades game, women knights will loom large in because I think they're interesting. A friend and I actually did pitch a Silk Road book to Atlas Games at one point, but they seemed a lot more concerned with the boundaries between Turkic and Sinic language groups, whereas we were thinking "Let's make Marco Polo an accurate chronicler, and also the folks telling him things," so that we'd have the land of people with two heads and one foot, and all like that. One of these days I'll run the game where China does expand its empire across the Pacific, and make the trials and tribulations of cultural assimilation the main point.<br/><br/>But mostly I think it's the ease of establishing a baseline.                        </div>

<i>Which hits me harder, the duel of jet pilots at Mach 5 with laser guided weapons or that of sword on sword in a circle of dirt? The latter. Why? Because the latter has a lot of history, a lot of warrior culture nonesense built up around it in literature and song and story that is only now starting to build up around the former.</i><br/><br/>There are two angles to this, Brand. On one hand, it can't be denied that the choice of traditional fantasy is a matter of familiarity with the idiom. On the other hand, there really is a difference in the suitability of the two concepts for the desired theme. Which is also reflected in how the theme warps depictions. Sword fighting always involves the direct clash of individuals who can see each other. Aerial combat by contrast has tended to be conducted at greater and greater ranges, often being decided by ambush and, in the modern era, without ever visually sighting the enemy. Yet fictional depictions of air combat still tend to emphasize the close-in dogfight.<br/><br/>This is another way that <i>Star Wars</i> is fantasy, and I think that bears on part of Josh's question. Traditional fantasy has selected those elements of culture that are particularly suited to emphasizing certain themes, also warping them to heighten those themes. Sometimes in real-time: there were attempts to ban the crossbow because it upset the superiority of the knight.<br/><br/>At the same time, though, I think we're still better off talking about individual fantasy elements or particular constellations of elements rather than fantasy as a whole. E.g., the pseudo-medieval background with kings, castles, and peasants is a common feature of the fantasy genre, but is generally played down in swords &amp; sorcery (such as Leiber) even though the latter does share with fantasy the idea of individual heroism.                        </div>
