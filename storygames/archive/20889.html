My game is basically a Game of Thrones type of game with character archetypes that match GoT characters: the bastard, the manipulative  schemer, the innocent beauty, the honorable  Lord, the evil king etc... these characters all have different motives, wants, and goals and this needs to be able to be managed in the story game... Player versus player situations can arise or at least character versus character,  I need to be able to manage these without a GM... it is very important to me that the story game version is GMless but I don't know how to accomplish some of my goals yet with such a configuration\u2026<br/><br/>How do I create scenes where one character gets what they want and another character doesn't and make sure that the scenes are still balanced and one character is not getting too much if they are in charge of framing the outcome of the scene? How do I make the outcome unknown, dramatic and have some element of chance (probably with the dice roll ha ha) but most importantly how do I translate this into a scene that has boundaries that most likely need to be self enforced by the "winner"? <br/>... I want to avoid things like collaborating on scenes and would rather handle it another way but this may be unavoidable... A compromise might be to have the adversarial player on the "losing" end of the situation veto any scene that goes too far in creating an advantage or outcome for the "winning" player\u2026 or prior to the scene intent is discussed and outcomes are agreed upon\u2026 However, this does require collaboration, which again, might be unavoidable\u2026but if it is necessary what is the best way to minimize it so that it doesn't take players out of the story?<br/><br/>... in my role playing game version there are stakes to actions;  for example, if one of the characters try to conspire against another character or NPC  they could either fail, succeed with a cost or complication, or be successful.  For example, if you fail you might be being overheard by an enemy when conspiring, succeeding with a complication might be that the NPC agrees to conspire but does not trust you,  and a success might be that the NPC agrees to conspire in good faith... this is determined by a dice roll in the role playing game version... how do I create the same tension and chance of failure or success in a story game version?  Or at least stakes to the attempt?<br/><br/>Also, in role playing game version you can get certain  disadvantages or advantages by  successfully placing conditions on other characters or having them placed on yourself; for example,  you may emotionally scar someone and if that condition if relevant it may make them easier to manipulate or to break their will in someway in the current or future a scene \u2026 How do I accomplish this in a story game? <br/><br/> In the role-playing game version  you can gain leverage on another person by knowing their secrets; for example, knowing they are having an affair, or knowing they're planning to betray the king\u2026  how do I accomplish this in Story Games? <br/><br/>I feel like I'm going to have to have different players take on GM like role and create the scene for other players and for these roles to have to rotate, but how do I do this when the relationships between characters and players can be adversarial\u2026 Maybe I have to have scenes which are negotiated, but I really don't want to as that takes the players out of the fiction...I would rather have rules direct this process somehow...do you think it would be better to have some level of negotiation as long as the rules for the process of negotiation were very clear and help to meet the objectives of the game?<br/><br/>... how would you approach all these things? If you were designing a story game based on a similar subject, with similar character archetypes, with characters that can have different motives and adversarial relationships, and that was meant to be GMless,  how would you approach it? How would you designe it?  Would there be any games that you think would help to inspire ideas or designs especially worth looking at? <br/><br/>Anyway you can help would be super appreciated. I feel really good about how the role-playing version of my game is developing; but quite frankly, I am completely lost when it comes to the Story game version of my game, and it is very important to me that I designed both.

But I have no idea how to do this procedurally without a GM: How do you keep certain information secret from one another in a collaborative GMless game? How do you balance power dynamics and create balanced scenes when player relationships can often be adversarial?  Basically, I'm having a hard time figuring out how to create procedures in a GMless collaborative story game context that mimic what I am achieving in the other version  of the game. Are there GMless games out there that can handle these type of interpersonal dynamics? I think one of the obvious issues is that I'm just not as well read or experienced in games that are GMless and collaborative as I am in GMed games... I probably just need some more reading and playing <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Are there collaborative GMless games that are primarily Narrativest with a bit of Gamist elements?  And, no, I don't care what GNS theory says about mixing these elements ha ha...many of the procedures in the other version of the game are there to enrich and create a better story, and I would like the effect of those procedures to translate to this game also, but I don't think that they reflect on the interpersonal dynamic going on or the goals of the players per se...Anyway, I probably just need to hit the books.

That's one of the hardest design specs I've heard in a while. Hmmm.<br/><br/>If you want secrets and competition between the players (in a GMless variant), you might want to look at boardgames. <i>Diplomacy</i> comes to mind, for sure.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I still maintain that you need to think carefully about what the players are trying to do in the game. Are they competing with each other? If they're not, what provides adversity for them?<br/><br/>If the game is based around conflict (as most games are), you will have <i>active parties</i> (it sounds like you want players to advocate for their characters and maneuver towards goals and success as best they are able) and you will have <i>adversity</i>. It sounds like you want those to be present both mechanically and fictionally. Not an easy thing to do! But think about this: who is providing the adversity which the characters struggle against?<br/><br/>If you share what you have of the GMed version of the game, or at least tell us what you find most fun and exciting about it (whether large-scale, or small-scale, like a particular mechanic), we can start thinking about what to adapt and what to drop. <br/><br/>(Although if you have this fantastic, working game, I wonder why you want to strip out the GM! My guess is that you'll find the GM is absolutely key to the game you have, so replacing that functionality will mean changing the roles of the other players quite dramatically.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458521">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458521/#Comment_458521" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-03T08:53:02+00:00" title="December  3, 2016  8:53AM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I should add:<br/><br/>Dealing with "secret information" is always a difficulty, I think, in roleplaying/story games.

What if in the GMless version, you play as advisors instead of the leaders/rulers?<br/><br/>In the world-building, each player could create a hidden piece of information about the ruler/territory in which their advisor begins the story.  This information would only become public and activate if a battle or other operation takes place involving that ruler or territory.  Then there could be mechanics for discovering the hidden information in other areas.  So the rulers (essentially NPCs at this point) stay in their given territories, and possibly overtake others, but advisors could possibly visit other territories, have spies, work deals, etc. to learn this hidden information.  Forming alliances could involve sharing at least some of the hidden information about each place.  Advisors could also switch sides mid-game as well.  You could also have players create some true and some false hidden information, and when they share they cover up the part of the card that indicates if it is true or false, creating the possibility for misinformation and double-crossing.<br/><br/>You could have a "Loyalty" stat that suffers when switching allegiance, but it could be worth it to be on the winning side.  There could also be a mechanic for generating more hidden information throughout the game so you never could know every possible factor.  And maybe the battle doesn't even take place, the game is only an information-gathering game.<br/><br/>I don't know enough about your game to know if any of this fits with what you're doing, but I think if you're going to make a GMless variant, you might as well make it wildly different than the RPG version.

One type of "leverage" is "secretes." You can get a "secret" on someone just in the course of play like you find out someone is cheating on their spouse. But my game also has mechanics/procedures that create "secretes" during play. Say I have a character and I'm searching an NPCs room for information that they may be part of a conspiracy to overthrow the crown. In my game they can succeed, succeed with a cost or complication, or fail. Also, and <b>very importantly</b> failure or success with a cost or complication does not have to happen immediately. Also, what happens during a failure, success with a cost or complication, or success is not predetermined by a list, like in a PbtA game, it is created in the moment by the GM and completely subject to the context and the fiction. So in the above example, if the character was searching the room and failed they might feel the sting of a dagger tip to their back and find that they have been discovered by the NPC, if the character succeeded with a cost or complication then the GM would tell the character that they found information tying the NPC to the conspiracy (this would create a secret on the NPC) but the GM would also know that the character's necklace feel off into the NPCs dresser drawer while searching and this would create a secret on the character (i.e. the NPC would know the PC had been searching their room), if the character was successful then they would find the information and this would create a secret on the NPC. This is all assuming of course that the NPC was in on the conspiracy, if not the stakes of failure would not be so high, which is another tenet of the game...the higher the reward the higher the risk<br/>Anyway PCs keep secrets on NPCs<br/>The GM keeps secretes on the PCs<br/>If a secret about say an NPC gives you adversarial info on another PC it's time to pass notes or have someone leave the room but this shouldn't happen a ton although if you wanted to push things in that direction you could...although having to leave the room every ten minutes doesn't sound like much fun <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Anyway, just to clarify Paul, I'm not changing the game to a GMless game, I'm trying to make two versions: 1 with a GM and 1 without.

Think of it as characters in a sort of faction with shared goals against another NPC faction mostly. <br/><br/>The more I think about it the less I'm interested in creating an emulation of my RPG and more interested in creating a GoT like Story Game that may have other goals and be easier to create.

I don't see any reason why it couldn't do both!<br/><br/>Your system inspirations, on the other hand, sound pretty integrated with a traditional distribution of authority, where most people at the table are responsible for one character, and whatever else they're responsible for probably shouldn't interfere with that.  I could be wrong, but that's my impression from the system bits you've mentioned previously.<br/><br/>I don't think that's a great starting point to build a GMless story game from.  I think if you want build a GMless Game of Thrones story game, you need to include some new system inspirations.  What are you most excited about right now, regarding how GMless story games work?  What such systems do you want to use as is, or tweak to make your own?<br/><br/>Once I know that, I'd be happy to help brainstorm ways to interface that with Game of Thrones.<br/><br/>If you've already answered that question in this thread, oops!

This is a very smart way to handle this. I have to go to work and don't have a lot of time, but I get off at 9:30 PM Mountain standard time and I can address it more fully then. <br/>Elements of other games I like and would like to bring into the story game:<br/><br/>I like certain things about the game Follow by Ben.  I'm not sure if you play tested it, or are familiar with it. But I like the way the relationships or past connections in the game between the characters  create friction in the characters but the characters have a shared goal. I would rather do this with character motives and character archetypes but I like the idea of creating some friction and having a shared goal. Instead of having chance determine  whether the group achieve that goal or not like in Ben's game, I would rather some skill be involved (I.e. overcoming a set of obstacles and eventually reaching the goal) like a typical role playing game. <br/><br/>I like and Fate Core that you can create an advantage by putting an  situation aspect on the environment or another character. For example, I like the idea that you could create a move that hurt somebody physically, mentally, or socially  and that this could give you a bonus on a future role against them. For example, by throwing sand in someone's face you could put the situation aspect of wind it up on them blind it up on them  situation aspect of blinded up on them blinded up on them, this could give you an advantage on your next attack say. But more importantly would be social and mental aspects; for example, you could seek to humiliate someone  and place an aspect on them of humiliated then in your next role you would get a bonus  if you try to provoke them into doing something if the humiliated aspect was relevant to the fiction. I also like that you can create conditions and injuries; for example, you could create long-term things like an aspect that made others distrust them  by having aspects like a liar put on them multiple times or they have a broken arm or the like.  I also like how fate uses harm tracks to handle these things. Of course, all these things would have to be highly modified to fit the game and procedures would likely have to be changed.<br/><br/>I like the general outcomes and risks of rolls in PbtA games;  for example, I like that you can fail, succeed with the cost or complication ( I.e. soft move) Or fail with a significant cost (i.e. hard move).  However, I don't like the list of outcomes, I would rather the outcomes be dependent upon the context of the fiction; for example, if some enemies were chasing you and you were trying to get into a building and close the door: a success would mean  something like you would make it into the building close the door and they would be shut out at least temporarily, success with the cost of complication might mean that some of the enemies made it through the door but you got the door close to the others, and failure with a significant cost might be that the horde came through and was either in a position to attack you or did attack you. But it would all be subjective and contextual and based on the fiction. I also like the use of archetypes in PbtA games but I would handle them differently;  I  would not handle things with moves,  but instead just skill stats and  what gift certain archetypes  bonuses in certain situations. For example, a  Little finger like  archetype might have a bonus when trying to provoke an emotion against an enemy to create a situation aspect on the character, they might also have a bonus when trying to convince an NPC to conspire against another NPC...perhaps the game FateLess  which is a version of fate without a GM would be worth looking at. <br/><br/>Anyway, I'm out of time and have to go to work. thank you for your help, please ask me any questions to clarify\u2026 I will get back to you after work.

It's a very flexible concept, and very well-suited to GMless gaming (but hard to adapt to player vs. player mechanics).

I definitely think a rotating "GM" might be the way to go for the new game I'm thinking of trying to design.  I have played story games like Microsoft, The Quite Year and Follow...Follow is the only one doing something even remotely similar...I'm just getting into Story Games and GMless games (even though I have a big library) but I really like them...the good news is that I play a new one every other week with my gaming club (we switch between RPGs and Story Games and mostly do one shots) so I will be learning more about this stuff. I might be best to start reading and playing more Story Games but I would like to explore ideas in the meantime...if you have some games you think would be useful I can put them on the schedule...Black of Dispair, White of Lust may be useful but admittedly with the new time constraints that came into my life a few months ago it is going super slow and has taken a back seat to other stuff.

I think one of the games I need to start with is FateLess... when you say that people are responsible for one character and that other things shouldn't interfere in a GMless Story game you are on point... people are primarily responsible for one character and maybe this works in an RPG but not a story game\u2026 Perhaps I need to delve further into  these type of games before I set my goals of what I want my game to do\u2026 After all, even though I have two versions of the game it doesn't mean they have to have the same goals or work exactly the same way\u2026 Thanks David :-)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458541">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458541/#Comment_458541" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-04T04:51:39+00:00" title="December  4, 2016  4:51AM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 4, 2016 4:53AM by David_Berg.">edited December 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I were going to run GoT as inspired by Microscope and (from what I know of it) Quiet Year, the main characters would be the Houses and play would be about tracking their rising and falling fortunes over time, zooming in on key moments and individuals as needed.

Do you think this is a matter of the way the games describe themselves? For example, Lady Blackbird describes itself as a Story Game but people voted for it on the favorite RPG post and not on the favorite Story Game post, so it seems like there is at least a popular conception beyond how games label themselves? Anyway, not to belabor the point and this will be my last question on the subject being that this is off topic, but do to think their is a popular conception?

The core idea is that the player characters are very much <i>competing</i> with each other, even while they're not struggling <i>against</i> each other. This is an entirely normal set-up in many sports and such, and also in some roleplaying games. <i>Agon</i> is another obvious example of a D&amp;D variant that explicitly forefronts the inter-character competition (although it has a GM).<br/><br/>(Also, speaking in GNS terms, this is still totally Gamist all the way, no partiality involved. Gamism as a creative mechanism is much more varied and subtle than people often give it credit for.)<br/><br/>So we've got the following tools/ideas to build with:<br/><b>*</b> Rotating GM: we don't need to use him all the time and for all purposes, note. He just might be useful at times. For example, you could have players provide adversity functions for others in situations where they would otherwise be largely sidelined, because their own characters are not involved.<br/><b>*</b> Point-buy intrigue: characters can "do stuff" in secret from other players by the player paying for the privilege.<br/><b>*</b> Competitive/Cooperative Gamism: the player characters are not for the most part in a zero-sum conflict against each other; rather, the key conflicts in the game are NPC-derived, and victories are joint victories against adversity, or achieving dominant stature among the PCs by exceeding the accomplishments of others. Very much the same as normal D&amp;D, all in all.<br/><br/>The game I see in this works something like so:<br/><b>1)</b> The players create a playing field for the scenario cooperatively, or get it prefab from the game designer. The "playing field", this being an intrigue scenario, consists largely of social mapping: who are the power players, what are their goals, what are their pre-existing relationships.<br/><b>2)</b> Player characters are either already inserted in the scenario, or the players create them, depending on the particulars of the game. The PCs are ostensibly on the same side for the most part, but the game does not mandate this <i>structurally</i>, and there are uncertainties (secret orders in prefab PCs, or random/arbitrary elements in chargen), which means that the PCs do not trust each other quite implicitly. A good idea often seen in similar cooperative boardgames might be the "Traitor" - the players know that almost everybody is fundamentally on the same side, but they also know that <i>somebody</i> is not.<br/><b>3)</b> The players start maneuvering, which might be regulated in terms of turns or fictional resources (time, money, etc.) or whatever suits the game best.<br/>\xa0\xa0<b>a)</b> Each maneuver consists of public and private elements. The public element is what your character is <i>ostensibly</i> doing (visiting relatives, partying, going to church, participating in a state function whatever), while the private element is something you may wish to <i>actually</i> achieve (form secret connections, activate agents, spy/rob/murder somebody, whatever).<br/>\xa0\xa0<b>b)</b> Either, both or neither of the character's maneuver elements may be effective in some way: your public appearance may have great political implications, for example, or your seemingly suspicious visit to a brother may be just that and nothing more. There might be rules mechanics that derive from a character's willpower stat or whatever, in fact, and mandate that the player insert a certain amount of "meaningless" activity in his character's maneuvering.<br/>\xa0\xa0<b>c)</b> The players can, should they wish, spy upon and watch for each other's activities. Presumably dice rolls and such tell us whether intelligence operations are effective. As a result a PC might capture another's secrets by e.g. witnessing their secret tryst.<br/>\xa0\xa0<b>d)</b> The "secret reality" that forms over time basically consists of events and facts that individual players know about, but the rest of the group does not. The trick to consoling these with each other is that "secret facts" only have probable confidence levels as long as they have not been brought into light. For example, you might <i>think</i> that you killed someone in secret earlier, but if another operator was secretly protecting them, the reality of the situation may only become clear once the body (or living person) is produced in public. The rules mechanics resolve conflicts between contesting realities, obviously.<br/><b>4)</b> Because there is no GM providing hard and dynamic resistance from NPCs, the players take turns doing so, or the system mandates them to do so communally on occasion. This is probably directed and curtailed by a sort of a point-buy system as well; for example, each important NPC might have an "adversity value" that the current GM player expends to produce complications. It is probably not worthwhile to simulate NPC intrigue in any great detail; rather, the NPC actions produce "disruptive wedges", events that force the PCs to adapt their plans and take risks.<br/><b>5)</b> The game probably benefits from some sort of an exhausting resource spiral; once the resources are exhausted and the social situation stultifies (no more significant moves are possible because the new king was already crowned, or whatever) the scenario comes to an end, with the player characters ending up more or less satisfied depending on their success in primary and secondary goals.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458550">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458550/#Comment_458550" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-04T07:57:55+00:00" title="December  4, 2016  7:57AM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome <a href="/forums/profile/Eero">@Eero</a>, thank you for all your help in the huge write up.

It would be mostly collaborative, but there would be times where players could be competitive.

Whether it would be about the story or within the story is more complicated. It would be almost entirely from within the story but as soon as you start some procedure where players are negotiating a scene there is some out of story stuff happening, but this negotiation would be about the content of what is within the story.

Intriguing is tough work, the players will have their hands full just intriguing on their own behalf.<br/><br/>So what you'll likely want to do is, you approximate NPC intrigue instead of actually doing it. You still have full mapping of the terrain (social terrain in this case: customs, relationships, political issues, whatnot), and a full record of what the PCs do in the scenario, but instead of keeping track of everything NPCs do, you abstract most of their activities into dice rolls.<br/><br/>This is, incidentally, how many wargame-ish rpgs reduce the burden caused by the opposition. D&amp;D has random encounter rolls, for instance: instead of the GM having to track the particular positions of each monster in the dungeon at each time, he simply figures out their frequency, and rolls random encounter checks to see when and what the adventurers encounter. From the perspective of the characters themselves the outcome is about the same, but the method used saves 99% of the work.<br/><br/>Applying that principle to a GMless intrigue game, you don't want to have to keep track of 20 NPCs and what they're doing every day. While this would surely produce the most intricate and dynamic scenario, it's simply too much work, particularly without a GM, to figure out every day whether this is the day the countess realizes her husband's infidelity, or whatever. Much easier to e.g. roll dice every day for an "intrigue event", and maybe the countess' thing comes up at some point, or not.<br/><br/>What this scheme looks like in practice is that the players will have to intrigue against the NPCs actively, which even with the presumption of total NPC passiveness still requires quite a bit of intriguing to get anywhere. Totally passive NPCs would be boring, though, which is why you'll want to get the most bang you can for the attention you put into the NPCs and their actions; you don't want to spend more playtime than you have to in the minute detail of how the NPCs prepare their plots, as that's already what you're doing for the PCs. Instead, you just roll some dice and abstract away the unseen bits of the NPC actions until all that's left is the part that the PCs encounter.<br/><br/>For an example of what I mean here, let's say that the PCs have entered a hostile court under false pretenses so as to spy on enemy royalty in their natural setting. Let's also say that there is a clever cardinal in the court, a NPC who suspects the PCs of nefarious purposes. How are we going to actually conduct the gameplay here? I suggest that the group does not have the time to run "daily actions" (or however player character intrigue is organized) for this cardinal NPC, not with a bunch of player characters to run as well, not to speak of the other NPCs, too. Besides, if the players had to run this NPC in as much detail as they do with the PCs, what would differentiate between the PCs and the NPCs? Wouldn't it just practically be players playing two sides against themselves?<br/><br/>To avoid the difficulties with that, we'll instead use an abstracted system. For the sake of simplicity of example, we could say that there is a 1/6 chance per day that a "major problem" occurs for the PCs. (In a real game the probability would surely depend on what the PCs do as well, of course.) We do not know in advance what that problem will be, but once it has been established that something bad is coming, the players can figure out (probably aided by the rules system) that hey, apparently it's the kindly old cardinal, and hey, it seems that he's been collecting evidence against us, and hey, apparently we're all going to jail now. Note that we never made the decision in advance that the cardinal would start looking for evidence against the PCs, and we never tracked his progress, and so on - we're simply back-projecting this intrigue at the moment it is revealed to the PCs, so as to minimize the workload of tracking NPC activities. We know that the cardinal is doing something with his days, but we don't know what until the proceedings of the game make it necessary for us to find out.<br/><br/>Of course the fact that we never went into the detail of <i>what</i> the cardinal was doing with his days doesn't mean that the PCs couldn't peek: maybe spying upon a NPC could have revealed a covert danger like an impending criminal investigation in advance, allowing the PCs more time to react to it, or derail the investigation in some way. Just like in the above situation, we still do not know about the cardinal's nefarious purpose in advance: we simply invent this particular danger (probably aided by the game system) at the moment when we actually need to answer the question about what the cardinal has been doing on the sly. The answer might as well be something else, though, because nobody is planning the cardinal's activities in advance.<br/><br/>In truth the big, fat question here for me would be why ever would I want to remove the GM from a game like this - having a GM makes all of this so much easier, plus the feeling of having a consistent, antagonistic world operating around the PCs is priceless, and ultimately impossible to replicate with clever GMless tricks. We basically played this game (well, Gamist <i>Paranoia</i>, which is close enough) a year and a half ago in Helsinki, except it was a GM, and it worked excellently; I believe that something similar is possible without the GM as well, but it does require more careful regulation, and it's impossible to achieve quite as much uncertainty and paranoia when the players know that the cardinal isn't <i>really</i> plotting anything before we take a peek and roll the dice and see how things stand.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458559/#Comment_458559" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-04T20:12:19+00:00" title="December  4, 2016  8:12PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 4, 2016 8:20PM by Paul_T.">edited December 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As I said earlier, this is a very ambitious and challenging prospect for a game. I think that, if successful, it might even be truly groundbreaking (and possibly even spawn a new genre of gaming). However, from the "pitch" I still have no idea how it would operate.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I think you have to go to my earlier question:<br/><br/>Who or what provides <i>adversity</i> in this game? What are the players and/or the characters struggling against?<br/><br/>I've seen that come from: a) other players (head-to-head competition), b) a GM (or a rotating GM position), or c) the system itself. a) is a competitive boardgame, b) is a relatively traditional RPG, and c) is a cooperative boardgame or puzzle. (Are there other options?)<br/><br/>My own design efforts often concern merging or combining those factors in different ways. For instance, in my game <i>Land of Nodd</i>, the players collaborate to create each others' stories, but are rewarded for doing so well by gaining resources they can use to give their characters a better chance of success. The adversity a character faces is provided mechanically by the system, but given life (in fictional terms) by other players. There also a tacit competitive element, however, where players who reach their goals earlier make it harder for those who follow them.<br/><br/>Some more ideas:<br/><br/>* One way to establish sufficient "distance" for players to act as adversity for other players is to keep the stories of the various PCs separate.<br/><br/>If you're trying to overtake the throne in King's Landing, but my character is away in Slaver's Bay, I'll find it much easier to provide "impartial" input to your character's storyline. <br/><br/>The more separate they are, the easier this is to do. When they start to merge (e.g. both our characters now are jockeying for the throne), you have to design very carefully, and introduce procedures or mechanism which allow the players to navigate some awkward tradeoffs. (In <i>Land of Nodd</i>, it's accomplished by opposition players a) not having any mechanical input into resolution, and b) being rewarded in terms or resources when they do a good job.)<br/><br/>* David Berg has a game coming out called <i>Within My Clutches</i>. It features a "secret master plan" for each character, which is revealed at the end of the game. It works well because it has little bearing on the mechanics of the game (so we have no cause to bicker about it), and all the players are on the same side about it: we want to support each other in developing this plan, and hope to see it revealed at the end.<br/><br/>The clever thing he has in his game is a mechanic where we get to find out a little bit about the plan at certain points. For instance, if I get a certain number of points, I get to ask you to reveal certain elements of your plan.<br/><br/>It works largely because it's not a competitive game, though, note.<br/><br/>* Eero's idea of having an overt agenda and a covert agenda is pretty interesting. I could even see a system where a player declares an overt goal, but also prepares a secret goal (as Eero suggests). Meanwhile, however, his opposition (another player, or maybe the group in toto) prepares a secret "consequence" to his actions.<br/><br/>Some kind of resolution process then tells us:<br/><br/>-Which outcomes take place, and which do not.<br/>-What the immediate outcome of the scene is (does the overt agenda succeed? - possibly the least important or interesting part here, but it could be if it has repercussions on future actions).<br/>-Which outcomes are revealed, and which remain secret.<br/>-Which parties or players are given access to that information.<br/>-Possibly: which information is public knowledge *in the fiction*, and which is not<br/><br/>For instance, we might find that:<br/><br/>-Celia's visit to the Temple ends in an argument, and she is thrown out, earning a bad relationship with the Temple (overt outcome). <br/>-This is public knowledge at the table (all the players know, of course), but secret in the fiction (the people in  the City have not heard about it, at least not yet).<br/>-Celia's covert goal (to slip a bribe to the head priest) was successful, and all the players know this.<br/>-Celia's actions have a player-authored repercussion, which is that the Temple will start hiring assassins, disguised as priests. This is known to the other players, but not Celia.<br/><br/>This could be an interesting position to design a game from. You'd have to be very careful about the possible outcomes to avoid game-breaking combinations (like something happening but no players being aware of it).<br/><br/>* Your best friend in design for this kind of game, in my opinion, is <i>balanced mechanical tradeoffs</i>.<br/> <br/>If you can create balanced decisions - so that either way you choose is interesting, and doesn't screw someone over - you don't have to worry as much about who is making the decision and whether they have a bias.<br/><br/>For instance, you cannot have two players competing with each other for victory, and then give one the authority to decide how challenging the other's tasks are (e.g. the "difficulty number" for their rolls). But if you add in a counterbalancing incentive, you can sometimes make it work. For instance:<br/><br/>-When your character tries to do something challenging, every other player decides whether they think it's Hard or Easy. For every player who says it's Hard, your chances of success drop. However, if you succeed, for every player who said it was Hard, you score one point. These points are how we win the game, or get bonuses to future actions, or something similar (experience points, Pool dice, new abilities, more resources you can use to make MY life more difficult, etc). <br/><br/>I do something like this in <i>Musette</i>, where I want balanced conflicts, but also for players to take sides in the conflicts. In <i>Musette</i>, your desired outcome is to win the conflict, but against as much opposition as possible (the more cards against you, the more it contributes to you winning the game).<br/><br/>This means that a player has an incentive to contribute both towards and against one of her goals. Player goals are secret, which also contributes to an interest in "hiding" one's motives by contributing evenly to various "sides" in conflict.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458560">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458560/#Comment_458560" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-04T20:18:51+00:00" title="December  4, 2016  8:18PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 4, 2016 8:22PM by Paul_T.">edited December 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As for "story game", I think you won't find any kind of common definition. Eero is on the ball about this one: it depends on the particular "crowd" using the term.<br/><br/>Personally, I use "story game" as an umbrella term for any game which deals with the imagination and seeks to create a narrative. An RPG, then, is a subset of "story game" (although I can imagine some RPGs which I would hesitate to call 'story games', if they are really not interested in creating a coherent narrative).<br/><br/>A lot of other people, though, like to use "story game" as a subset of RPGs: roleplaying games which focus on "the story" more so than they focus on each person's character and their advancement. <br/><br/>Some people consider "story game" to be a design movement (originally referred to as "indie games", but now that term seems silly, with so many games on the market being published independently). In that case, we look for certain design features and say "hey, that has Character Issues and it's GMless, so I say it's a story game!" In this, much like with pornography, you won't be able to draw strict lines, but any given person can easily say, "I know one when I see one!"<br/><br/>In some parts of the "trad RPG world", "story game" or "narrative gaming" are pejorative terms used to lump together new games not to the liking of a particular community. The term is used, then, to distinguish "games I don't like" from "real RPGs". For some people, this goes so far as to label a sinister conspiracy which seeks to <i>destroy gaming for everyone</i>...<br/><br/>The latter two groups sometimes use the term in what I can only consider a sort of <i>political</i> sense: to label something as part of a group I like or dislike.<br/><br/>(Has anyone seen other uses of the term? I think those four categories roughly cover usage I've encountered.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458562">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458562/#Comment_458562" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-04T20:57:20+00:00" title="December  4, 2016  8:57PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>Is it so a group can play without requiring anyone to take on that big responsibility of being The GM?<br/><br/>Definitely.<br/><br/>Is it so everyone gets to share in the fun of establishing setting and NPCs?<br/><br/>Definitely.</blockquote>Cool.  This sounds doable to me!  I might start with the regular, GMed game, and just look for the most easy and fun ways to divide those GM responsibilities.<br/><br/>\u2022 Do people take turns being The GM?  Does that rotate, or do you just pick from whichever players don't have their characters on screen?  Is there always one GM, or always two, or something else?<br/><br/>\u2022 Do people retain some GM duties throughout play?  Maybe you're the rules guy and I'm the NPCs guy and Fred's the authority on the setting's politics and Jenn's the authority on the supernatural?<br/><br/>\u2022 Are most GM decisions made in committee, or by vote, or point-buy, or auction?<br/><br/>Just some random brainstorms...<br/><br/>Working more from scratch might be better in some ways.  I guess it depends on what motivates and inspires you!\n<blockquote>It would have to contain both collaborative and competitive features to work. It would be mostly collaborative, but there would be times where players could be competitive. There would have to be agreement about outcomes even if those outcomes where "good" for one player and "bad" for another, but mostly the players would be working together. Whether it would be about the story or within the story is more complicated. It would be almost entirely from within the story but as soon as you start some procedure where players are negotiating a scene there is some out of story stuff happening, but this negotiation would be about the content of what is within the story.</blockquote>That sounds really hard to me.  If that is central to your vision, then by all means pursue it!  But if it's just something you're kinda maybe considering... I'd wait on that and hope to nail some easier design specs first.</blockquote>\nYes, it sounds difficult and IMO even my GM version has created tremendous challenges.<br/><br/>What about this, I drop the PVP elements. I have a rotating "GM" who creates the scene based on the PCs relationship with the NPCs, past fictional elements, and creativity, with the goal being scenes that create conflict and drama. However, when the direction that a scene is going to take is not obvious, I have a deck of cards with promts such as "Create a social or physical conflict with an NPC" or "Create an NPC secret" and the like ( I could continue to develop and refine these prompts during play testing). To create an NPC secret I could have one of the players play the "Secret Keeper," they could create an off screen secret for an NPC that they would imagine based on a past scene (or if there was no past scene to help guide the creation of a secret they could invented one at least consistent with the fiction). For example, perhaps in a passing the PCs were conspiring with other NPCs, the "Secret Keeper" would create an off screen scene in their mind; in this example, s/he could create an off screen scene in which another NPC  overheard they're conspiring. Another example, could be if a PC had searched an NPC's room in the past and successfully found some  information which they could use against the NPC, the "Secret keeper" could  create an off screen scene and their imagination that the PC necklace had broken it slipped off into the NPC's dresser drawer while the PC was searching; this would create a secret where the NPC knew that the PC have been in the room.  The "secret keeper" would create these in their imagination write them down; they would play their character  as though they did not know the NPC secret. Whenever a scene was being GMed by another player and the fiction need to be adjusted based on the secret or an NPC need to be rewarded a bonus based on the secret,  The "secret keeper" could intervene and slightly change the fiction or say to add a bonus with revealing as little as possible. One wouldn't overdo secrets because the bookkeeping and scene adjustments wouldn't be worth it;  A better alternative might be to rotate "the secret keeper" based on whoever drew the "create a secret card", this way everyone  would share duties and nobody would know all the secrets, which wouldn't be fun for the secret keeper.

But I'd really want to structure the game to make that true.  Playing out an ignorant character while you know what's up but other players don't -- this sounds like a weird headspace to me, somewhere in between immersion and distant co-authoring.  Sounds fragile.\n<blockquote>One wouldn't overdo secrets because the bookkeeping and scene adjustments wouldn't be worth it</blockquote>If bookkeeping's a nuisance and/or scene adjustments are minimal, then people might not bother at all!

That might sound like being The GM, but I think it'd be completely different -- able to potentially interject at any time, but never in charge of "running" a given scene.  Still, every group would need someone who'd enjoy that -- might be just as hard as finding a GM, or harder!  I dunno.  I'd try being Secret Keeper -- jotting notes while everyone else talks, then chiming in with surprises at key moments -- but I'm weird.  Maybe giving the Secret Keeper a game-like goal, something like maximizing PC actions made under false impressions, would help.  Or maybe the Secret Keeper could "bet" on one or all of the noble Houses involved.<br/><br/>I don't like the idea of a sole Secret Keeper with a PC, though.<br/><br/>As for rotating Secret Keepers, that makes sense to me, especially if I'm coming up with secrets that don't impact my PC and you're coming up with secrets that don't impact your PC, etc.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458564">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458564/#Comment_458564" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-04T22:09:39+00:00" title="December  4, 2016 10:09PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 4, 2016 10:11PM by David_Berg.">edited December 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Has anyone seen other uses of the term?</blockquote>Sure.

At its core is a conflict resolution system of dice vs. dice, and the winner dictates the consequences to the loser. However, there are only three possibilities: two are mechanical (dice penalties) and one is freeform. That is, you can negotiate something that happens in the fiction, but if you can't come to an agreement about that, you have to fall back to one of the two mechanical penalties (winner chooses which one). It's a carrot-or-stick negotiation.<br/><br/>Also <i>Polaris.</i> Polaris rotates specific GM responsibilities with specific players (based on player seating arrangements) during each scene. <br/><br/>Somewhere there is a list of roles or responsibilities that GMs often take on; it would behoove you to look at that list and decide if specific responsibilities are concentrated in one person at a time, or everyone shares them. Specialization makes sure that someone is thinking about the things that need to be thought about, rather than just assuming that <i>someone</i> is thinking about it.<br/><br/><i>The Shab-al-Hiri Roach</i> is a GMless PVP game. Like many of the story games of the early 2000's, it's a "scenes and stakes" game. The spotlight player puts a goal out there for the scene and the rest of the players bid coins for or against it. Winners double their bid out of the kitty; losers forfeit their bid to the kitty. This seems a fruitful ground for some kind of resource management for your game.<br/><br/><i>Annalise</i> is a GMless game, but it isn't PVP usually. It's usually a group of people cooperating to notice and ultimately defeat an evil stalker of some kind (ostensibly, a Vampire). One of the really cool things it does is bring multiple stakes to each scene. The player might want Stake A; the player's temporary GM (each scene has a "story guide") adds Stake B; another player adds Stake C; a fourth player adds Stake D. Then you roll 1d6 for each Stake and assign a die to each one. Basically, a high number means the stake will come to be, and a low number means the stake will not come to be (not exactly, but go with this for ease of understanding). Then the spotlight player struggles to fiddle with each of the dice, spending game currency to tweak a die up or down a point or trust to fate and reroll it. But the other players fiddle with the stake dice, too! This really forces you to 1) take some bad things with the good, and 2) decide what is the most important thing to you. In case it's not obvious, each of the stakes must be able to come true independently ("orthogonal" stakes).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458571">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458571/#Comment_458571" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-05T20:03:07+00:00" title="December  5, 2016  8:03PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 5, 2016 8:10PM by Jeff_B_Slater.">edited December 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi everyone,<br/><br/>I have come up with a very coherent and workable solution for the game and have created all of the procedures/mechanics in entirety, I believe, to make the game work as intended. The game is a little different than what is described above and has more Story Game elements but it retains a lot of what I want and will work much better and be a more elegant solution. Let me describe my definition of a Story Game so you have an idea of what I'm talking about:<br/><br/>I think about a Story Game as a game in which the players tell a story together collaboratively in a story-first sort of way, rather than having the main goal be singular-character POV emersion, with no one having too much more control or authority than another. This doesn't mean that there can't be roles in a Story Game just that story comes first. To me a Story Game also usually contains, to a certain extent, elements "about" the story rather than elements from "within" the story, at least more than a RPG typically does. If that makes sense. <br/><br/>I will do a write up of all the rules and examples tonight or in the next day or two. I will ask some specific questions to see if people can come up examples to add to certain prompts in the game, and if anyone thinks they may have some ideas to improve the game.<br/><br/>I want to thank you all for the help and wonderful ideas you have given me. You have made me think a lot, helped me to figure out what exactly it is I want, helped me to thing about problems that might arise in certain designs, and helped me to think about how to achieve the procedures and mechanisms to bring about what I want.
