Check this out; it's the pre-genned character history worksheet for the game of SOTC I'm running on Saturday. I love how SOTC makes you create the characters' back stories during chargen and build them into each character's interconnected history. Love, love, love.\n<blockquote>CHARACTER HISTORY WORKSHEET<br/><br/>PRE-WAR BACKGROUND. Rex Rich is trust-fund baby from Hub City, New Jersey, with a banker father and socialite mother, educated in a series of boarding and prep schools, where he achieves notoriety as the ringleader of a daredevil schoolboy clique. Dr. Einstein reshapes man\xe2\u20ac\u2122s understanding of physical reality in 1905 and accepts academic positions, first in Zurich and then in Berlin. Snap Redstone is born and raised on a farm in Iowa; his older brother Jack leaves home, spending time with the circus and as a boxer before finding himself in Paris driving a taxi-cab. Tan-Gliil is on Mars, foraging amid its cold ruins.<br/><br/>REX RICH\tBrains Behind This Outfit; A Dangerous Game<br/>JACK REDSTONE\tCheckered Past; American in Paris<br/>SNAP REDSTONE\tFarm Boy; A Letter From Jack<br/>Dr. EINSTEIN\tSwiss Passport; e=mc2<br/>TAN-GLIIL\tRed Martian; Foraging in the Ruins<br/><br/>WAR. Rex Rich drops out of Princeton to enter a series of French aviation contests, which are canceled with the outbreak of war. He joins the French Foreign Legion, where he meets newly enlisted Jack Redstone. They see action together as infantry before transfering to the French flying corps. As armored biplane pilots of the Lafayette Escadrille, they fight the Kaiser\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Kriegzeppelins in the air above Verdun, and watch Dreifusspanzers go head-to-head with Bensalemite land leviathans at Cambrai. Snap is a high school student in Iowa, building model rockets in the old barn and running track and field. Albert Einstein\xe2\u20ac\u2122s intellectual reputation continues to grow as he speaks out against the war and militarism, but he grows increasingly estranged from his wife Mileva. Tan-Gliil is captured by Black Martians and indoctrinated by their mental compulsion techniques.<br/><br/>REX RICH\tWar Hero; Jack Redstone Saved My Life<br/>JACK REDSTONE\tZeppelin Killer; Snap\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Just A Kid!<br/>SNAP REDSTONE\tA Little Too Much Juice; Tried Out for Varsity<br/>Dr. EINSTEIN\tFight for Peace; Ein Schlacht mit die Frau<br/>TAN-GLIIL\tMind-Slave of Mars; Gladiator of Mars<br/><br/>DR. EINSTEIN: AGAINST THE FUTURIANS! In 1919, convalescing from illness, Dr. Einstein (accompanied by his new wife Elsa) joins astronomer Sir Arthur Eddington and millionaire Rex Rich en route to the island of Principe to observe the solar eclipse that may provide conclusive evidence of his theory of relativity. They are overtaken by the Futurian science-dreadnought New Atlantis, whose captain wants Dr. Einstein for his crew. Rich is nabbed when he disguises himself as Einstein, and the Greatest Mind of All Time must match wits with the wily Admiral Tirsano aboard the New Atlantis to save him\xe2\u20ac\u201dif barnstorming pilot Jack Redstone can get him there in time!<br/><br/>REX RICH\tPrisoner of the Futurians; Einstein, You\xe2\u20ac\u2122re A Genius<br/>JACK REDSTONE\tYou Can Count Me In<br/>SNAP REDSTONE\t--\t--<br/>Dr. EINSTEIN\tThe Greatest Mind of All Time!; Elsa, meine Schnitzel<br/>TAN-GLIIL\t--\t--<br/><br/> <br/>TAN-GLIIL in REBEL OF MARS. Odwar Tan-Gliil and his padwar (wingman) Tel-Janru are sent on a mission to destroy a Red Martian rebel redoubt. When the \xe2\u20ac\u0153redoubt\xe2\u20ac\x9d turns out to be a peaceful village, Tan-Gliil resists his conditioning--but Tel-Janru does not. The village is destroyed, and Tan-Gliil vows to destroy the Black Martians and their Warlord. His one-man rebellion takes him across Mars until, pursued by the Warlord\xe2\u20ac\u2122s forces, he makes a desperate bid for escape through the ancient Time Gate hidden on Phobos by the mysterious Precursors.<br/><br/>REX RICH\t--\t--<br/>JACK REDSTONE\t--\t--<br/>SNAP REDSTONE\t--\t--<br/>Dr. EINSTEIN\t--\t--<br/>TAN-GLIIL\tGet Out of My Mind!; One Against Mars<br/><br/>REX RICH in THE MILLION-DOLLAR MARTIAN MANHUNT. When a Martian flying saucer crashlands in the New Jersey barrens, aviation pioneer Rex Rich accepts a million dollar wager from Admiral Belknap, head of the Raritanic Naval Arsenal, that he can get it flying again. After a brief misunderstanding, Jack Redstone manages to befriend Tan-Gliil, the Man from Mars, and with a little help from Dr. Einstein, the prize money seems within Rex\xe2\u20ac\u2122s grasp\xe2\u20ac\u201dbut what does Admiral Belknap really intend to do with a flying saucer?<br/><br/>BONUS STORY: We meet young Snap Redstone for the first time as he wipes the goofy grin off his rival Tom \xe2\u20ac\u0153Go-Bird\xe2\u20ac\x9d Goddard\xe2\u20ac\u2122s face by winning the Young Rocketeer contest!<br/><br/>REX RICH\tWealthy Aviation Entrepreneur; Admiral Belknap<br/>JACK REDSTONE\t--\tA Man From Mars?<br/>SNAP REDSTONE\tYoung Rocketeer of America; Dang That Go-Bird Goddard!<br/>Dr. EINSTEIN\tA Little Thought-Experiment; Physics Is Universal<br/>TAN-GLIIL\tStranger In A Strange Land\t--<br/><br/>THE REDSTONE BROS. AND THE ISLAND OF HORRORS.  When their rocket-plane crashes on a volcanic South Pacific island, Snap races against time to repair the damage to the Silverhawk 5 before the volcano blows its top. But how can the Silverhawk blast off when its pilot is captured by cannibals? Luckily, Tan-Gliil is along for the ride\xe2\u20ac\u201dwill his ingenuity and fighting skills be enough to free Jack before he becomes a sacrificial groom to the volcano goddess?<br/><br/>REX RICH\t--\t--<br/>JACK REDSTONE\tI\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll Have A Look; Hang On!<br/>SNAP REDSTONE\tA Few More Adjustments; The Southern Cross<br/>Dr. EINSTEIN\t--\t--<br/>TAN-GLIIL\tMan or Martian?; Wanderlust<br/><br/>THE REDSTONE BROS.

The Redstones are counting on the new Silverhawk 7 to get the job done, but when the Futurians send a beautiful double agent to work her wiles on Jack, only Dr. Einstein's advanced calculations can get the Silverhawk flying before the Futurians beat them to it!<br/><br/>REX RICH\tI\xe2\u20ac\u2122m Paying You--Just Make It Fly; That\xe2\u20ac\u2122s A Risk I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m Willing To Take<br/>JACK REDSTONE\tWhat Are We Waiting For?; Sofia Hagios, Beautiful &amp; Deadly<br/>SNAP REDSTONE\tSilverhawk 7, Moon Rocket; Walking On The Moon<br/>Dr. EINSTEIN\tLectures at Princeton; God Does Not Play Dice<br/>TAN-GLIIL\t--\tData Crystals</blockquote>\nSo, if you'd signed up for this game--who would you want to play, and why?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81683">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason" title="Joe_Beason"><img alt="Joe_Beason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason">Joe_Beason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81683/#Comment_81683" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-17T09:35:52+00:00" title="July 17, 2007  9:35AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All the concepts are very clear.  <br/><br/>Dr. Einstein is the most appealing to me, though I'm not clear on how some of his Aspects would work in play, namely Ein Schlacht mit die Frau, Lectures at Princeton and God Does Not Play Dice.

Good comments. Some brainstorming:<br/><br/>Compel Ein Schlacht with die Frau to have ex-wife Mileva show up and make trouble for Dr. Einstein, demanding time or money from him ("Our sons need their father!") or even merely to trouble Einstein with the memory of some of her accusations ("You know I'm the one who did all those calculations for you! You'd be nothing without me!") when he's making an important Science roll, gaining a Fate point for accepting a penalty to the roll. Tag Ein Schlacht mit die Frau to, I dunno, resist the wiles of a Mata Hari-like female secret agent.<br/><br/>Compel Lectures at Princeton to remind Dr. Einstein of the impertinent science questions asked in that venue by a young Snap Redstone, and thus motivating Dr. Einstein to put the young rascal in his place; tag Lectures at Princeton to aid a Contacting roll because a particular target was in the audience, and was duly impressed with Einstein's acumen and brilliance.<br/><br/>Tan-Gliil is harder; you're right that he's a fish out of water until and unless the adventure takes the characters to Mars. I think this gives the player a lot of room to decide what angle to take (melancholy pilgrim? vengeful exile?), but it's not clear from the write-up. I'll have to make the need for a strong player choice clear when folks are picking characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81982">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81982/#Comment_81982" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-18T08:18:26+00:00" title="July 18, 2007  8:18AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is interesting in that... it's just not interesting, to me.
