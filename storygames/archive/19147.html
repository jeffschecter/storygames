Getting them to ask usually involves putting something at stake, hinging on the answer.<br/><br/>Example:<br/><br/><b>Secret:</b> the mayor is a vampire!<br/><b>Answer:</b> the mayor has been ordering the police to bring derelicts into a secret facility so he can feed on them cuz he's a vampire!<br/><b>Question:</b> why have the police been bringing derelicts into a secret facility?<br/><b>Stake:</b> we've been tasked by our spooky boss with finding out the truth behind the facility; or a missing derelict is a friend of ours; or our reporter buddy disappeared investigating this story; or something.<br/><br/>Once the stake is set and the question is raised, you can speed or slow pacing by putting all the answers in one place or several.  <i>"You sneak into the facility and see the mayor feeding"</i> is fast and centralized, while <i>interrogating or spying on various cops to figure out where the orders are coming from and who's seen what at the facility</i> is slow and spread out.  If the game is going slow and the PCs are talking to a cop, have that cop implicate the mayor.  If the games is going fast and the PCs are talking to a cop, have that cop implicate the mayor's aide.<br/><br/>All this is my take based on the premise in the initial post -- that it's up to the GM's judgment when to reveal the GM's secrets.  If you wind up not loving that, there are alternatives.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JoshDemers" title="JoshDemers"><img alt="JoshDemers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/703/nLX7QIP4KZECH.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JoshDemers">JoshDemers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427199/#Comment_427199" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-15T17:39:38+00:00" title="January 15, 2014  5:39PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's helpful, David, thank you.

These are all interesting and surprising truths, which most people do not know (like that the mayor is vampire, why not).<br/><br/>In play, when the players pursue some knowledge about these secrets, do not hold back. Let each attempt to learn something give as much information as would be reasonable in that situation: if they investigate the mayor's bathroom, they'll see that there's no mirror there. If they visit his bedroom in the middle of the night, they'll see him dining on a victim. If they ask him directly, he reacts in a very powerful way, denies everything, and has them arrested. And so on: obvious clues, obvious consequences.<br/><br/>But, for each secret, figure out how revealing it or acting on it would have major repercussions. For instance, maybe the mayor is responsible for supporting a PC's sister's hospital, and without his help it will collapse or be bought by the mafia. Or he is responsible for holding back the forces of evil. Or maybe it's just a matter of having the other potential mayor be an enemy of the PCs.<br/><br/>So, the players will get the secrets easily (from your perspective; for them it will feel like hard, but exciting and rewarding work, since it'll still require a scene or so for each major clue or piece of information they uncover, and they'll properly get into some trouble or some adventures in the process). <br/><br/>But with each secret they learn, they will face a difficult choice:<br/><br/>* If they reveal that secret or act on it, there will be significant consequences.<br/><br/>Now the game gets interesting, I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427361">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JoshDemers" title="JoshDemers"><img alt="JoshDemers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/703/nLX7QIP4KZECH.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JoshDemers">JoshDemers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427361/#Comment_427361" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-17T17:16:37+00:00" title="January 17, 2014  5:16PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks.

(getting the scooby doo thing)<br/><br/>Character insights like moves in aw keep the game moving. But do your players like that type of play (mata) if that makes sense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
