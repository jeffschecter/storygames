I am all but confirmed for my application to be a Judge Nominee and would like to know if there are any questions people might have about me.<br/><br/>Here is the bio that I expect will soon be posted on the ENnie webste:<br/><br/>Hi! My name is Mark Causey. I've been roleplaying for about 11 years<br/>now. I've bounced between traditional games (Marvel FASERIP, D&amp;D (1st<br/>Edition - 3.5), Vampire) to 'indie' games (Primetime Adventures, The<br/>Shadow of Yesterday, Shab-al-Hiri Roach). I'm also into Japanese RPGs<br/>(Tenra Bansho Zero, Alshard ff, Double X Cross).<br/><br/>I feel that I can provide a fresh mindset to the Awards. I will<br/>honestly play any kind of RPG once I know what kind of fun the authors<br/>want to provide (which is hard to ascertain, sometimes). I believe<br/>that any game book or supplement, if written from the point of view of<br/>the fun that occurred from actual play, can be a good purchase. My<br/>philosophy on gaming is based on getting my group excited and having<br/>fun, using the best system for the concept we want to play. I think I<br/>can help award those authors and companies for their efforts based on<br/>that philosophy.<br/><br/>So, ask your questions! I will try to keep up. Also, other SG Judge Nominees feel free to make any comments you want. This isn't my pulpit.                </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>OK, just got back from vacation and I'm trying to understand this all, so I'll drop a few questions for any interested judges:<br/><br/>1) Why do you want to be a judge for the Ennies?<br/></blockquote>
My RPG reviewing is very important to me, I take a lot of pride out of it.  This is a natural way to take that to the next level, allowing me to further refine my craft.  It's not as cool as all the talented folk who produce the RPGs I love, but it's important to me.
<blockquote><br/>2) What do you think of the importance of the Ennies?<br/></blockquote>
I think that, like reviews, that bring attention to products.  Being made more aware of a broader variety of products is a wonderful thing, and I think it helps draw folk deeper into the hobby.  They generate discussion about these products, and so I think they're important and useful but I wouldn't run out and buy a game just because it won an ENnie.  I would take a look at it online, however.
<blockquote><br/>3) What was the most fun you had gaming last year in a single session? Give details, and tell us briefly why.<br/></blockquote>
Probably a game of Faery's Tale I ran that ended up being a lot of fun, largely because all the players seemed to buy into the game and got into the habit of contributing their own ideas as the tale came together.  Here's a link to the actual play for that session: <a href="http://cwricheson.livejournal.com/tag/actual+play" rel="nofollow">http://cwricheson.livejournal.com/tag/actual+play</a>
<blockquote><br/>4) About how often do you actually play games (not just read them)? What's your split of doing GMing to Playing?<br/></blockquote>
Between 5 and 10 hours a week, depending on if I'm participating in one or two games.  In the last three months it's been 5, but on the whole 10 has been more common.  I GM the vast majority of the time, largely because the games I most want to play tend to be less well known and more difficult to find games for.
<blockquote><br/>5) If you were like one of those "Nobilis Gods" that only controlled one aspect of the universe, and that aspect was "RPGs"/"The RPG Market"/"RPGs in General" and the like, and you had the godlike power to influence the world of RPGs (from the way they are written, to how they are received and played, even to the market in general), what would you change about RPGs or 'the market' over the next 3-5 years?<br/></blockquote>
I'd inspire more people to self publish and experiment with game mechanics.  I'd inspire more consumers to buy those games.  I'd make it to where instead of a few RPGs dominating the market RPG stores frequently sold lots of varied RPGs.  I prefer playing new things when I can, and as much as I enjoy a good game of D&amp;D or GURPS what I'd really like is to meet more folk that have a broad interest in RPGs.
<blockquote><br/>6) What's the best 1-3 things that have happened in the world of Roleplaying/Gaming over the past three to five years?<br/></blockquote>
It's back a bit further, but I'd put the d20 movement at 1.  Not because everyone playing the same game is a great thing, but because it seems to have strongly reinvigorated the hobby and brought in a lot more people.  It also showed that an open license could be successful with mainstream RPGs, a concept I hope to see again in the future.  I'd put the continued rise of small press RPG publishing at 2, which has resulted in most of my favorite games.  I also hope that it's the wave of the future, especially with the development of portable PDF readers.  I'd probably say the successful use of licenses for 3.  Buffy, Angel, Stargate, and other licenses have been handled well and have both drawn new people into the hobby and made existing hobbyists more aware of different systems and publishers.
<blockquote><br/>7) What is your favorite gaming-related accessory (could be in general like "This Product X", or even specific, like "My Lucky Pencil")?<br/></blockquote>
I have a big goblet and several treasure chests sitting on my coffee table.  The goblet contains d6s, one chest contains d10s, another contains a dice mix, and the last contains playing cards, tokens, sticky notes, index cards, and other materials.  With a pencil and pen jar next to all of that, I'd say my gaming table generally h as really contributed to a relaxed atmosphere where no one needs to bring anything with them and materials are always close at hand.                        </div>

                            Excellent questions.<br/>
<br/>
<i>1) Why do you want to be a judge for the Ennies?</i><br/>
<br/>
I enjoyed the judging for the last GameChef, I believe in the organisers mission to widen participation in the awards and the best way I can support that is to get involved.<br/>
<br/>
<i>2) What do you think of the importance of the Ennies?</i><br/>
<br/>
The most important thing the ENnies does is to get people talking about gaming, and specifically what makes a good game.<br/>
<br/>
<i>3) What was the most fun you had gaming last year in a single session? Give details, and tell us briefly why.</i><br/>
<br/>
Judd asked a similar in the ENWorld Q&amp;A thread, and Iâ€™m going to repeat the answer I gave him.<br/>
<br/>
Sure thing. This may take a while:<br/>
<br/>
This is from the homebrew campaign Iâ€™ve been playing in for over 10 years. I need to tell you a few things about it, to explain why this moment rocked so much. Firstly, we reset the game a couple of years ago after we lost one of our players. More on that later. We put all of our characters away, tweaked the rules and started in a new area of the map with a new story.<br/>
<br/>
Also, we regular run more than one character at a time, and each player has a â€œstableâ€ of up to half a dozen characters in their folder at any one time. All of the play is based around a single city and the outlying settlements, so parties form and disperse from session to session and many of the characters know each other through former association or by reputation.<br/>
<br/>
So, for the last few sessions weâ€™ve been investigating some attacks on one of the nearby villages, and it looks like weâ€™ve just hit across the advance guard of a sizeable dark elf army (the first time this race has been introduced to the campaign). In the session before this one, we took a party deep into some underground passages, and we ended the session resting in an area we had just cleared out.<br/>
<br/>
This session, weâ€™re taking another party, with different characters, to investigate another dark elf sighting. This also leads to an underground network of caves, and we start getting our butts kicked by some nasty hit-and-run attacks and magic weâ€™ve never seen before.<br/>
<br/>
We press on, and after some more of the same the GM asks us to make some perception checks. He tells us that thereâ€™s a small force just ahead of us, we donâ€™t know what, but they donâ€™t appear to know weâ€™re there. Can you see where this is leading?<br/>
<br/>
At this point, we pretty much realise (as players) that the other force <i>might</i> be<br/>
our party from the last session, weâ€™re underground, lost and weâ€™ve been attacked virtually every inch of the way.<br/>
<br/>
So, naturally, we charge. Straight into the other party.<br/>
<br/>
What happens next is what rocked for me. Recently weâ€™d been a bit protective of our characters; not wanting to take too much risk, getting a bit upset (as players) if anyoneâ€™s character had screwed anyone elseâ€™s character over (with large numbers of characters per player, each with their own agenda, this happens fairly often and is usually accepted as long as no-one kills anyone else).<br/>
<br/>
So weâ€™re in a situation where we may be facing not one, but <i>two</i> total party kills, because the characters in each party donâ€™t know the other party very well and the dark elves have been hiring mercenaries.<br/>
<br/>
Except this time, we go for it. Weâ€™re actively conspiring with each other and with the GM to come up with reasons why the characters might not realise whatâ€™s going on. Weâ€™re attacking each otherâ€™s characters, weâ€™re attacking our <i>own</i> characters, weâ€™re having a blast.<br/>
<br/>
Then the GM tells me that one of my characters, a priest in the second group who has been hanging back (no combat skills) that he recognises some of the guys in the other group and weâ€™re fighting the wrong guys.<br/>
<br/>
What happened next was a different sort of rocking, but it wasnâ€™t as good as what happened when we remembered that weâ€™re playing a <i>game</i>, that itâ€™s OK if things go wrong. <i>Itâ€™s even OK if someone dies. The rest of us will move on.</i><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<i>4) About how often do you actually play games (not just read them)? What's your split of doing GMing to Playing?</i><br/>
<br/>
On average I play once a week, in a regular group. I usually play because a have a friend who is a far better GM than I am and who enjoys it more; I GM occasionally to give him the chance to play, or to run a one-shot game that the group wouldnâ€™t normally get to play.<br/>
<br/>
<i>5) If you were like one of those "Nobilis Gods" that only controlled one aspect of the universe, and that aspect was "RPGs"/"The RPG Market"/"RPGs in General" and the like, and you had the godlike power to influence the world of RPGs (from the way they are written, to how they are received and played, even to the market in general), what would you change about RPGs or 'the market' over the next 3-5 years?</i><br/>
<br/>
There are so many RPG projects out there that havenâ€™t been completed because the writers got discouraged, or couldnâ€™t find the right words to express the awesome ideas they have, or they canâ€™t make the time. Iâ€™d do something about that, maybe cut a deal with the God of Creative Expression.<br/>
<br/>
<i>6) What's the best 1-3 things that have happened in the world of Roleplaying/Gaming over the past three to five years?</i><br/>
<br/>
I agree with Chris that open-sourcing the d20 system is important enough to justify sneaking it into this list. I recognise that lot sof people, many of whom frequent this board are cheerfully sharing their ideas and their mechanics with each other and donâ€™t need a big fat licence to do it â€“ look at all of the Creative Commons stuff coming out. However, the fact that the creators of the largest game in the industry decided it was cool for other people to use their stuff and it was also cool to publish their entire core system as a freely downloadable fileâ€¦ thatâ€™s awesome. It has so much impact on the rest of the industry, in so many ways, nearly all of them good.<br/>
<br/>
The explosion in print on demand and PDF game distribution. This oneâ€™s an easy choice.<br/>
<br/>
World of Warcraft. I know a lot of people think that this is a terrible thing for pen-and-paper RPGs, that people are deserting RPGs in their droves in order to play WoW and other online games. I believe these people are missing the point. If X million people are willing to pay a fee every single month to play a MMORPG, then that game is well designed. It has clear goals, and it is clearly meeting them. It also means that those X million people are enjoying themselves gaming. Above all, it means that the people who arenâ€™t playing WoW and other games all the time are looking for something <i>else</i>, and I think this will have a progressive impact on games design.<br/>
<br/>
<i>7) What is your favorite gaming-related accessory (could be in general like "This Product X", or even specific, like "My Lucky Pencil")?</i><br/>
<br/>
The internet.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

                            &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Posted By: Andy&lt;/cite&gt;OK, just got back from vacation and I'm trying to understand this all, so I'll drop a few questions for any interested judges:<br/>
<br/>
1) Why do you want to be a judge for the Ennies?&lt;quote&gt;<br/>
I enjoy evaluating gaming products. There has also been a little bit of a feeling from non-d20 and Indie gamers that the awards are too d20 centric. Since I like indie and non-d20 games, I think I can represent those gamers well.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;quote&gt;<br/>
2) What do you think of the importance of the Ennies?&lt;/quote&gt;<br/>
I think that the ENnies are the best awards for RPGs. Period. Ultimately they are the fan awards for RPGs, so a game that wins is the fan favorite. I think that publishers and gamers care more about what the fans like than some panel of pundits.<br/>
&lt;quote&gt;<br/>
3) What was the most fun you had gaming last year in a single session? Give details, and tell us briefly why.&lt;/quote&gt;<br/>
Playing Shades of Earth, Austrian Holiday.  The adventure was great and the groupd dynamics were great. Basically we had to go to a WWII era German research facility to reascue a scientist. Contact was lost with the facility the week before we arrived, but we did not know what was going on. To sum it up there was bio weapons research going on and something went haywire. Now the place was infested with mutant SS troopers, animal, and plants. There were a lot of good conflicts and there was always a decision to be made to do the "right thing", like when we captured an SS trooper and some wanted to torture him for info.<br/>
&lt;quote&gt;<br/>
4) About how often do you actually play games (not just read them)? What's your split of doing GMing to Playing?&lt;/quote&gt; about 1-2 times a week. We rotate GMs after each campaign. On average our campaigns last about 4 months. Sometimes longer or shorter depending on the game we are playing.<br/>
&lt;quote&gt;<br/>
5) If you were like one of those "Nobilis Gods" that only controlled one aspect of the universe, and that aspect was "RPGs"/"The RPG Market"/"RPGs in General" and the like, and you had the godlike power to influence the world of RPGs (from the way they are written, to how they are received and played, even to the market in general), what would you change about RPGs or 'the market' over the next 3-5 years?&lt;/quote&gt;<br/>
Well to be honest, I would most likely have made the aspects of producing and marketing RPGs cheaper and more cost effective. That way more people could afford to publisher their games and do it with higher quality and large print runs. That way WotC would not have a near monopoly on the RPG business. Not that I think D&amp;D is a bad game, it is infact a good game, I just think there are a lot of very enjoyable wmall press games that should get more recognition.<br/>
&lt;quote&gt;<br/>
6) What's the best 1-3 things that have happened in the world of Roleplaying/Gaming over the past three to five years?&lt;/quote&gt;<br/>
PDF Market: yeah it has been around for a while, but the last couple years it has started to make some noise. I has enabled many publishers to publish games they could not have otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
OGL/CC: letting people have free use of the basic systems? great idea.<br/>
<br/>
LuLu: and other pod printers: sort of in the same vain as PDF, but also allowed small publishers to print books as they go. Without POD becoming so much more popular over that last 3-5 years many games would not be in print.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;quote&gt;<br/>
7) What is your favorite gaming-related accessory (could be in general like "This Product X", or even specific, like "My Lucky Pencil")?&lt;/quote&gt;<br/>
probably my laptop. I use it to play music during the session, i create adventures and campaigns on it with all of the software (CC,fractal, name generators, Photoshop and such), I use it do display pcitures of scenes during games so players can get an Idea what thigs look like.                        </div>

1. I want to bring a different perspective to the judging, one metered by gameplay on 'both sides of the fence'.<br>2. The ENnies can be helpful to spotlight those titles that didn't make it into a gamer's range of vision, and can highlight where the industry is going and where it should go.<br>3. The finale to my gaming group's campaign for The Shadow of Yesterday. We'd already gotten to the end but it was also marked by a player's last chance to game before going to Africa. We played full force, burning keys and authoring awesome story. In the end, the traveling player's character ruled over our corpses. It was the first lengthy campaign for me for TSOY and it was fantabulous.<br>4. I try to play at least once a week but usually end up at an average of once every two weeks. I am constantly surprised when I'm not asked to GM.<br>5. I'd make it so that every gaming store could print out copies of books instead of buying them in advance and having to guess how many they need, thus helping the bottom line and providing access to nearly every game available.<br>6. Both the concept of Open Source gaming and the GameChef competitions. They have inspired folks to share their works with others and brought out a pioneering spirit the industry I felt was missing. Great games have come out of both of these.<br>7. Honestly? Story Games. I get the best gaming ideas and recommendations from people here. So, online fora to be more generic.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

<b>Why do you want to be a judge for the Ennies?</b><br>I have been working as a volunteer for the awards for two years, helping to professionalize our voting systems and practices. Last year, we implemented instant runoff voting for the awards; and this year, we have managed to implement single transferable vote for the judge elections. Last year, I also developed a standard news release format for the awards and a small media list for future press relations.<br><br>I find the group of people who run the ENnies to be a phenomenal group of individuals to work with and find there is a spirit of camaraderie, sacrifice, service and shared fun in being part of this volunteer enterprise that one would be hard-pressed to duplicate anywhere in the non-profit sector. I would really like the chance to continue to be part of that and continue helping to guide the awards as they mature.<br><br><b>What do you think of the importance of the Ennies?</b><br>In an industry in which so many designers are quasi-volunteers, it is obviously important to create and foster institutions that recognize people for their hard work and innovation because this is not a sector that is going to produce many millionaires. <br><br>I also think the ENnies are important because they are a kind of hybrid award that does not merely reward products for good marketing and popularity; the extensive judging and nominations process creates chances for high quality small publishers and obscure products to be introduced to a large body of gamers.<br><br><b>About how often do you actually play games (not just read them)? What's your split of doing GMing to Playing?</b><br>I play games once a week on Thursday nights where our group alternates between two campaigns. I GM every second Sunday night.<br><br><b>What was the most fun you had gaming last year in a single session? Give details, and tell us briefly why.</b><br>The most fun I hadâ€¦ let me be brutally honest: my Thursday night gaming group is an example, on paper, of everything you can do wrong in a gaming group. One GM is an incredibly heavy-handed railroader who is using a set of homebrew rules that are growing like OD&amp;D grew into AD&amp;D: through a set of completely unrelated ad hoc mechanics that are codified post-facto into the rules. The other GM has a giant metaplot and detailed history and politics but little idea of what his world looks like on the ground;  furthermore, we are constantly being followed around by over-powered NPCs who save our lives and steal our kills. Furthermore, the games are largely run and played by people who havenâ€™t really kept up with any significant innovations or developments in the hobby, other than 3E D&amp;D, since 1985 or so.<br><br>And yet, we have a blast: why? Good company, good people, witty senses of humour, a sense of when to digress from play and when to get back onto topic, great food and an ample supply of red wine or rum. In many respects, our games are socially more like a weekly poker game with the guys than an RPG group. The games work because one GM and I get into history geek arguments about the details of various historical epochs; and other players mock us; we incorporate Simpsons, Terry Pratchet and Trailer Park Boys references and occasionally grant bonus experience for deft incorporations; we listen to peopleâ€™s anecdotes and war stories about living in Guatemala, joining the army or doing fringe politics; most importantly, the game comes because we have developed a set of victory conditions and a social contract that work for our group â€“ if we have all laughed really hard and killed some bad guys, the evening is a success.<br><br>Without a doubt, the best episode was one in which we had an amiable dispute with a GM who was trying to railroad us into solving a puzzle he had carefully designed. We had to solve it to enter a city. But the only reason we were showing up in the city was to warn and help them prepare for an imminent barbarian attack! So, why should we have to solve this puzzle to get a meeting with the ruler when we had ridden at great risk through terrible danger to help him!? We failed to puzzle and spent a whole day cooling our heels in the town until the ruler decided he would deign to see us after all. So, when we appeared before the Scaled Sage, he expressed surprise at our knowledge and power, given that we had failed his test. <br><br>â€œActually,â€ my character said, â€œwe have a riddle for you your majesty.â€<br><br>â€œReally?â€<br><br>â€œKnock. Knock.â€<br><br>â€œWhoâ€™s there?â€ he replied.<br><br>â€œFuck off.â€ And our entire party extended their middle fingers in unison.<br><br>â€œAlso,â€ I said to the GM, â€œIâ€™m going to use my empathic link to get my familiar to shit on his rug.â€<br><br>Yes. Itâ€™s true, I have had some deeply satisfying experiences, like when my players realized that their characters were both the four knights who achieve the grail <i>and</i> the four Tezcatlipocas of Aztec mythology and bought me colour-coded presents for our final session to show how they had figured out the symbol system along with a wand, a sword and a cup. The final meeting of my players with the imprisoner Kronos in the City of Glass was deeply fulfilling as I watched them put my whole puzzle together and realize that Iousekha (from Huron myth) and Kronos were the same god but frankly, it didnâ€™t hold a candle to delivering the knock-knock joke.<br><br><b>If you were like one of those "Nobilis Gods" that only controlled one aspect of the universe, and that aspect was "RPGs"/"The RPG Market"/"RPGs in General" and the like, and you had the godlike power to influence the world of RPGs (from the way they are written, to how they are received and played, even to the market in general), what would you change about RPGs or 'the market' over the next 3-5 years?</b><br>I would cause a sophisticated neo-simulationist movement to come into being that took seriously the idea of the rules of games being the physics of the game worlds and worked through all the implications of this. <br><br><b>What's the best 1-3 things that have happened in the world of Roleplaying/Gaming over the past three to five years?</b><br>I think the most important development is that a lot of the insights that have been developed in the Indie community have begun to filter into mainstream gaming. For a while, it seemed like there was not a whole lot of intellectual exchange amongst the different movements and theories of gaming. Now, I feel like more and more designers looking not only at each otherâ€™s stuff but each otherâ€™s online communities and bodies of theory making good practical uses of their innovations.<br><br><b>What is your favorite gaming-related accessory (could be in general like "This Product X", or even specific, like "My Lucky Pencil")?</b><br>My pewter rum flask.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

Yeah, it's been that way for a few days.  I assumed she withdrew, I know at least one nominee did.                        </div>
