This is a lot more modest in scope, only two players (which is really nice -- I realize that I kind of suck at distributing spotlight time despite the potential for multi-threaded storylines, so it's awesome having only two players to work with, as long as they both stay active).  <br/><br/>The somewhat sketchy premise so far is that the riverlands have just fought off the combined armies of the Red Elves and Red Dwarves.  The leader of the human/halfling side got killed in the final battle, and his brother has enlisted the PC's to help him keep control of the situation.  Most of the game is set to take place in the main city, but I'm running a Dowleresque microdungeon under an old church to warm up and get us comfortable with the rules. The PC's are Hurtiancz, a human Bard played by my friend as the same glib sociopath he always plays (his description, not mine), and Aubrey, a grim Halfling fighter with a massive grudge against dwarves and pretty much everyone else.  <br/><br/>There was going to be an elven ranger as well -- that was my brainstorm, seeing that the ranger is pretty screwed when you get him out of the wilderness, to say that there's also a clan of urban elves who've lived in the capital city for century as refugees from their Red cousins and who've adapted to that lifestyle.  So these city elves have rangers, too, but they're masters of the urban jungle and get bonuses there, instead.  I like the idea so much I'm keeping it, even though the ranger's player dropped out, and will probably provide a tough ranger hireling when the game goes there.  I'm planning on still having discrete "dungeons" in the slums and sewers of the city, the way Warhammer does, so I can get my traps and giant beetles on, but still have plenty of human intrigue for the bard to work with. <br/><br/>Experiences so far: chargen was easy-peasy.  Bonds were quick and fun, although not as flavorful as AW relationships.  In general, the DW character classes so far feel more generic -- a AW Gunlugger is a very distinctive character by the time you finish chargen, while a DW fighter is not that different than a fighter in any other dungeon-type game.  Maybe it's just me and I'm not motivating people to world-build enough yet.  <br/><br/>I'm loving the AW-style ability to narrate and use moves and not have to worry about too many stats or maps or areas of effect. I think AW and DW are ruining my ability to run other games which put more demands on the GM.  I'm a little nervous about combat -- it feels like I need to work hard to keep the foes doing interesting things since there isn't much tactics and strategy in the actual combat system.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_341311">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel" title="Anarchangel"><img alt="Anarchangel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/333/nG33DU7UK4MTS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel">Anarchangel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341311/#Comment_341311" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-01T18:43:49+00:00" title="September  1, 2011  6:43PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DannyK</cite><br/>In general, the DW character classes so far feel more generic -- a AW Gunlugger is a very distinctive character by the time you finish chargen, while a DW fighter is not that different than a fighter in any other dungeon-type game.

It is a homage/simulation of old school D&amp;D-style dungeon bashes after all.<br/><br/>Your post has inspired me to revisit my last 4e campaign (an urban/rural mix) as a DW campaign, so thanks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342452/#Comment_342452" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-12T16:30:49+00:00" title="September 12, 2011  4:30PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My advice about combat is to put as much tactics or strategy as youc an muster in a few seconds into the enemies. The bad guys have a split second to respond, what do they come up with? There aren't really wrong answers since EVERYTHING demands a response from the PCS.<br/><br/>As far as ruining other games: yeah, I have a bit of that same thing. I have to work to get out of the A/DW mold.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
