Therefore there isn't really any group to whom I might introduce a game or changes to a game.<br/><br/>That said, I'm a new game guy, switching groups or not.

You guys are all saying what I'd say, in principle, if someone asked me, theoretically.  But it runs counter to my own campaign play experience, especially in high school and college (where campaign play is most convenient).  Back then, we picked a game based mostly on the setting and other color, tried to play it by the book initially, then quickly ditched parts we didn't like, and added procedures from past play that we did like.  At any point, someone might buy a GURPS setting book or a Warhammer FRP module and tack elements from those onto our D&amp;D2 game.  <br/><br/>We were constantly creating techniques that were core to our experience -- stuff like "Raise your hand so we know when you're speaking out of character."  If someone had offered to sell us that before we'd come up with it on our own, I have no idea how we would have reacted.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270626">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270626/#Comment_270626" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-10T13:37:08+00:00" title="May 10, 2010  1:37PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Back in high school I used to do "multi-track" recording with a boombox, a Walkman running through a guitar amp, and many, many cassette tapes.
