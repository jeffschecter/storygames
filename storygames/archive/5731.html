To resolve these things, play goes like this:<br/>\n<ol>\n<li>One of the two players declares two possible outcomes for the situation.<br/></li><li>The other one picks which outcome actually happens.</li>\n</ol>\nThat's all.  But I think this construction would be much more interesting in play than it is to describe.<br/><br/><br/>Now, if both players have equal authority and opposed goals, you might need a rule "You don't specify who gets what".  So if two PCs are fighting over an ancient holy relic, you could say "One of us gets the idol, but they also are horribly scarred in the process, <b>OR</b> the idol is destroyed in the battle and no one gets it."  But you can't say, like "I get the idol <b>or</b> you get horribly scarred" because that would leave a crappy choice for the second player.  Possibly the rule could even be amended to be "you declare as many outcomes as there are characters in the conflict, but the other player decides who each outcome applies to."   <br/><br/>The thing that interests me here is that it would encourage mixed results in conflicts.  Like a kid slicing a cake, you want to make the smaller half as big as possible, which pushes toward evenness in results.  So you get pyrrhic or bittersweet victories or losses where you gain something.  And those are good gaming material.<br/><br/><br/>The other situation where this would work is if the players aren't in any way confrontational.  I can imagine a game like <a href="http://www.20by20room.com/2006/01/the_court_of_th.html" rel="nofollow">The Court of the Empress</a> (or another game where one player's goal is to please the other player) that used a similar setup.  The most benign of GM setups would be similar: the GM proposes two outcomes, and the player picks which one they want.  <br/><br/>Actually, with a GM and a torturous game (a la My Life With Master or Paranoia) the GM offering two horrible fates for your PC and you having to pick which one happens could also be really cool.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128157">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128157/#Comment_128157" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-20T15:28:41+00:00" title="February 20, 2008  3:28PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As for those situations you've described where "it wouldn't work", I actually think that it COULD be made to work by adding mechanical reinforcement of some kind to the outcomes.<br/><br/>I'm thinking of something like the "Trouble" meter mentioned in that other thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_128173">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128173/#Comment_128173" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-20T16:07:02+00:00" title="February 20, 2008  4:07PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm really digging that "you declare as many outcomes as there are characters in the conflict, but the other player decides who each outcome applies to" idea.

Hot!<br/><br/>I need to think on this a bit (IE, not when I have to go to work soon), but you could even escalate it up to more-than-two players involved in the decision making process, especially if you figured out some way to 'trim' suggested outcomes, possibly in a manner similar to Polaris's "You ask far too much" phrase. It gets really complicated if you try to involve more than three players (ludicrously so for more than four) but I think that's a complexity worth exploring at least as a little-idea-experiment. I'll give it some thought at work tonight and post some thoughts in the morning, because I think this idea is really cool. (Fair Division is one of those concepts that has always really interested me, although I'm by no means an expert)<br/><br/>Another interesting tactic might be something along the lines of "One person decides who gets hurt, short of death, and how much, by the fight, the other person decides who ends up with the idol" style 'divisions'.<br/><br/>Unfolding that to involve three people: Come up with three distributions-of-narration-rights. Another player chooses the right they think is best, and weaken it such that they consider it a tie with the second-best right. A third player picks which of the narration-rights they want. The second player picks one, but has to pick the one they weakened if the third player didn't. The first player gets whatever's left over.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128245">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128245/#Comment_128245" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-20T20:10:20+00:00" title="February 20, 2008  8:10PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 20, 2008 8:11PM by chearns.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>"I punch you in the face.

Like, this should definitely be illegal:<br/><br/>"I'm trying to get out of the prison cell."<br/>"I'm trying to keep you there, so either a bird flys by and poops on someone's head, or someone gets bit by a mosquito."<br/><br/>Like maybe there should be a rule that at least one of the options must lead to success for each party. Which can easily mean that they would be split one to one, or that one of the options could be interpreted to give success to either party.<br/><br/>Example (with the prison cell),<br/><br/>choose: whoever gets what they want has to kill a guard to do it, or the guards come and knock us both senseless.<br/><br/>Now, I realize that the rule I added wasn't sufficient, the concept is still broken, but I definitely think there's something there.<br/><br/>Interestingly to me, this whole idea, beyond reminding me a of a MtG card, is also reminding me of A Penny For My Thoughts.

Maybe your freedom is worth that to you, maybe not, maybe your lover's freedom is worth more than your own.  I don't know.<br/><br/>C) The game might very well need strict limits on when a PC can be killed.  So you can only kill PCs in the endgame or something.  This isn't really a problem, since it's desirable to not kill the other characters early on in most games and leave a player with nothing to do, anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_128629">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128629/#Comment_128629" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T11:49:00+00:00" title="February 21, 2008 11:49AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think keeping this task-y is a bad move.  <br/><br/>"you're going to kill my dad or marry my sister."<br/><br/>One thing I really like about the pie-cutting is that it doesn't matter who cuts and who chooses.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128865/#Comment_128865" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T18:51:57+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  6:51PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If this can be made to work, I think it would be nearly ideal for Amber.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_128890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128890/#Comment_128890" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T20:04:23+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  8:04PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite><br/>"I'm trying to get out of the prison cell"<br/>"I'm trying to keep you in there, so either no one manages to open the door, or the guards come and stop the fight - you choose."</blockquote>\nSee, under my proposed variant where you are distributing the right to choose outcomes in certain areas rather than the outcomes themselves, you would need to divide it into "One of us chooses whether or not the escape attempt is successful, and one of us chooses X", and if you want to get out of jail, you obviously need to make X something they consider important enough to choose that instead, and if you want to keep them in jail, likewise. So, for example, X might be "how the public reacts to the escape attempt", so the person choosing will effectively be selecting between "The prisoners escape, but are reviled by the populace and a city-wide manhunt is underway", or "the prisoners fail to escape, but news of their plight reaches the city-folk and massive protests are staged."<br/><br/>Which is fun in that, if you're willing to risk your character's life for some goal, you CAN just go "One of use chooses whether or not X is successful, and one of us chooses who lives and dies." In which case, if the other person definitely wants to keep their character around, they'll choose the latter option, which means you can succeed at the task, although it may be at the cost of your character's life. Of course, if <i>they're</i> willing to give up their character's life to stop X, you're in trouble.

It did well in the contest part of GC, but when I actually playtested it, it fell apart.  Probably because I was putting too many restrictions on what people could narrate as part of resolution.  (YMMV, it reportedly worked for a group of Italian players.  I eventually revised the game to <a href="http://nickwedig.libraryofhighmoon.com/2012/06/house-of-masks-new-playtest-version/" rel="nofollow">something I'm happier with</a>.)<br/><br/><br/>The basic "cut the pie" idea might be salvaged, though, by tweaking the parameters of decision making.  Increasing the overall "Otherkind-ness" of the mechanic might help.  <br/><br/>Maybe something like this:  When you attempt to perform a task, we define 4 possible outcomes.  Then the acting player and the antagonist player take turns taking control of potential outcomes until the active player has (character skill level, between 1 and 3) outcomes under their control.  If an outcomes is under your control, then you get to decide how it turns out.<br/><br/>I'd want to dress that basic idea up with some other mechanics. (Dice would make it basically Otherkind.  An auction or resource management minigame would be interesting as well.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394311">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/doho123" title="doho123"><img alt="doho123" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/doho123">doho123</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394311/#Comment_394311" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-22T11:28:18+00:00" title="October 22, 2012 11:28AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I used this method pretty much in my epistolary "play by email" game I came up with.
