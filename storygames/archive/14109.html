I like the mechanics driving the Smallville RPG, and I understand that Leverage uses roughly the same system, so I'm wondering if there will be a standalone, unlicensed corebook covering the Cortex Plus system released at any point. 'Cause I'm rather neutral about the Leverage cover, and I strongly dislike the Smallville cover (it completely fails to represent what I liked about Smallville to begin with, namely Clark's relationship with Lex, Lana and Jonathan), and I'm quite liking the generic Cortex cover, so something I'd like to display on my bookshelf but with a system I really enjoy would be quite nice.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_319443">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/theg33k" title="theg33k"><img alt="theg33k" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img96.imageshack.us/img96/7043/fil31771.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/theg33k">theg33k</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319443/#Comment_319443" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-07T14:56:57+00:00" title="April  7, 2011  2:56PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            They published the core book going on a couple of years ago now, I think:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.margaretweis.com/mwp-online-store/cortex" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.margaretweis.com/mwp-online-store/cortex</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_319453">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319453/#Comment_319453" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-07T15:37:00+00:00" title="April  7, 2011  3:37PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That corebook is not related to the Cortex Plus system that's being asked about.<br/><br/>Actually I sort of question whether the same system is really being used in Leverage and Smallville.

I've mostly been buying PDFs and wishing they were .docs or something so I could more easily strip out the full page images and print them in fewer pages when I print out a reference copy.<br/><br/>So I can't really sympathize with the OPs main concern.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_319488">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks" title="CamBanks"><img alt="CamBanks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks">CamBanks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319488/#Comment_319488" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-07T21:47:31+00:00" title="April  7, 2011  9:47PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There won't be a generic rulebook for Cortex Plus. We thought about this for a long time, and the upshot is that Cortex Plus is more of a "language of design" that informs the RPGs we create, as opposed to being something that could stand alone as a generic book (as we did with Classic Cortex). Instead, Cortex Plus appears as the methodology and underpinning of our licensed games and in each case it's tweaked and designed to meet the demands of the genre or license in question.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have had a significant volume of feedback from gamers who are taking Smallville and Leverage beyond their initial licenses and hacking them for their own campaigns. To facilitate this and foster this notion of hacking our games, we're putting together an anthology product called the Cortex Plus Hacker's Guide. This book will go on sale electronically, a digest sized 4.99 PDF/ePUB/POD product with 25 articles by a number of game designers and writers, including Rob Donoghue and Josh Roby, who shared design lead duties with me on Leverage and Smallville respectively. The Guide includes adaptations for new genres, discussions on expanded rules and game theory, and modular add-ons that should serve as examples of what can be done with the Cortex Plus rules. I expect the Cortex Plus Hacker's Guide to go on sale in May.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nCam                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_319506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319506/#Comment_319506" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-07T23:11:01+00:00" title="April  7, 2011 11:11PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That could be even cooler than a generic rulebook.
