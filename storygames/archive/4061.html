Is it a story game?(*)<br/><br/>d20 gamers will probably cringe at the meta mechanics, and story gamers will be turned off by the d20 weight (and "cultural baggage")<br/><br/>(*) My reply to those: Yes, it is still a d20 game if it retains the d20 tropes (classes, levels, hps, feats), and yes, it is a story game. And if you pimp enough the story games elements in it, people on this board will probably check it out. OTOH, you might lose the d20 market altogether... so why bother making it a d20 derived game in the first place?</acronym></acronym></blockquote>\nI, for one, would be <i>all over</i> a game like that. It wouldn't necessarily <i>have</i> to be d20, but something with a hefty set of "roll dice and kill stuff" rules combined with systems that try to ensure that all that rolling and killing happens in meaningful conflicts that drive a story.<br/><br/>That's exactly what I'm looking for in a game (with the additional caveat that it also needs to be playable by just two people); thus far I haven't found it.

I wouldn't say D&amp;D / d20 is necessarily not suitable for 2-player (or 1-player, 1-GM) play. It's certainly not any less suitable than most other 'traditional' RPGs. It's a lot more suitable, in my book, than, say, Shock:, WGP:, InSpectres, or many of the more narrative (ie, thought of as applicable to this forum) games. And in my experience, it's more suitable than Primetime adventures. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll you need, without quoting the Forge too much, is to have a consistent creative agenda. And with one player and one GM that's pretty straightforward to acquire. If you're GMing, just ask the player what story he wants to tell over the next few sessions. Then tell him that's exactly what he's going to do. If he worries about how many XP he's going to get, or what magic items he gets at the end, you might need to explore whether you really both want a narrative game or not. But in my (limited) experience, one-on-one games naturally flow towards a narrative focus anyway. After all., what are you doing if you're not telling a story to each other that you couldn't do with a games console?<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, there's a post here from Ron Edwards about running (approx) 3rd ed D&amp;D with a narrativist twist, without changing any rules:<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=20257.0                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
