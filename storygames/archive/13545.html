I have a played a very good variety of soccer-themed boardgames and recently paricipated in a PTA series based around a soccer club. The game was great and it sparked me the interest in finding or designing a soccer specific RPG. <br/><br/>I have been playing RPGs since 1993 and Indie games since 2007. I have played: PTA, Ribbon Drive, Breaking the Ice and Dirty Secrets. Have thoroughly read Universalis, Trollbabe, Best Friends, TSOY, The Pool, Lady Blackbird, Grey Ranks, SotC and partially Capes.<br/><br/>I seriously doubt there is much interest in a soccer-themed RPG and therefore I think I would have to come up with it myself.<br/><br/><br/>I would like it to be a GM-ful game just because these are much more enjoyable to me. I would like a game to be based on the characters stories and motivations but I would like them to directly impact on the players' and team's performance. I was thinking that at the end of each session, there would be the MATCH where everything that happened would somewhat have an expression on the pitch and be relevant to the final score. I would really like to see a mechanic linking players actions, choices, successes and failures directly impact on the Match.<br/><br/> In case of victory, the player (not necessarily soccer player character) that contributed the most would be the MAN OF THE MATCH and would have benefits tat would translate into the game, probably next session. In case of defeat, the player that contributed the least would take one for the team.<br/><br/>I would like to have a game that could play as a one shot - A Match so to speak, or that could be played over several sessions - A Season. Or even many seasons - A History (or Dinasty). I would like the game not to be very crunchy since I would like it to be easy to pick up and play. Difficulty level like PTA, Ribbon Drive, Best Friends would be great.<br/><br/>Any suggestions on how I could attempt to achieve these goals?<br/><br/>Thank you.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306069/#Comment_306069" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-27T14:49:40+00:00" title="December 27, 2010  2:49PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            These are not impossible goals, and your desire for a soccer-based (or should I say proper football/futbol-based) game is shared by some of us. At least I think it'd be cool.<br/><br/>The first question that comes to my mind is this: would the players be representing individuals? Or would each person take control of a team, and play against each other? If they are individuals, then how do you represent the actions of those team members who end up being NPCs?<br/>Also, how would you want events and motivations outside of a match influence the events inside a match?<br/><br/>My initial thoughts for this fall upon one of my favorite games, Danger Patrol. It would be simple enough to divide the abilities into on-field and off-field related aspects, and Danger Patrol does allow for a fairly smooth transition between action and interlude. The action scenes could be matches, the interludes being interviews and PR opportunities, and the suspense scenes could represent their normal lives and outside events which may later influence the next game.<br/><br/>This would work particularly if you run each session much like a sport-oriented Japanese anime. I know there's been a few soccer-related series, though none have really made their way to the US, but the way series such as Prince of Tennis or Slam Dunk are structured would work just as well for a soccer-related series, whether centered on high school, Nationals, or even the World Cup.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306072">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306072/#Comment_306072" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-27T15:25:32+00:00" title="December 27, 2010  3:25PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Agon.

Players, manager, owner, agents, doctor, nurse, physical therapist or even significant others, offspring, sibblings, etc. Even the characters that are not football players or managers, would have their actions affect the outcome of The Match.<br/><br/>The Match would be played at the end of the session and would last about 5-10 minutes. It could work as a summary or reflection of the session and probably give a starting point to the next session. <br/><br/>In a way, The Match would be building up the whole session. For example, an impulsive act during the session could make The Club play more offensively or more aggressive or with an attacking formation (4-2-4) during the match. Failed actions during the session could lead to injuries during practices or unfavorable sports court decisions leading to suspensions. Cautious choices could lead to conservative play during The Match, etc...<br/><br/>The game would still be about the characters: jealousy, intrigue, overcoming adversity, growth, etc... The Club would be the background, synthesis, thermometer and end-result of all the choices, decisions, actions, successes and failures.<br/><br/>Thanks                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306081">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306081/#Comment_306081" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-27T16:13:20+00:00" title="December 27, 2010  4:13PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Robbins</cite>Agon.

During the match, the team can use that Trait if they want to. So, if you win an argument by being really pushy and fierce, you add "Fierce" to a piece of paper in the centre of the table called "The Team."<br/><br/>And perhaps whenever the Producer wins a conflict, they add a Trait to "The Opposing Team."

I am going to playtest it with otherwise plain PTA. I wonder if it could be expanded not just to results of conflict but traits also being attached to characters personal choices and actions. An antagonistic character (PC) could also have a choice to add the trait to the opposition rather than The Club.<br/><br/>I would like to play with the soccer jargon, using aspects such as Formation/Strategy as mentioned above. I would like to give a true football feeling to The Match. Probably, make a couple of plays (dice, cards, coins, dominos, whatever) to decide the outcome, adding a bit of tension.<br/><br/>Sorry to have gotten Ribbon Drive's name confused. My excuse is that I worked hard from 12/23 through 12/26 and I am still recovering.

I would be the first in line the day they came out. I am more or less set in a game that would allow for a greater range of roles. Since the theme is not that attractive for many people, at least giving some leeway on what they can be, could make the barrier lower.<br><br>I do think that the matches of a metaphor for their lives and the events from the matches influencing their lives would be very desirable in the game I am hoping for.<br><br>The bet thing could be interesting even though it does not seem to be as strong in our culture in Brazil as it is in Europe or the US.<br/><br/>J. Walton:<br/>I would love to play Hutton's game. How do I contact him?<br/><br/>Mr. Toad: <br/>I have just peripherally read about Fiasco but your PlaySet made me very interested in getting the game. Your PlaySet seemed almost finished. Is it playable in its current form? How many players are needed for Fiasco? Is the PlaySet some sort of supplement, do I buy it from you to use it in my games? And, thank you for letting me check it out.<br/><br/>DevP:<br/>Because of this thread, I read Contenders. It is a beautiful RPG! The hacking is hard because the fight/match is a minigame inside the game that needs its own balance and has to tie with the rest of the system. It takes a bunch of playtesting, I imagine. It would constraint the choices a bit since everybody would have to be footballers. I think the Dream Team referrence is pertinent and I think in that sort of setting, you could attract many/or few potential players.<br/><br/>K Fyans:<br/>Yeah, kinda like that. I had never heard of RotR, I wish I had. I want to play that Fiasco PlaySet.<br/><br/>GB Steve:<br/>From the sound of that, I am afraid to even click the link. (Edit: Ok, I read it)<br/><br/>Sam!:<br/>I agree with your concern and I even say in my OP that it is probably a theme without a broad appeal. I did get my wife to play a couple of seasons of soccer-themed PTA where she ran the club and I was a young EPL player from Ukraine. I really enjoyed it. And, she seemed to have had her fair dhare of fun as well. Looking back, it is funny how my character followed the guidelines from Contenders since he started playing to raise money for his brother's treatment.<br/><br/><br/>I really appreciate you guys taking the time to pitch in. It is helpful and fun. I am hoping to come out of this with a "football/RPG" game to play. Be it a new game, a game that somebody is already working and hopefully finishing. That Fiasco PlaySet looks fun too.                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306361">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306361/#Comment_306361" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-30T08:42:53+00:00" title="December 30, 2010  8:42AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ronaldo, you can get Gregor Hutton's <a href="http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/up-go-the-heads" rel="nofollow">Up Go the Heads</a> at 1KM1KT.
