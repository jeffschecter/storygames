However, her caravan of traveling merchants was being stalked by a bobcat.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Myrtle was tending to the 8th floor insectry when a battering ram (or, beak) exploded through the wall, narrowly missing her. A woodpecker had decided to hammer on the hollow tree of Sprucetuck, sending deafening reverberations throughout the whole community, driving everyone outside into the snowy early spring weather... making them a perfect target for the approaching bobcat.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Winifred solo'd the bobcat for a full round until Brand (the patrol leader) could drive it off with a stinging hail of arrows.  Colin and Myrtle successfully drove the woodpecker off (towards the bobcat, which was their stakes), but not before noticing that it had a chain wrapped tightly around it's neck bearing a plaque that read "Hammerseth."  It also had a delivery pouch tied to its foot.<br/><br/>Later on, they found the bloody remnants of the woodpecker after it was torn apart by the bobcat.  Inside the delivery pouch -- still attached to the bird's foot -- was a letter that read "Meet me at the Ferndale Watchtower. -- Caroline."<br/><br/>Since they suspected it might be a weasel trick, the patrol tried to limit who knew about the letter, but we closed the session with the patrol noticing that they didn't know where Anthony, Caroline's brother, was... and guardmouse Myrtle was missing as well.<br/><br/>So this week: JOURNEY TO THE RUINS OF FERNDALE!<br/><br/>Can't fucking wait.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194576/#Comment_194576" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-26T14:32:52+00:00" title="February 26, 2009  2:32PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, we've drifted the game slightly (suck it, Luke!).<br/><br/>1.

They have tall, pointed ears tipped with tufts of black fur and appear to have very wide faces due to the large amount of fur on either side of their jaws. Bobcats have short, spotted tails -- as if "bobbed," hence their name -- and powerful hind legs longer than their forelegs, giving the wild cats a strange hobbling walk.<br/><br/>Though they prefer to hunt slightly larger animals such as rabbits, bobcats will certainly not pass up the opportunity to feast on unsuspecting mice.

Before play started my puppy Dante was obsessed with trying to jump up and lick John(who plays Brand)'s face for some strange reason.<br/><br/>John does this hilarious stern old military commander voice for Brand, who's a veteran of the Winter War.  Brand led the retreat from Ferndale to Sprucetuck, so I'm pretty excited to see what John does as a player when we head back there.  He can pretend to know all about it.  John also plays bass and we're in a bad together with his fiance Mel (keyboards), who just finished running 7th Sea for some other folks.<br/><br/>Jen(Winifred)'s my former housemate, who used to play a bunch of Earthdawn.

After Winifred solo'd the bobcat armed with only the mailbag, Brand gave Winifred his sword after chewing her out for endangering the mail.  Brand's sword is also a veteran of the Winter War and is a massive, weathered hunk of metal that's a bit too larger for a young mouse like Winifred to wield easily.<br/><br/>SESSION 3: FERNDALE<br/><br/>Robert (Myrtle) wasn't able to make it this week, which is why we set up Myrtle vanishing along with Anthony the week before.  In any case, this is how it went down.<br/><br/>As Brand, Colin, Winifred, and Clarence (NPC sub-tenderpaw kid) trudged towards Ferndale, Brand recounted what he remembered from his time there in the Winter War.  I handed John some notes on this before the game and he did a rambling, reminiscing monologue about it.  Ferndale, originally the furthest outpost on the western frontier, was built to be impregnable. The settlement started as a fortress built atop a rocky outcropping that protruded up from the middle of a bog.  The bog itself was created by a creek flowing through the lowlands between two hills, and the mice of Ferndale sailed to and from the settlement on boats. In the late spring, summer, and early fall, the bog was covered by an immense growth of ferns that hid the outcropping and the settlement entirely from view, aside from the lone watchtower of the fortress, which rose just above the tallest ferns.<br/><br/>However, the winter of the Winter War was the coldest in recent memory. The ferns were all black and dead and, even worse, the bog itself froze over entirely. The weasel army surrounded the settlement and advanced over the ice on foot, knowing the mice couldn't sail away.  Arriving from Sprucetuck (his hometown) to help with the evacuation, Brand and his patrol snuck in behind the advancing weasels and felled a sapling on the edge of the bog, creating a bridge of sorts from the top of the outcropping to the shoreline, right on top of the weasel's line (John made this up on the spot, which I thought was great). Because of this, many mice were able to escape the ensuing destruction of Ferndale.<br/><br/>The contemporary patrol arrived at the banks of the bog, however, to find that it had somehow been drained in the past three years, leaving a muddy bottom difficult to cross. However, the creek that had previously formed the bog was flowing more swiftly through the lowlands.  Many shells of the boats that had once served Ferndale now stood stranded in the muck, high and dry (or, wet and rotting), without the bog.  Colin, a former sailer from Port Sumac, immediately got to work making one of these wrecks serviceable while Winifred found an enormous magnolia leaf to disguise the ship. They finished by nightfall, launched their boat ("the Endurance"), and began to slowly drift towards the rocky outcropping where the ruins of Ferndale lay.<br/><br/>However, as they got closer, the creek began flowing disconcertingly faster. As they passed alongside the outcropping, Clarence (on the prow) yelled "Waterfall!" and leaped towards the cliff face... failing his leaping roll and falling into the cavernous hole that the creek now emptied into (yup, that would be the Darkheather, right underneath Ferndale no less). Winifred failed as well, taking "Injured" to succeed and busting her paw on some sharp rocks. Brand and Colin double-tapped Nature and scrambled up as the Endurance careened into the abyss after Clarence.<br/><br/>The remnants of the dwindling patrol continued through the burnt husk of Ferndale settlement, towards the fortress. However, Winifred failed her hide roll, thanks to her injury. We decided that Brand's sword was nearly impossible to carry one-handed, so she kept banging it into the scorched timbers of buildings, making a bunch of noise. Shouts were heard and torches were lit up in the fortress and a group of weasels descended down into the old settlement to search for the source of the noise.  Colin hid like the cowardly mouse he is, while Brand and Winifred were pursued and eventually captured by one of the weasels after a lop-sided fight.  Brand's bow was less useful in close quarters and Winifred had trouble swinging the sword with one good paw. The weasel bandit beat them with its club until they stopped moving and then carried them back to the fortress in its mouth, limping from the arrow Brand managed to stick in its calf.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194898">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194898/#Comment_194898" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-28T19:34:03+00:00" title="February 28, 2009  7:34PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 2, 2009 2:07PM by J_Walton.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Inside the fortress, there were two other weasels, an older, regal one who called himself "the Earl" and a scrawny one that began sharpening his knife and preparing to cook Winifred and Brand.  Brand, however, made his loremouse roll to be able to speak weasel and then won an argument with the Earl, convincing the weasel lord that there were more mice down in the Darkheather tunnels beneath them (which wasn't completely a lie, because Clarence was there, and maybe Myrtle and Anthony too). The Earl asked if those mice were "in the hands of those pirates?"  Brand said, "Uh.... yes, definitely!"<br/><br/>When the other weasels returned from searching the settlement, however, they didn't believe Brand's promise of more mice below and wanted to eat these two mice now.  An argument resulted, which turned into a brawl, and then one weasel knifed another and it was fucking on.  While the weasels were fighting amongst themselves, Colin snuck down into the fortress and freed Winifred and Brand. They scurried off towards the watchtower with the weasels fast on their tails.<br/><br/>They reached the top room of the watchtower only to find a spectacle of astonishing gore.  Two mice had been ripped apart there, mangled beyond all recognition, but it appeared to have been done almost a year ago, since everything was dried and rotten away.  Brand made a loremouse roll to try to determine what type of creature could have done this.  His mind said "wolverine," but a creature like that wouldn't have fit in the tower. Colin also examined the scraps of cloaks that remained and determined that the victims were guardmice.<br/><br/>With the weasels bursting into the room behind them, they didn't have any more time to piece together the crime scene, so they jumped out the window and tried to scrambled down the side of the tower towards the creek. Winifred failed her roll again (the dice were not kind to Jen) and plummeted into the creek before being quickly carried into the Darkheather, as Clarence had been earlier.  After examining this entrance and deciding to avoid falling into the Darkheather, Brand led Colin through the muddy bottom of the former bog, across to where the Winter War attack had originated from.  There, they found a burrow-style entrace into the Darkheather that they could simply walk into.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Winifred splashed around frantically in the darkness and eventually found herself clinging to the side of a large ship-size boat that was laying upended in the flooded Darkheather tunnel, with the back end of the ship sticking upright at a strange angle out of the water.  Winifred heard voices coming from inside the wrecked ship, and peaking through a hatch she spied Clarence (looking utterly terrified) sitting across a banquet table from a weasel dressed in a fancy but ill-fitting admiral's uniform that clearly once belonged to a mouse.<br/><br/>We ended there and are going to take the player's turn before starting next time.  Can't wait!

First, we ran the Player Turn from last session, with everybody pausing to lick their wounds.  Then it went down...<br/><br/>SESSION 4: JOURNEY THROUGH THE DARK(HEATHER)<br/><br/>Myrtle and Anthony began the first scene in an underground cell filled with tufts of dried feathers, obviously the cell where the late woodpecker had once been kept and trained.  Robert and I improvised some vague but worried conversations between Myrtle and Anthony, since I didn't want to reveal exactly who had captured them yet.<br/><br/>Next to where the creek plummeted into the Darkheather, Winnifred snuck into the wrecked ship and secretly freed Clarence from perhaps being eaten by the pack of "pirate" weasels.  Together, they stole away, climbing out of the wreck and heading down the dry part of the tunnel, in the opposite direction from where the creek was flowing.<br/><br/>Elsewhere, Brand and Colin began delving into the immense tunnel system, guided by Colin's compass (he a sailor!) and good sense of direction.  After moving through a series of abandoned rooms filled with empty stores and more than a few dead weasels and mice, they heard a bizarre thump-thump-clank noise coming up from the depths.  Colin went to ground again, while Brand was once again stuck out in the open, falling onto his back while trying to scramble and dig a side alcove hurriedly.  But what should emerge out of the darkness but two mice riding feral weasels. The weasels were chained up and clearly mistreated, much like the woodpecker had been and wore metal, bladed gauntlets on their paws, leading to the clanking noise whenever they hit small stones on the tunnel floor.<br/><br/>Next I revealed that Myrtle and Anthony were currently in the clutches of a group of mice who ride abused, feral weasels.  They had actually been captured by the "pirate" weasels but had been ransomed to the mice in exchange for more food (badly needed, since the weasels were starving).  In this scene, Myrtle was interrogated by the leader of the mice, Rose Marie, and her silent-but-scary lieutenant, Graf.  Rose Marie wore a "CL" Carolingian League pin, exactly like the ones wore by the doddering old scientist-revolutionaries in Sprucetuck (way back in Session 1), but she was surprised to learn from Myrtle that there was a Sprucetuck league, since she claimed that her group was the original Carolingian League, founded by Caroline from the survivors of Woodruff's Grove and Ferndale.  Unfortunately, Caroline disobeyed the League's own rules and was caught "communicating with outsiders" (mice from the Territories) and was thus "exiled" (though Myrtle rolled a success and figured out that Rose Marie was lying about exiling Caroline).  Myrtle ultimately convinces Rose Marie that she and Anthony came looking for Caroline because they were fed up with the Spucetuck league not actually doing anything and would be happy to join the Ferndale league.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Winnifred and Colin manage to pry open a set of massive, weasel-sized metal doors with Brand's sword (both of them pushing together) and sneak into the section of tunnels controlled by the savage Ferndale league.<br/><br/>Genevieve, the mouse leading the league patrol that stumbled upon Brand, sends the other mounted mouse, Taylor, back to tell Rose Marie that she's captured a guardmouse in the tunnels. After Taylor leaves, Genevieve and Brand have an argument that soon turns into a battle for control of her weasel mount.  Brand is ultimately victorious at getting the weasel to throw her off and Genevieve is knocked cold.  Brand makes a further roll to gain the weasel's allegiance and the trained beast leads Brand, Colin, and the unconscious Genevieve back towards the league's headquarters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_195874">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195874/#Comment_195874" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-06T10:15:23+00:00" title="March  6, 2009 10:15AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 6, 2009 10:21AM by J_Walton.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Myrtle and Anthony eat dinner with the 10-or-so members of the Ferndale league in their great hall.  Rose Marie explains proudly that the league began as a motley group of survivors living in the woods around Ferndale, but then, as the conquering weasels abandoned the city and fought amongst themselves, the league began conducting raids into the Dakheather and gradually took over a section of it, driving the weasels mostly to the surface (the ones left living in the fortress).  Myrtle presses them on what happened to Caroline and Rose Marie sticks to the "exiled" story, but Graf fails his deception roll and can't suppress an evil leering smile, so Myrtle becomes convinced that Rose Marie and Graf had Caroline killed.<br/><br/>In the midst of dinner, Myrtle spots Winnifred and Clarence sneaking into the room and signals them to stay quiet and hidden.  Once everyone settles down for the night, Myrtle sneaks off to chat with Winnifred and Clarence in an alcove, but as they are figuring out what to do, Brand and Colin enter, leading a feral weasel by the reins.<br/><br/>Brand nails a Circles role and recognizes Rose Marie as a former Captain in the Ferndale guard.  Also, apparently Brand and Graf were once part of the same patrol, before Graf went off to fight in the Winter War as soon as he heard of the weasel invasion (Graf hates weasels with a deep loathing).<br/><br/>Rose Marie and her league, weapons drawn, demand to know what happened to Taylor, Genevieve's patrol buddy.  Brand shrugs and says maybe he got lost in the tunnels on his way back.  In the midst of the standoff, Rose Marie orders Graf and two other mice to go look for Taylor.  Rose Marie demands "her weasel" back but Brand drops the reins, showing that the weasel has decided it prefers Brand.  However, then Graf returns with the other three feral weasels in tow (showing that he wasn't really going to look for Taylor), making Brand's weasel advantage look significantly less impressive.<br/><br/>Back over next to the metal doors, Winnifred and Clarence hear a scuffling commotion on the other side.  Peaking through the crack, Winnifred spots the "pirate" weasels listening on the other side.  Once again throwing their weight against the door, the two young mice manage to heave open the door on the weasels, leading the pirates to charge noisily into the league's headquarters. At the same time, Colin smacks Brand's weasel on the rump, sending it rushing straight for Graf, who it clearly has beef with.  Graf drops the reins of the other three weasels to draw his sword and they begin to indiscriminately attack both mice and pirate weasels.<br/><br/>Chaos erupts.<br/><br/>While Colin tries to usher Winnifred and Clarence down a side tunnel, Myrtle and Brand go after Rose Marie. Both sides manage to drop their opponent's Disposition down to 1, but then Myrtle nailed a brilliant Defend roll that put the guardmice back up to full Disposition.  Having successfully captured Rose Marie, they also retreat down the same side tunnel, ending that session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_195891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195891/#Comment_195891" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-06T11:23:55+00:00" title="March  6, 2009 11:23AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a great read, Jonathan.

The second map showing <i>The Mouse Colonies</i>, with all the settlements of the mice and their safe-paths. And the last map depicts the biggest settlement in the "Colonies", the headquarter of the Mouse Guard in my version; <i>Lockport</i>, with small houses between big rocks and partly under a fallen tree, by the shore of a lake. All names are in Norwegian, of course.<br/><br/>I've made a new, hand-drawn character-sheet too, in Norwegian.<br/><br/>All of this I have done to play the game in Norwegian. And further; I'm translating chunks of the game to accommodate that too. I'm so much more comfortable with playing in my own language, so the translation is a must. It has a bright side though; I get to read the game very thoroughly, and really delve into the possibilities of it. Makes me think I should investigate the possibilities for a full translation into Norwegian, and publishing the game here.

Once inside, the group healed, Colin fell asleep immediately, and Brand eventually interrogated Rose Marie, learning a bit more about the origins of the League and the fate of Caroline, who was caught using the woodpecker, Hammerseth, to communicate with someone from the outside, breaking her own laws.  Rose Marie also wondered aloud if Sprucetuck would be burning soon, since, with their leader captured by the Guard, the League would have no choice but to attack the Territories.<br/><br/><b>SESSION 5: THERE AND BACK AGAIN</b><br/><br/>Colin used his compass to lead the patrol through the labyrinthine tunnels to the side of the marsh closest to Sprucetuck.  Along the way, they found a couple mouse bodies that had been recently ripped apart by feral weasels.<br/><br/>Once on the other side, I said that we're were going to be running two conflicts that were happening at the same time -- the journey back to Sprucetuck and Rose Marie's attempts to escape from captivity -- but we'd run them back-to-back, with different groups of mice participating in each one.  Colin and Winnifred decided to handle the journey conflict, leaving Rose Marie to Myrtle and Brand.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Eben and Jen got their rolls hosed by the sudden, late-spring snowstorm, which had the intention of forcing the group to hole up for several days in a hollow tree trunk.  This gave Rose Marie several opportunities to escape, including one Feint in which she grabbed Brand's rusty weasel dagger (which he'd grabbed in the tunnels to use as a broadsword) and tried to get the patrol to kill her instead of taking her back.  There was also an attempt to goad Anthony into some kinda of enraged act, by telling him that Caroline's Law said the penalty for trafficking with outsiders was to have your right paw cut off (implying that she had done that to Caroline).  However, Myrtle and Brand ultimately triumphed, winning some grudging respect from Rose Marie in the process, such that she would think twice before crossing them again.<br/><br/>After waiting out the snow, the group emerged and continued on the road to Sprucetuck, only to come across two sets of tracks in the fresh snow.  One set was showed two feral weasels traveling with some mice, while the other set showed another two feral weasels traveling on their own, pursuing the first group.  Upon arriving at Sprucetuck, they saw a patch of blood on the snow outside the tree and also noticed that the unaccompanied weasel tracks split off and circled around the tree while the mice-and-weasel tracks continued directly towards Sprucetuck.  They approached closer to examine the bloody patch on the snow -- a chipmunk that had been ripped apart -- when two weasels poked their heads over a nearby hill and began swiftly bearing down on them.<br/><br/>As the patrol began running towards the entrance to Sprucetuck, war-veterans Brand and Colin turned around and attempted to hold off the weasels while the tenderpaws Winnifred and Myrtle took Clarence, the injured Rose Marie, and Anthony inside.  Rose Marie tripped on the way, however, and the veterans were soon barely preventing the weasels from tearing her to shreds.  After two rounds of going toe-to-toe with two feral weasels, the weasels had a Disposition of 8 (down from 12) while Colin and Brand had 2 (down from 8) remaining.  Luckily for the patrol, Myrtle and Winnifred turned immediately around after getting Anthony and Clarence inside.<br/><br/>Not entirely sure how to reframe the conflict, I improvised, splitting the weasel pair into two individual weasels (rolling 5 dice each, instead of 8 combined) and dividing patrol into two sets of 2 mice (Myrtle coming to Colin's aid, while Winnifred backed up Brand).  Both sides kept their current Disposition, so each pair of mice started with Disposition 2, reflecting their dire situation, and each weasel started with Disposition 8.  The dice being rolled were more balanced now, but the mice couldn't really stand to take a hit of any kind.  By tapping Nature all over the place, the patrol persevered, with Myrtle &amp; Colin dropping to Disposition 1 before taking their weasel out and Winnifred &amp; Brand going back up to Disposition 8 thanks to an epic double-Nature, exploding-6s Defend by Winnifred.<br/><br/>However, just as the weasels were being gutted, all the commotion attracted the attention of the bobcat (from Session 2) who was still roaming the area, so the injured and exhausted group hot-footed it into Sprucetuck and barred the doors behind them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197575/#Comment_197575" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-18T10:20:58+00:00" title="March 18, 2009 10:20AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan, are you running this campaign with a more traditional approach to the GM pacing of events...as opposed to the very specific "X" obstacles method in the book.

Graf, who had lost an arm to a weasel and looked in very poor health, was sitting in front of a large planning table in the central square where the elevators used to run.  His chief lieutenant was now Genevieve, the League captain that Brand knocked cold by seizing control of her weasel.  Genevieve informed them that the League was in charge, the Guard was officially disbanded within Ferndale, Wessex had been placed in charge of military(League)-civilian relations, and all civilians were required to spend 2 hours a day helping to dig a tunnel out of Sprucetuck.  Apparently, the inhabitants were trapped inside by the weasels and the bobcat and had almost run out of supplies, since the Winter stores were basically gone and no one could leave to gather the first fruits of Spring.  The tunnel was their hope for replenishment as well as flanking the predators.<br/><br/>Oh, and the League still had two feral weasels under their control, who were being kept in the barracks and bar formerly overseen by the Sprucetuck militia.  And neither Graf or Genevieve seemed happy to see Rose Marie alive.<br/><br/>At this point, Colin became a tragic Shakespearean figure, yelling loudly, "Are there no mice in Sprucetuck who will not stand up to these mad brutes?!"  But only blank and frightened faces of scientists and barely-trained militia mice reflected back at him.  Ultimately, Brand dismissed his patrol, but whispered that they should meet in his apartment later that night.<br/><br/>This week... shit hits the fan in League-occupied Sprucetuck.

Frex, the last session saw Weather Conflict, Animal Conflict, and Mouse Conflict, so I never throw down two of the same obstacle in the same session.  However, yeah, the game has unintentionally turned into a chronicle that takes place entirely within a single season, Spring, even though we were intending to have a couple of sessions per season.  Instead, we're ending up with a six-issue (six-session) structure more like an arc in the comics, which works just fine, I think.  So I guess the answer is that it's somewhere in between "traditional GM pacing" and the strict guidelines in the Mouse Guard book.  Does that answer your question?  The third conflict last session was one I threw in because 1) they botched the Weather/Journey conflict and 2) we had a bunch of time left before 10:30, when we usually wrap up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197583">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197583/#Comment_197583" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-18T10:49:30+00:00" title="March 18, 2009 10:49AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah.

Maybe I'll see if we can do a Winter Session (maybe taking place amist the long, warm Summer, actually) after this arc wraps up.<br/><br/><b>Ralph:</b> Actually, I've been planning the game session by session, which is definitely something I'd recommend.  For the first session, I wrote the Ballad of Caroline and invented a few juicy NPCs for the players to confront: notably Oliver (Gewndolyn's Commander of Western Intelligence), the mischievous Clarence, Caroline's brother Anthony, the suspicious Wessex (former guard captain), and the Sprucetuck League of doddering old scientist would-be revolutionaries.  The two conflicts I planned for the first session were the journey to Sprucetuck and some kind of confrontation with Wessex.  The latter ended up not happening, but the players snuck into a League meeting, confronted Anthony about writing the song, and did a bunch of other interesting but not-full-conflict things.<br/><br/>Then, once that session was over, I sat down with my notes on what had happened and planned the next session.  Jen was joining the game, so I had her bringing the patrol's new orders from Oliver, but I wanted an animal fight, so I invented the bobcat.  That didn't seem interesting enough, so I added the woodpecker Hammerseth as well.  Originally, I was thinking Hammerseth was totally a weasel trick, that the weasel's had heard the song about Caroline (who was long dead) and were using their trained woodpecker to lure some mice to Ferndale where they could be captured.<br/><br/>That was actually my plan through Session 3, until I realized (as I posted <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=8815&amp;page=1#Item_4" rel="nofollow">over here</a>) that all the upcoming conflicts were with weasels, but all the characters traits were about mice and preserving the territories.  That's when I invented the Ferndale League, right before Session 4.  Before that, it was going to be about the conflict between the Earl and the Countess (which I described <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=8882&amp;page=1#Item_1" rel="nofollow">over here</a>).<br/><br/>So, while in retrospect, it may look like I've planned everything from the beginning (and the players may even think that's happening), that isn't true at all, actually.  Does that give you a better sense of how I'm doing it?  I definitely think you should stick to planning one session at a time and then sit down in between sessions and decide what the obstacles are for next time.<br/><br/>Right now, for example, I'm in Bruegger's Bagles, looking over what I just wrote up about the last session and trying to decide what the obstacles are going to be for tomorrow night.  I'm trying to decide if Graf is really an obstacle or if it would be more interesting is he died suddenly of his wounds, leaving a power vacuum where Genevieve, Brand, Wessex, and Rose Marie may all be scrambling for control of Sprucetuck (as you can imagine, I'm leaning towards the latter).  And there's still the bobcat outside, right?  And Winnifred is known for beating the bobcat the first time... which makes for a neat opportunity.  And Colin has this Belief that goes: "The Guard is built on the labor of oridinary mice," so I fully expect him to do some unionizing when he's laboring on the League's tunnel.  Plus, at some point Anthony has to re-write the end of the song about Caroline, right?  And that connects him to Myrtle, which gives me something interesting for each player to do, but those aren't really obstacles yet, just ideas.  But they're a start...                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197613/#Comment_197613" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-18T12:02:03+00:00" title="March 18, 2009 12:02PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sweet.

We've done it... twice, I guess?  So we started play in early March (fictionally) and it's now late April, early May.<br/><br/>I definitely think you could make play much more episodic and self-contained if you wanted, as long as each session ends in a situation where there can be a sizable amount of downtime.  Recently, sessions have ended with characters about to be eaten by weasels, which makes it harder to fast forward a month or two.  You could clearly structure it more like episodes of Buffy or Rome rather than episodes of a TV mini-series that follow directly on each other (I'm at a loss for examples of the latter, but there are some that are like a long movie that's been chopped up).                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_199053">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199053/#Comment_199053" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-27T06:51:57+00:00" title="March 27, 2009  6:51AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wrapped up the game with Session 7 last night.  It rocked socks.  But now I have to play catch-up over the past two sessions...<br/><br/><b>SESSION 6: THE MICE ACT WEASELY</b><br/><br/>During the player turn, an exhausted Brand confronts Rose Marie and tries to gain her help in resolving the Ferndale League's occupation of Sprucetuck, but Rose Marie schools Brand, 3 successes to 1.  She heads off on her own, disappearing into the city, and he watches her go.<br/><br/>Winnifred goes down to the larder to check out the stores, since she has a bunch of ranks in Harvester and Famine-Wise.  Things are not looking very good.  Rationing has already started and Sprucetuck will be experiencing a full-on famine in about a week.<br/><br/>Myrtle goes to chat with the music teacher she had encountered earlier, trying to lose her Angry condition over a cup of weak tea.  She fails and is still totally fed-up with the current situation.  Colin crashes on a couch and sleeps.<br/><br/>Clarence wakes Winnifred up to tell her about the plan that he and Anne (Wessex's daughter, the original singer of the Ballad of Caroline) have cooked up.  They have a backpack rigged to operate like one of the elevators in Sprucetuck, allowing mice to belay down from tree branches in a manner that seems horribly unsafe, offset by the weight of a large rock.  They want Winnifred, the known bobcat-fighter to get a drop on the bobcat using the pack while Clarence distracts it by riding forth on the back of a stolen feral weasel.  When Winnifred reports this to Brand at the meeting, the patrol begins planning how to stop this madness.<br/><br/>That night, Anthony sneaks into Graf's apartment, straddling the injured mouse's chest and demanding to know what really happened to Caroline.  He is followed by Colin and Myrtle and Colin finally has to stop him when Anthony starts strangling Graf, who offers only scraps of information like "...the tower!... wasn't my idea!"  Once some militia members burst in and haul Anthony away, Colin decides Anthony had the right idea -- even though he didn't want murder to be on Anthony's conscience -- and moves to stab Graf himself.  Myrtle intervenes and they wrestle for Colin's sword for a while before both stalking off after a heated conversation about what the Guard's true responsibilities include.<br/><br/>In any event, Graf dies during the night, from his previous injuries and perhaps helped along by Anthony's attack.  Anthony himself is kept prisoner in Graf's old apartment by Genevieve and the Ferndale League.  Wessex himself comes to Brand and ask for his help in saving the life of his manservant (Anthony).  With no food in Sprucetuck, the feral weasels are growing hungry and desparate, so rumor has it that the League is considering feeding Anthony to the weasels, as punishment for Graf's death.<br/><br/>And so an elaborate and somewhat ridiculous plan is concocted and executed by the patrol.<br/><br/>Winnifed and Myrtle wander around the tunnels near the roots of the tree, picking a known variety of poisonous mushroom. That night, militia collaborators bury Graf's body in a side alcove of the tunnel. Wessex maneuvers Brand and Colin onto the work detail that comes in on the next shift.  They bluff the guards into going to fetch some timbers to "shore up the tunnel so it doesn't collapse on all of us" and dig up Graf's body.  While Brand provides some cover, Colin sneaks the body over to where the feral weasels are kept in cages.  He then, quote, "chops the body up, stuffs it full of mushrooms, and feeds it immediately to the weasels."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Winnifred and Myrtle have borrowed the belaying pack from Clarence and Anne.  They haul the pack and its attached rock up to the insectry, which has not yet been fully repaired from the woodpecker attack.  They consider using the pack to drop Winnifred down the side of the tree, landing her on the small balcony outside Graf's former apartment, but instead untie the rope from both pack and rock, having Winnifred simply climb down it.  They rescue Anthony and stow him with the music teacher, before joining the rest of the patrol for a well-deserved hot bath.<br/><br/>So... there were no full-on conflicts last week, just normal obstacles, which felt a bit weird to me but all the players said they still enjoyed it.  I found myself wishing that there was a "Caper" conflict type for escapades of this sort, but maybe Luke doesn't want to encourage mice to act like weasels.<br/><br/>That just leaves the final session from yesterday.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_199061">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199061/#Comment_199061" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-27T07:40:10+00:00" title="March 27, 2009  7:40AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 27, 2009 7:43AM by J_Walton.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hoo boy...<br/><br/><b>SESSION 7: UNFINISHED BUSINESS</b><br/><br/>Wessex wakes Brand up early the next morning, congratulating him on last night's escapades.  Apparently, with the weasels dead, Genevieve has realized that her position is untenable and has agreed that the remaining three members of the Ferndale League will surrender to Wessex ("Why you?" Brand asks) at a ceremony to be held at 10am on the following day.  If things go according to plan, the tunnel should also be finished around then, so it can be a joint Tunnel Opening / Surrender Ceremony, punctuated by Anne singing Anthony's revised version of the Ballad of Caroline.<br/><br/>Over breakfast, Brand passes out assignments to the patrol.  Myrtle is to make sure Anthony finishes the song and that it meets the approval of the Guard. Colin and Winnifred are to watch over the completion of the tunnel, so the Ferndale League doesn't try to escape before they're due to surrender.  Brand is going to try to find Rose Marie.  However, breakfast is interrupted by a very sleepy Anne tugging on Winnifred's tail, asking her if she'd seen Clarence.  Where did she think he would be?  "Oh, well, Brand had told him to keep an eye on the weasels, so maybe he's checking on them."  A knowing look passes between Brand and Colin, before Colin races off to look for Clarence, followed by Winnifred.<br/><br/>Winnifred and Colin discover that Clarence has recovered his pack (minus rocks and rope) and has been traveling around Sprucetuck collecting various items.  Worried that he's going to try something, Colin watches the tunnel digging, since that's one of the few ways out, and Winnifred tells Anne to contact her if Clarence reappears or says anything, since they assume he'll talk to Anne again before doing anything crazy.<br/><br/>Myrtle finds Anthony, who has worked up a new version of the Ballad but it's just not as catchy or powerful anymore, without the subversive political content.  Myrtle asks Anthony what he thinks about the League.  "Which one?"  "Either of them."  "One's crazy and the other's... useless."  So Myrtle nails a Persuader roll and convinces Anthony that his feelings about his sister -- who's probably dead -- don't need to be dragged out in public and used for political purposes, <i>anyone</i>'s political purposes, including the Guard.  So, together, Myrtle and Anthony begin writing a Gilbert &amp; Sullivan-style operetta mocking both Leagues, hoping to destroy whatever vestige of popular support they have.  Anthony rehearses the women's section while Myrtle goes off to recruit some deep male voices... namely, Colin and Brand.<br/><br/>Brand, meanwhile, has discovered that Rose Marie is holed up in the very top of Sprucetuck, in an attic that is used for maintaining the elevators.  All elevator service has stopped since the Ferndale League occupied the settlement, so the elevators are simply suspended together from the ceiling of the hollow tree.  Rose Marie is staring listlessly out the window at the cold spring rain.  There is a great, personal scene between them, where Brand says that he has to take her back to Lockhaven to face a council of captains who will decide her fate.  She laughs and wonders if they'll send the Ferndale League beyond the scent border, where they'll just go back to living like they were before.  Brand says that, despite everything, he'll put in a good word for her, for having acted with leadership in horrible circumstances.  She approaches him and it looks like something sweet might happen, but then Rose Marie rolls 1 more success than Brand and merely says, "I'll think about it" before turning around and effectively kicking him out. ("Dammit!" John said, "I hate her SO MUCH."  But we all knew that Brand was in love with her.)<br/><br/>To be continued...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_199080">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199080/#Comment_199080" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-27T09:06:25+00:00" title="March 27, 2009  9:06AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Anne comes to find Winnifred. "Clarence was just here.  He's going to try to kill the bobcat by himself, because he says you never let him do anything!"  Winnifred rushes towards the tunnel.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Colin is watching the small tunnel opening (it's finished, kinda!) being widened and overhears some of the militia guards saying, "Kid, you can't be in here."  He goes to find Clarence trying to talk his way past, carrying his backpack that's been stuffed full of mail, trailing letters all the way down into the tunnel.  He's got a kitchen knife stuck in his belt, since he lacks a sword.  Colin chews him out for having dropped the mail, sounding very much like Brand lecturing Winnifred in Session 2.  Then their exchange goes like this:<br/><br/>Clarence: "Looks like the tunnel's done."<br/>Colin: "Yup."<br/>Clarence: "So... somebody should probably go and tell Gwendolyn what's happened here."<br/>Colin: "Yup."<br/>Clarence: "And only one of us is going to fit through that hole right now..."<br/>Colin: "... Okay, kid.  Take one lap around the tree, see if you spot the bobcat, and report right back here immediately."<br/>Clarence: "Yes, sir!"<br/><br/>Winnifred, Brand, and Myrtle arrive a few minutes later, having followed the string of letters.  Clarence doesn't return after about 10 minutes.  The young tenderpaws, being the only ones who can fit out the tunnel, go after him, leaving Colin and Brand to start digging the tunnel wider.  Clarence is, of course, going after the bobcat.  Myrtle is chewing him out for having run off alone when Winnifred notices the bobcat watching them from the tree right above them.  They run and the first conflict begins.  They manage to hold the cat off until Colin and Brand spring out, roll their own independent Disposition and begun and two-groups-against-one conflict (which is honestly how I should have run the fight against the feral weasels in Session 5).  In end end, both Winnifred and Colin stab the bobcat but good, succeeding in their goal of driving the beast away from Sprucetuck indefinitely.<br/><br/>We took a player turn at that point, because it seemed silly to wait and take one after the campaign was over.  With the bobcat gone, the spring harvest began and most players decided to remove their "hungry and thirsty" condition by filling their characters' bellies.<br/><br/>Then, we fast-forwarded to the Tunnel Completion / Bobcat Fighting / Surrender / Satirical Operetta Ceremony the next day.  Notably, Rose Marie was not present as the ceremony began. First Sprucetuck honored the architect and the various guilds and militia units responsible for digging the tunnel.  Then the entire patrol was brought up on stage and given bobcat-shaped pins crudely spun out of copper wire (scientists, right?).  Finally, Genevieve came up and gave some half-hearted comments about how she hoped everyone could "put these unfortunate events behind us" and "build a new future together."  She didn't mention the word "surrender" or Wessex or Roland (the mayor of Sprucetuck) or the patrol.<br/><br/>Next came the moment when Anthony and Myrtle's operetta was to begin.  First, Anne came out and began a solo, which was what everyone was expecting.  She was just about to bring in the chorus and break into the satirical parts when a single elevator descended quickly from the top of Sprucetuck, carrying Rose Marie to the middle of the stage, right beside Anne.  Grabbing Wessex's daughter, she threw a lever and began rising quickly back up.  A large rock tied to a rope descended as a counter balance.  The patrol sprang into action.  Brand, Winnifred, and Clarence took to the stairs.  Colin began climbing the dangling rope.  Myrtle and Anthony stepped forward to continue leading the operetta, pretending this was all part of the show.<br/><br/>At the very top of Sprucetuck, there was a dramatic final confrontation, with Rose Marie jumping between the various elevators suspended from the ceiling, dragging Anne along with her.  Her goal was "To turn this whole performance into a debacle."  The patrol's was "To save Anne and capture Rose Marie." Rose Marie Feinted that she was planning to drop Anne a couple times, but Colin, hanging below her, Manuvered against this possibility.  Brand shouted out that everything could still work out, even now, that it was not too late to make the right decision.  Rose Marie threw a bunch of levers, causing some of the elevators to begin descending, but Winnifred threw Clarence on top of a large rock to counterbalance them, so multiple levels of elevators stood dangling in mid-air.  Winnifred leaped out and began grappling with Rose Marie on the top of one of the elevators.  Colin swung up and knocked Rose Marie off, but she grabbed one of the bars of a lower elevator with her tail.<br/><br/>With a Feint that dropped the patrol to Disposition 1 (while she still had 4), she swung up, placed a kiss on Brand's cheek, and then -- giving into her nihilistic impulses -- let go entirely, freefalling towards the stage below.  For the next round, I scripted Attack, Attack, Attack.  The patrol scripted something like Manuver, Attack, Defend.  The Attack-Maneuver exchange led to a stalemate, but Rose Marie blew right through the last of their Disposition in the Attack-Attack exchange.  Since Attack-Attack rolls were independent, however, the only question was whether the patrol could get 4 successes and make Rose Marie lose as well.  Colin tapped a bunch of Nature and Fated some 6s to get the necessary successes, so we ended with what one player called a "Gwen Stacy ending."  Colin swung a dangling elevator to over catch Rose Marie, but she landed with a sickening thud and we all knew she was dead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_199084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199084/#Comment_199084" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-27T09:17:03+00:00" title="March 27, 2009  9:17AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Down below, Myrtle nailed her roll, so the fight upstairs went on while the crowd below was enjoying the operetta.  After the performance was over, the patrol found many discarded "CL" League pins on the ground.<br/><br/>There were four final scenes, wrapping things up, like a non-mechanical final player turn.<br/><br/>Myrtle confronted Wessex about being Caroline's contact in Sprucetuck.  He admitted that they'd traded messages using the woodpecker, but claimed not to know anything about her death, saying that he'd stopped hearing from her over a year ago.  Wessex also said that Caroline was negotiating the Ferndale League's return to Sprucetuck and he had conducted negotiations with the League here out of a feeling of duty to Caroline.  "This surrender," he said, "was what she wanted.  This is for her."  Myrtle walked away, saying, "I hope you got what <i>you</i> wanted out of this, because I don't think anyone else did."<br/><br/>Winnifred and Clarence sat around eating half-ripe spring berries.  Winnifred was telling Clarience that he needs to learn to control himself, to not go off and do crazy things.  They both agreed that Colin and Brand weren't very much fun.  Winnifred said she didn't want anything bad to happen to Clarence.  Clarence said he didn't want anything bad to happen to Winnifred either.  Then they were too embarrassed to continue that conversation and buried their faces in berry.<br/><br/>Colin went to find Brand, who was up in the elevator maintenance room with Rose Marie's body.  Colin said, "Sir, with all due respect, we should probably carry Rose Marie's body to Lockhaven, taking the other Ferndale League members as well, to be tried and punished.  And, of course, tell Gwendolyn what happened."  Brand had a far off look about him, but eventually said, "Yes, guardmouse Colin.  You are right.  That is what we should do.  Will you make the necessary preparations?"  Colin nodded and left.<br/><br/>And that was that.  The patrol had a new mission.<br/><br/>THE END (though we're trying to decide if we can play another season).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_203094">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snikle" title="snikle"><img alt="snikle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snikle">snikle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203094/#Comment_203094" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-22T08:13:56+00:00" title="April 22, 2009  8:13AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds awesome, thanks for posting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
