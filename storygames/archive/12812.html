When I've tried to add Chinese friends to a Mouse Guard or Primetime Adventures game, there seemed to be some sort of cultural or language gap that wasn't easily bridged or explained away; they seemed to feel quite out of their depth. I was unable to find any game on the market which suited any Chinese people I personally knew, with the possible exception of Happy Birthday, Robot, which I was able to modify into a sort of group English-class activity, and for many it was a satisfactory experience, and for a few it was a whole lot of fun.<br/><br/>Once I started designing my own game, however, and trying it out with my younger students, I discovered a very different response. I had been researching Otherkind, Apocalypse World, Donjon, Fate, and many others, and I put together a very basic roleplaying game designed to get 10-11 year-old students speaking in English sentences in a sort of freeform English summer camp class I have. There were problems, as with any game, and I'm still playtesting, trying new things and whatnot, but the kids had such a great time that I'm convinced it would work in this culture for this group of people.<br/><br/>There is a huge segment of kids here around 5th, 6th, and 7th grade who are just amazing learners. They pick up English really fast, and they have very expansive minds that ask tons of questions. Their parents are dissatisfied with the standard rote education system in the schools and yearn for something that can help develop their children's flowering creativity, and foster a desire for learning; but they themselves don't know how to do it. When I started playing this game with these students, it fit this need in a way that I have never witnessed before, and it was really exciting.<br/><br/>Have you ever thought about exporting roleplaying games and storytelling games to other cultures, in a context that those cultures can appreciate? <br/><br/>Can you share insights from any experience you might have in crossing cultures and languages with roleplaying games?<br/><br/>Would you recommend any particular game I might not have thought of for its accessibility for people of a different culture and language?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288449">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288449/#Comment_288449" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-24T07:32:35+00:00" title="August 24, 2010  7:32AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oooh.

Basically, it's a game where the students can try to make their way through a maze, and sort of invent and describe the troubles and opportunities they come to as they go along. There's zero character creation because the students just play themselves, but there's a lot of setting creation on the go. In order to do anything, the kids have to introduce a "story word" to the room they're in, and then they can use that story word to frame goals or dangers, something like you have in <a href="http://www.lumpley.com/archive/148.html" rel="nofollow">Otherkind dice</a>, only I'm using cards instead of dice, because Chinese people play with playing cards all the time and a lot more familiar with them than they are with dice.  <br/><br/>The "story words" act as a kind of anchor for their english ability. For example, suppose one girl draws an Ace card and wins the right to add "giant swan" to a room, then there it is! There's a giant swan there. Now she can frame a goal with that word, like "I want to ride the giant swan" and "I want to make the giant swan my pet." She might not know how to say that in English exactly, but I can get the gist of her meaning and then help her construct the proper sentences. Then she draws the cards and sees if she can get either of these goals or not; each red card equals a successful outcome, but she has to choose which outcome succeeds and which doesn't. Then she narrates what happens by reading the goal again, except she says it in the confirmative, "I ride the giant swan" now (or negative "I don't make the swan my pet"), which helps her solidify that English sentence in her mind and also moves her forward in the game's very elementary fiction. It also tells all the other students what just happened so that they can follow on with their own goals. Sometimes they have to avoid trouble too, with a goal like, "Don't let the dinosaur eat me!" (If they get eaten, they don't die, they just have to find a way out of the dinosaur's belly.)<br/><br/>I think it successfully localized because it doesn't try to impose something western on them, and it doesn't presume fluency in the culture or the language. It's just them, in a maze, and they can put things in it that are meaningful to them, with words they know. They also really enjoy using English in a way that isn't just "make a sentence" or "repeat these words" or "practice this dialogue," but really arises out of their own imagination, which is real to them, in a way. They can feel their creativity expanding and they enjoy learning at the same time.<br/><br/>I also played an earlier version of this with a group of adult teachers, which basically just asked each person to create a two-word description of their character, such as "dangerous frog" or "fire-breathing kumquat," and then narrate various goals and dangers that came to mind, then draw the cards to see if they came true. The story they made was rather bizarre fairy-tale kingdom + talking vegetables sort of adventure, but funny enough that they all had a good time. I gave each person a turn to narrate their character into the story, along with other characters interacting together, and it led to some interesting twists and turns. I wished there were something more for the players to do when it wasn't their turn, but all of them were patient enough and they seemed to enjoy just watching the story unfold. I think the key was letting it come from them, not me, and presenting it in a way that everyone could follow easily. Also, the mechanics forced them to first outline possible outcomes and then choose between the ones that were most important to them, and that really worked. It felt fair and interesting every time, even if just to watch what someone else chose.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288453">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288453/#Comment_288453" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-24T08:02:49+00:00" title="August 24, 2010  8:02AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kayfall</cite>Can you share insights from any experience you might have in crossing cultures and languages with roleplaying games?</blockquote>\nYeah, so while EVERYONE gets stories, so "story games" might be a good cultural gaming toy... Everyone in Asia also understands console RPGs as well. HP, MP, attacks, fantasy and goblins, most folks in our generation Get This already. So if the goal is to get them into role-playing, I'd almost want to start with a dirt-simple fantasy RPG (Dungeon Squad, for example) as an English crossover tool: Since there's not a lot of high-character-roleplay, the students can think of simple or complex sentences and "execute" them.<br/><br/>So, when I taught English in Japan, I did a few experiments with RPGs in the classroom. One of the more interesting ones for low-level (but interested) students was basically a combination of Zork and Parseley/Action Castle:<br/><br/>* Each class was divided into 3 "teams". Each "team" controlled one of three stick-figure characters on the board. <br/><br/>* Each figure started in the same room. The "dungeon" I planned was about 5 rooms large, with various things in it (refrigerator, treasure, etc).<br/><br/>* Each student received a small paper with various verbs on it that they learned up until that point (about 20-30 or so). <br/><br/>* A student from Team A spoke a sentence to control their character. Then Team B, Then Team C, etc. Each time, a new student had to give the command. This meant that students good at English could just bust out freestyle, while students not so good knew when it was their turn, so beforehand they could think about their sentences, ask friends on their team for help, etc.<br/><br/>In the end, it was to reinforce some English lessons: Seriously nothing motivating as controlling and responding to a figure through the power of something you just learned, this is the same reason why video games are so addictive. It was a fun, conventional exercise with some points of student innovation:<br/><br/>For example, near the end, one of the team's figures pulled a level. This opened a giant pit, which they fell into. There were spikes at the bottom. Much laughter as I drew the figure falling, then the result (lots of red chalk used). The funny thing is, the team still had students who hadn't gone yet, so on the next round, I went to the next member of that team, a boy who was "okay" with English, but never seem that motivated.<br/><br/>He had this HUGE grin on his face, and he said "I want to FIGHT!" (the lesson I was drilling in at the time was "I want to..." and "I would like to"). "Fight" wasn't written on their papers. He was using it in the kind of wasei-eigo English loanword style of "to struggle on" (visual refrence of "FIGHT!/FAITO!" <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htC82hW6dVc&amp;feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htC82hW6dVc&amp;feature=related</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YayzB02zccI&amp;feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YayzB02zccI&amp;feature=related</a>).<br/><br/>So I basically had his team's character, despite being stabbed a million times with spikes, basically crawl his way out of the pit again, leaving a bloody trail. <br/><br/>Sometimes the innovation of language learners can really sneak up on you.<br/><br/>I can see using more story-focused games for very small lessons (tutoring, 2-5 students only), but for larger groups this sort of Parseley-like thing went a long way.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kayfall" title="Kayfall"><img alt="Kayfall" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kayfall">Kayfall</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288455/#Comment_288455" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-24T08:29:02+00:00" title="August 24, 2010  8:29AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, that's really cool, Andy, thanks!

You basically create a few rooms Zork-style in your head, then have folks describe themselves doing one thing at a time, in order, reacting to the last thing described. It's not a "set game" or anything, but I've been doing it 12 years before Parsely saw print.  Also, Action Castle/True ZORK-style emulation games will likely infuriate/disappoint your English students because they punish exploration/vivid reacting to the world in a favor of a classic Infocom style "You Can't Do That"/"I Don't Understand That Command"/"Does. Not. Compute" style of play. So, even if you get Action Castle (which is cute, for English speakers; I've run and played with friends) I'd never recommend running it for someone who never played Infocom games in a language that isn't their first language, unless you wanted to basically beat all their interest in English out of them forever.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kayfall" title="Kayfall"><img alt="Kayfall" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kayfall">Kayfall</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288465/#Comment_288465" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-24T09:01:29+00:00" title="August 24, 2010  9:01AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh yeah, I wasn't thinking of using the Zork language directly, but thinking of it as a sort of guide that I could adapt for my students. I would use the concept of giving the students a strict set of "commands" they could use, but frame the language in another way, something like:<br/><br/>I want to...<br/><br/>run / walk<br/>...to the ___.<br/>...from the ___.<br/><br/>attack the ___.<br/><br/>use the ___ <br/>...with the ___.<br/>...on the ___.<br/><br/>words:<br/>door<br/>zombie<br/>sword<br/>torch<br/>fire<br/><br/>The idea would be to give them basic sentence structures for the low-level students, and frame every problem so that it's possible to solve it using some combination of these sentences. This wouldn't work for the higher-level English students, but right now my main problem is with the lower-level ones, who really have a hard time just understanding how to play the game. The language of Zork itself wouldn't work, but the principle involved in the Parsely style of play could work great. I certainly wouldn't say things like "does not compute."<br/><br/>Maybe you're right, I don't need to buy Action Castle. But if I did have it, perhaps I could easily adapt it to a more forgiving style of play that would suit my students.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288585">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288585/#Comment_288585" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-24T18:41:22+00:00" title="August 24, 2010  6:41PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's a vote for more mad libs-style story games! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kayfall" title="Kayfall"><img alt="Kayfall" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kayfall">Kayfall</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288598/#Comment_288598" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-24T20:05:34+00:00" title="August 24, 2010  8:05PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah! So here are a few ways to make the games more playable to people from another culture: <br/><br/>-If you can, design your game so that the story comes from the players. It absolutely needs structure and guidance, but players need a lot of agency in order to maintain interest. Mechanics like Otherkind are great because they let the players establish what they are willing to risk, and they can be learned in seconds. <br/><br/>-The game should not require them to understand a specific terminology or culture. Primetime Adventures, for example, is a great game that doesn't work in this regard, because you have to be very familiar with western TV and its structures (with concepts like "pilot episode" and "season"). Chinese television shows, for example, don't have seasons -- they just run for as many episodes as their producers want them to run for; and although it's hard to explain exactly why or how, I have a feeling that Chinese television programs have a very different place in Chinese society compared to US television.<br/><br/>-Your game can draw on themes and principles shared between your cultures, such as computer RPG tropes like dungeons, hit points, and fighting monsters. But in doing this you should remember that not everyone in the other culture accesses these themes the same way -- a teenage kid in China is much more likely to understand computer game tropes than a 20-something friend who grew up with different values (it seems to me that computer games only took off in China after 2000). It's good if your game allows the players to establish the tropes themselves, without too much discussion or trouble.<br/><br/>-If your game is to be played in English, or a language that is not their own, then it's got to give the players guidelines as to what they can do and how they should say what they should do. Questions like "what do you want to do?" are not as effective as, "do you want to fight or run or do something else?" If possible, integrate the use of the language into the mechanics of the game itself, and reward the kind of language use you'd like to see more of. <br/><br/>What else am I missing? Are there other issues I should think about?<br/><br/>Also, one question I've never seen discussed before: What about other countries as a market for story games?

I have no idea why. People I have talked to have generally heard of Dungeons and Dragons the tabletop RPG (as opposed to a computer game variety) but never played it themselves. Generally, they haven't heard of any other roleplaying games than that one, that I know of. I'm sure out there somewhere, there are Chinese people hanging out on a forum like this one -- the country is just SO HUGE that there's got to be someone somewhere doing something like this, but they may be facing more difficulties than we face in the west, because the publishing industry is strictly controlled by the government. There is no such thing as small-press indie publishing, unless you go to the local copy-machine/printing store and get books printed yourself; and then in that case it's not a "book" like what you would see in a book store, but the sort of thing you could have made at Kinko's back in the USA. They have their own version of eBay called Tao Bao, where they could sell these games, in a small-press sort of way, I suppose. Perhaps I should try to investigate if anyone is selling something like this there. I would be SO happy if I could somehow find a group of Chinese storygamers. That would make my month.<br/><br/>As far as Japan is concerned though, I understand they do have a serious gaming industry, and there are definitely interesting innovations going on there. <a href="http://www.tenra-rpg.com/" rel="nofollow">Tenra Bansho Zero</a> is the latest Japanese RPG I've heard of, newly translated and demoed at the most recent Gencon. They have a lot of other things too, as well as many Western games based on Japanese cultural properties (Is "Maid" a Japanese game or a Western one?). <br/><br/>Unfortunately, I think the RPG industry in many countries is pretty much zero. But then, you know Mahjong is a huge deal in China and in the US, you hardly ever see anyone playing or talking about it, except in the "Shanghai Mahjong" computer game where you match tiles to remove them from the board. I suppose the US is multicultural enough that you can buy a proper Mahjong set and play if you learn the rules if you look around hard enough, but many countries just don't have the same level of inter-cultural sharing. If it's not part of either local culture or mainstream global culture (including mainly big-market brands like Disney, Coca Cola, Nike, and whatnot), then they just don't know much about it nor have any access to it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288639">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288639/#Comment_288639" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-25T04:29:00+00:00" title="August 25, 2010  4:29AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            thanks, this is a great discussion. i wish i had more to add.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288687">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288687/#Comment_288687" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-25T08:06:40+00:00" title="August 25, 2010  8:06AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 25, 2010 8:07AM by Andy.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kayfall</cite>As far as I know, there aren't any RPGs coming out of China.

The largest RPG company in Japan, with the highest-selling games, has its offices in two apartments in one building (one is the office and workspace, one is the storage/warehousing). The second-largest RPG company (which I have a bunch of friends at) is just one apartment building large.<br/><br/>But there are innovations going on. They've been doing this "Story Game" thing since 1994 with games like Tokyo Nova, Tenra Bansho and others (traditional games with very strong GM, but lots of mechanics about personality and story elements, including strong scene framing at least a decade before PTA).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kayfall</cite><a href="http://www.tenra-rpg.com/" rel="nofollow">Tenra Bansho Zero</a>is the latest Japanese RPG I've heard of, newly translated and demoed at the most recent Gencon.

China skipped the super-famicon and home video game systems almost entirely, going straight to networked computers in internet cafes playing Red Alert and Starcraft, circa the mid 1990s.  When I was there in high school in 1998, the only home video game systems I saw were bootleg/pirated ones that played really old pre-Super Famicon games like classic Nintendo and Atari titles.  And even then, most of those were played by 8yo kids, not teenagers.<br/><br/>Remember, the Cultural Revolution only officially ended in the late seventies, so in the eighties and early 90s, most youth were worried about whether they would have jobs or a future or be able to buy Nike shoes, not playing video games.  And there was all the political activism surrounding 1986-1989 and the subsequent backlash, so China is much, MUCH later on awakening to all this.  The Chinese rock music scene started around 1986 or so and peaked around the same time as the youth activism, suffering a pretty long drought through the 90s-00s and only just witnessing a resurgence in the last few years.<br/><br/>D&amp;D got to China through translations published in Hong Kong, originally.  I'm pretty much 100% sure there was no D&amp;D published on the mainland before 3E.  I have never see it sold anywhere, so it's possible most 3E got to the mainland through HK as well.  It's possible that Ben, David, or Rich have better info on this; I'm not sure.  Roleplaying in China is an even smaller hobby than in Japan, and by a longshot, so it's not too surprising China has published no original tabletop RPGs that we've heard of.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288738">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kayfall" title="Kayfall"><img alt="Kayfall" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kayfall">Kayfall</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288738/#Comment_288738" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-25T10:05:01+00:00" title="August 25, 2010 10:05AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 25, 2010 10:06AM by Kayfall.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're probably right about a lot of this Jon. I came to China in 2000, and have been living here ever since, and I didn't see or hear any mention of roleplaying until only the last couple years or so.<br/><br/>Here's the thing, though: I believe this market is ripe for story games more than traditional RPGs, as long as these games are designed and presented as tools for getting kids to explore their creativity and practice English, and maybe also as an activity that parents and children can do together. Once they do it with their kids, I think the hobby could take off with adults amongst themselves as well, but I'm not sure. Either way, once people see it being done successfully, they're likely to copy it, do it their own way, and go off in who knows what directions.<br/><br/>And by the way, Andy, congratulations on translating that game! It's a great service to work on something like that, not only to provide an awesome game but bridge two cultures as well. It brings the influence the West has had on Japan in this regard back full circle, so that Japan can start influencing the West!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288891/#Comment_288891" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-25T20:17:04+00:00" title="August 25, 2010  8:17PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 25, 2010 8:18PM by Emily_Care.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for sharing this.

Spent some time there visiting. Fast forward a couple years and I met my wife, who is from Thailand. I think both societies have an extreme potential to embrace table top gaming. RPGs, board games and card games. But simply exporting english language games, poorly translated, with their mainly western themes is way too much of a disconnect without there being someone right there in te trenches to do some grass roots teachings.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, I very much plan to start a hobby game retail chain in Thailand, then eventually China. It'll be something along the same concepts as our current retail store in Madison Heights, combining retail and POD printing. Most specifically because while we will import some games to retail there, for the industries to really launch, games will need to be published locally, in the local languages and with themes that can culturally connect with the local players. So when we are ready to try our first store over there, it will only be after I have published some of our own game systems (first in Thai, but soon to follow in Chinese), board, card and RPGs and our "retail" store there will print and produce them onite. Have to keep things economically priced to suit the local market and importing expensive games from the US would price too many items out of the local markets.<br/>\n<br/>\nAmerican culture changed, a LOT, over the last 25 years. Evolution of technologies, greater demand for working hours in the work place, the internet, the fast rise of video games and many other factors tore apart much of the average persons ability to sit down and engage in much face to face gaming. But in spite of continued advances in video game tech and the internet, I think the "shinny" on all that has worn off a bit and sitting down to do some gaming is making something of a come back. However, from my experience, I think Thailand and China both have existant cultures that still put a greater emphasis and family, social time spent with friends, ect which means they should be ripe for hobby gaming in most of their forms (due to space and the economics thereof, just not sure about miniature gaming. Maybe just needs the right game lines...).<br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of countries may have hobby games and cottage hobby game industries, but it sure hasn't gone global yet. But I fully expect it will. I think its merely something that will be spread more slowly and can't spread like wildfire like some digital media can today. The manner in how one learns and how games are played just can't be spread well online.<br/>\n<br/>\nRyan<br/>\nGOB                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289049">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289049/#Comment_289049" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-26T19:26:19+00:00" title="August 26, 2010  7:26PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ryan, David and all.

I'm reading it now. It might be suitable for my advanced English students, but I may also have to modify it from a "say whatever you like on this theme" to a more structured "make a sentence with these words" sort of thing. I'll let you know how it goes if it works!<br/><br/>Jon, do you still have the address of that forum? I'd love to check it out myself. Did you learn Chinese? <br/><br/>Ryan, your ideas sound really cool. I haven't quite seen a "hobby store" as such here yet, at least not the same sort of thing you see in the west. However, according to <a href="http://www.china.org.cn/culture/2009-02/18/content_17297012.htm" rel="nofollow">this article</a> Chinese are starting to really get into board games and card games and things, especially this game called Sanguo Sha (or "Three Kingdoms Killers") which is based on the western game "Bang!" only set in the Three Kingdoms period of Chinese history rather than the Wild West. Have you heard anything about that? It might work better to open a sort of Board Games Cafe, where people can get together and play the latest games and drink tea for some time rather than a hobby store where people take these things back home and play. People often prefer to meet in public restaurants and cafes and things rather than coming over to one another's houses (which might have something to do with the fact that people are pretty crowded together here and apartments tend to be a bit small).<br/><br/>Hans, and everyone, I think some Chinese are definitely open to Western themes and settings, but others are not. I would guess that the number of Chinese who are into Dogs in the Vineyard as written would be less than those who are interested in something with a more local flavor, in spite of what they said on the forum Jon mentioned. When the topic of Western religions like Mormonism comes up with my friends, I'd say just about one third are interested in it at least as something of a curiosity, while the majority tend to feel as though it's not their thing, just not something Chinese people associate with. Sometimes they're afraid that the government will still look down on anything people do that has any association to religion at all, and that's a factor too. Then again, some people don't even think about any of that and just play whatever seems cool! So it's really a mixture.<br/><br/>That said, something like Mist-Robed Gate isn't necessarily a shoe-in either. The setting might work just fine, but there could be something just a little off about it that strikes Chinese as not right somehow, like if you ever see Americans as portrayed in Indian Bollywood movies, for example... something about them seems just not real at all. Also, something about the creativity involved in the mechanics might strike people as too difficult or awkward. I can't say, since I haven't played this particular game, but any game we try needs to be tested a lot. What some Western people think is a fun chance to goof around might seem like a potentially embarrassing situation to some Chinese. There are very different sorts of social norms about when to share your ideas and when to be silent among many sections of society, and any roleplaying game designed for people here needs to keep those in mind.<br/><br/>My goal for game design here at the moment is to create games that are sort of setting-neutral, in that they either have no setting at all, and the process of quick character creation and play itself defines the setting, or the setting is something neither Western nor Chinese, such as a maze, or a lost world of dinosaurs, or a sci-fi planet or something. <br/><br/>Also, when we design a game for Chinese, we need to keep in mind what physical space it is to be played in, in addition to the shared imagined space. People will not play a game that involves getting together in one another's homes if they feel their homes are too small and unimpressive to show to their friends, for instance. My goal at the moment is to create or adapt games for the classroom first, because that's my job, but after that, I think it would be important to consider other spaces carefully as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289118">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289118/#Comment_289118" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-27T06:56:23+00:00" title="August 27, 2010  6:56AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            With the goal of setting-neutrality in mind, I'm curious what you think about Do: Pilgrims of the Flying Temple actually works for Chinese players.

Or PTA style stuff where the games draw on TV or movie tropes that are near-universal now.  In general, I think it's probably better to ask Chinese gamers what they're interested in rather than speculating independently.<br/><br/><b>David:</b> The Chinese language TRPG forum I was on for a while has since closed down or moved.  One of my contact folks was Keith Yim, who edited this zine called <a href="http://www.cndkc.net/bbs/thread-29104-1-1.html" rel="nofollow">Visionary</a> (no Chinese language title, AFAIK), which publishes a mix of original content and fan translations of official English language TRPG materials.  From searching a bit, it seems like they may now be based at this forum, <a href="https://www.deathwinter.com/forum.php?s=1b17414b70e818abcc393ddb40af40f7" rel="nofollow">Deathwinter</a>, but I'm not sure.  In general, I find that if you search for "TRPG" in Chinese language search engines, you can find a fair amount, or just "\u9f99\u4e0e\u5730\u4e0b\u57ce".<br/><br/>Both Ben Lehman (designer of Polaris etc.) and I were in China for a fair bit, and Nanjing specifically, but at completely different times.  I did a Fulbright in 2004-2005 at Nanda researching the Taiping Rebellion.  Then I moved to Boston, where Ben already was, and worked for three years doing research on China for a start-up think-tank.  We're both currently China Studies MA students at the University of Washington, so basically I follow Ben around the world, about a year late <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  My girlfriend just moved out here, though, so I think I'm settled for a bit.

I think our goal shouldn't be to amaze, but to inspire. Once there's some sort of communication of insights between their genius game designers and our own, then we'll have some really amazing things happening.<br/><br/>Thanks for the forum links.

If Gary and crew had been in China today and first published D&amp;D, after the first few thousand copies sold you would likely have folks in most major cities copying those books themselves and selling them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts all nice and fine for us, who have grown up with hobby gaming being available to us our entire lives, to sit here and idealize the activity and the creation process behind the games we play, but none of that would likely have become possible without TSR, ICE, Mayfair Games, WOTC and the march of companies, present and long gone, having had at least the realistic incentive that they would profit from the hard work they put into making their products.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is, frankly, why when I attempt to push gaming in both countries, I am starting from the position of the retailer and POD producer. Unless copyright enforcement drastically improves in either country, approaching it as a publisher will quickly prove to be unsustainable if even one product sells enough to catch the imagination of the would-be gamers there. Commercial copyright theft will have everyone else copying and selling the thing. But as a POD printer of short run items and as the retailer, I will neither produce said illegal reproductions for people nor give them a shelf to sell from. To a degree, I will be able to guarantee my slice of the gaming world and the profits from my own translation efforts and publishing by establishing the production arm and retail arms of the fledgling industry. It won't stop people from copying the games, printing them elsewhere and then selling them elsewhere, but so long as I only print hard copies and don't sell digitals, at least reproductions will be second generation reproductions. And as long as I build a good solid retail business, the illegal copies "sold elsewhere" will ultimately help to build general awareness of the existence of such games, which will help draw customers to the dedicated stores for said products.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou'll know the market is rapidly exanding there, however, when you sell the emergence of a competive chain of retail stores. No idea how long that will take to see happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nRyan S.
