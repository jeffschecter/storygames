One of the more interesting things to arise from that has been the mission maps, which are essentially duals of relationship maps:<br/><br/>In a relationship map you have nodes which are people, things, and so on. And then you draw lines between them (vertices in the technical sense) indicating the relationships between the nodes. The Drift mission maps turn that on its head: the nodes are relationships (really commonalities - Cultural truths or Technological insights) and the lines between are the people and situations involved in the mission. <br/><br/>The advantages of that are that these truths and insights are also precisely the mechanical features you need to know about any NPC or situation. This started out as a rapid way to link characters and situations together and produce interesting mission situations based on a handful of truths and insights (which are typically based on the planet the mission occurs on). And it does this quite well.<br/><br/>But now I've been thinking about how to do more with it. Specifically to use the mission map as a dynamic chart of the mission progress. As any play (including the GM) succeeds on actions with the situations and people, they can (in addition to forcing more direct outcomes) add some number of tokens to one of the two nodes linked by the person or situation or remove tokens from those nodes (up to 3 on any node). <br/><br/>Once you have your three tokens on both nodes you can resolve that person or situation, essentially as a free narration. And that locks that person or situation in, it cannot be directly affected by the tokens again, unless one of his, her, or its nodes changes - which can only happen if one of the related people or situations is affected first.<br/><br/>There are two concerns about this: <br/><br/>1) I'm not sure how to end missions without it being a let down, especially a final tug-of-war between the GM and the players over a few nodes. I could see some free currency stemming from resolutions, which can turn a few sequential victories into a rout (to be specific - free impetus). <br/><br/>2) If the mission doesn't conclude with a total victory, what happens to the situations or persons trapped between the two sides? I can see this being unresolved or open. Or that things are worst when trapped this way. There are some reasons to leave room for re-occuring characters, but some of the tropes of Drift makes that difficult (30 year or so transit times before you return to the planet). <br/><br/>   - Mendel S.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59861">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce" title="Dave Younce"><img alt="Dave Younce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g232/thomastamblyn/Avatars/GoPlayDice.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce">Dave Younce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59861/#Comment_59861" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-08T06:43:35+00:00" title="March  8, 2007  6:43AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's cool - it reminds me of the fact that d12s and d20s are the same shape except the corners and sides are reversed. If you draw a d20 as a graph/relmap, you'll get 12 nodes (each corresponding to a 'corner' of the polyhedron), draw a d12 that way &amp; you'll get 20 nodes. (both graphs have 30 edges; both dice have 30 edges).  Probably doesn't help you a bit - just got me thinking.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_59864">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59864/#Comment_59864" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-08T06:56:57+00:00" title="March  8, 2007  6:56AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 8, 2007 7:07AM by wyrmwood.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The mathematician in me wants to point out that the same is true about the d8 and d6 (cubes and octahedrons are duals in that same sense). And tetrahedra (d4) are self-dual. Admitedly, d10s, I believe, are dual to a sort of twisted pentagonal prism, but we can't all be platonic solids.<br/><br/>   - Mendel S.<br/><br/>(edited to clarify - the since d10s are just d12s with two opposite faces replaced with 5-sided pyramids, the dual looks like an elongated d20 with the two vertices on opposite sides "shaved" off". It looks like an odd gem cut basically, with pentagonal cylinders on the sides and a circle of d20 style triangle faces around the center. I'm not sure that has any use, but is valguely similar to the gem-style dice you see occasionally.<br/><br/>Admittedly, this sort of face to vertex duality is one approach to duality. The one I'm talking about is a graph theory based one where you exchange your links and nodes, (technically vertices and edges). But I find the general concept of a dual to be very useful - namely transforming a structure to see it from a different perspective.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59914">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sempiternity" title="Sempiternity"><img alt="Sempiternity" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.personal.psu.edu/bcp5010/stefan2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sempiternity">Sempiternity</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59914/#Comment_59914" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-08T10:51:12+00:00" title="March  8, 2007 10:51AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 8, 2007 10:54AM by Sempiternity.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mendel,<br/><br/>If a character is trapped, unresolved, at the end of a mission and then left to rot in slow time when the ship leaves, couldn't you transfer that very non-resolution onto the planet's "big picture"? <br/><br/>That's kind of an ugly phrase, but i want it to mean that the character who is left unresolved becomes an issue for that planet, next time the ship visits it. If something is left unresolved it grows and festers. (Kind of a multi-generational "we-owe" list, really...)<br/><br/>Not really sure if that sort of escalation is applicable to Drift, but thought i'd throw it out (again)!<br/><br/>(Edit: By the way, i love the idea for this game!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_59938">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59938/#Comment_59938" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-08T11:54:42+00:00" title="March  8, 2007 11:54AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Worlds in Drift are described by a list of seven truths, which represent the different cultural ideas and tendencies of the planet's inhabitants (well it could be a moon or a station, or what not). So for example, when you were recruited from Epsilon Gamma Phi Gamma it had the following truths:<br/><br/>Aspiration: Knowledge<br/>Aspiration: Peace<br/>The Great Wheel<br/>Sin: Self-Denial<br/>Virtue: Instinct<br/>Virtue: Reason<br/>Virtue: Strength<br/><br/>with a sharp dichotemy between the night cycle and the day cycle of the station (a Dr. Jekyl / Mr. Hyde sort of dichotemy).  After a circuit when you return to that world again, it will change one of its truths, lets say making the place more free-wheeling at night, and less winner-takes-all:<br/><br/>Aspiration: Chaos<br/>Aspiration: Knowledge<br/>Aspiration: Peace<br/>The Great Wheel<br/>Sin: Self-Denial<br/>Virtue: Instinct<br/>Virtue: Reason<br/><br/>At least that's how things work right now. I was considering linking the changes to these truths with the outcomes of the mission, success or failure. But I really can't link that at the same time as linking unresolved people and situations with those changes. Frankly, I'm warming up to the later idea though. <br/><br/>I'm also thinking of adding a shorter list of insights (technological aspects) to the planet. If so, the change could arise using the following technique:<br/><br/>Each person or situation in the mission map uniquely links two truths or insights, if those nodes are won by opposite sides, leaving that link unresolved, then one of those two must go. The players decide what goes, but the GM decides what replaces it. <br/><br/>This works because the list of truths and insights for a world is also the list from which the GM draws in the first place to build the mission map. And so, those unresolved links will have a direct effect on the tenor of future missions on that world. And the more you leave unresolved, the more quickly your homeworld becomes utterly alien to you (that process is where the name Drift actually comes from). <br/><br/>  - Mendel S.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
