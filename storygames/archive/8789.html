Even though people out there might well be playing the games they buy, they do not keep online logs and if you want to find out about games from reviews you're unlikely to make much headway as most reviews are written by people who have read but not played the games (and even then, most online games reviews are of a terrifically low standard).<br/><br/>I'd like to see online gaming focus less on buying and selling stuff and more on actual play.<br/><br/>For example, our group keep wikis for each of our games with details on player characters, sessions and settings.  Thereby making it easier to come back to the games after a break and also providing support for the wider community if they want to see what a Buffy, Te Deum pour un Massacre or Space 1889 game looks like.<br/><br/>Given that gamers love swapping war stories, I'm surprised that this trend has not taken off more than it has.  How awesome would it be if every group of gamers kept an online campaign log?<br/><br/>Thoughts, feelings?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194511">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194511/#Comment_194511" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-26T13:00:55+00:00" title="February 26, 2009  1:00PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actual play over sales?<br/><br/>Fucking yes, please!<br/><br/>Rock on.<br/><br/>I concur.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_194519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194519/#Comment_194519" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-26T13:21:03+00:00" title="February 26, 2009  1:21PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?board=14.0" rel="nofollow">Here</a> you can find a great resource with over 3.500 actual play threads with a lot of games.

Enthusiasm is contagious.  I think part of the problem is that an actual play report* can be any or all of:<br/><br/>Marketing<br/>Misguided enthusiasm <br/>A cautionary tale<br/>Tedious <br/>A window into a game's at-table feel<br/>A window into some dude's obtuseness <br/>Impossible to parse<br/>Insightful commentary<br/>A blow by blow of what my guy did<br/>A treasure trove of practical, technique-based information<br/><br/>So there's not a whole lot of value in a play report as a class. It might be awesome, it might be shit, it's entirely subjective, and if there were 100 instead of one I'm not sure I'd be better informed.  I certainly would become a more discriminating reader.<br/><sub><br/>*ECB pointed out recently that the "actual" in this construction can be construed as actively offensive.

Partly because most people don't actually write that well and partly because it's a lot of text in a not particularly easy-to-digest way.  A site with pages for characters, sessions and maybe side notes is a much more helpful way of doing it.  Much more inspirational too if you're maybe looking for ideas for a game you want to run.<br/><br/>However, I think that if these types of things were in wider use then cross-fertilisation of effective techniques would take place.  For example, our wiki have gone through various upgrades and cross-fertilisations and we've learned from each other as to what works best as a means of displaying information.  If this were opened out into a much wider community then I think improvements would happen quite quickly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_194565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194565/#Comment_194565" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-26T14:23:49+00:00" title="February 26, 2009  2:23PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of my groups keeps its stuff <a href="http://meekmok.com/games/rpg/" rel="nofollow">here</a>, sort of erratically.

That is, I hit a stumbling point, or there's a problem at the table, or I can't get my head around what to do next. That's the only time I ever construct actual play reports, really. Sometimes, rarely, I post when something particularly cool *and reproducable* happened, and I want to share what I did, and how it was reproducable, so that other people might attempt it as well at some point.<br/><br/>Otherwise, if I take notes, it's always on paper: And I rarely have time to post those notes online. Just too much "work not tied up in helping our group play".<br/><br/>But if asked (or if anyone posts, "Help me with my X game", where X is a game I'm really familiar with, have played in the past, etc), I'll totally spill AP details.<br/><br/>I too sometimes feel guilty about perpetrating the idea of these "what games are new/coming soon" threads as important milestones, but they're, I dunno, fun little things to keep track of.

It also goes part and parcel with the fact that for many of us creating games is as fun, or in some cases more fun, than playing them (both play and game authoring are creative activities, and some people like one more than the other). That love of creation drives the constant production of new game after new game, where in fact its quite possible that most of us could find a game already out there to do everything we want at the table. The cycle of new game after new game makes the faddy interest in whatever is new also inevitable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_194602">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194602/#Comment_194602" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-26T14:51:20+00:00" title="February 26, 2009  2:51PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with shreyas that it may be rare - I know I feel it relatively rarely - but what's interesting to me is that war stories and AP posts don't interest me as much as an in-depth conversation about a fairly sizable segment of play.

However, there are two very different kinds of "Actual Play" posts.  I've done both.  Consider this set of posts I made at RPG.net.<br/><br/><a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=294465" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=294465</a><br/><br/>What I did there was basically log the fiction, scene by scene, of a Primetime Adventures games I ran.  There is very little about the game, how it played, what the people did, etc.  I pretty much put it up both as an archive for myself as well as a curiosity for others.<br/><br/>Contrast that with this post I made at The Forge:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=27595.0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=27595.0</a><br/><br/>There's very little discussion of the fiction in that post but a ton about how the game interacted with the creative goals of the group.  Discussion of the fiction created is only present where it serves and as an example of the dynamic being discussed.<br/><br/>That second post is generally the kind of stuff the AP forum at The Forge is supposed to be like and that's the primary reason I didn't post the PtA stuff at RPG.net instead of there.<br/><br/>So when you say more focus on Actual Play what in particular are you referring to?

I wonder if I can mine someone else's game for ideas?" or, in a more traditional AP way "I wonder what that game is like in longer play?"<br/><br/>I know that I've asked myself every single one of those questions.<br/><br/>I also know that I've been inspired by other people's games.<br/><br/>The value to be gained from keeping public gaming logs aren't obvious in the short term but they're more tangible in the long term, particularly if the behaviour becomes popular.  It's a bit like picking up trash... there's little point in you doing it if nobody else does but if everyone starts doing it soon you have a clean street.  Keeping public logs adds to the commons of gaming; it fosters a sense of community, it gains you social capital and it's actually quite cool.  While our group's wikis aren't much compared to some other people's, I'm damn proud of the stories we've told and the thought that has gone into those dozens and dozens of hours of gaming.  When I visit a wiki and I see that I get like 5 hits a day, I smile to myself.  Thats something that my friends and I have done and which might well have inspired someone else to go and have fun of their own.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_194613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20M" title="Jonathan M"><img alt="Jonathan M" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20M">Jonathan M</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194613/#Comment_194613" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-26T15:02:02+00:00" title="February 26, 2009  3:02PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite><br/>So when you say more focus on Actual Play what in particular are you referring to?

Not "actual play" as in "actual play" the type of forum post.  Though the second is an example of the first.<br/><br/>I think that forums (and they're all like this to a lesser or greater extent) tend to focus upon buying stuff because it's something that's easy to bond over.  Anyone can spend months discussing what they hope is in some Exalted supplement and everyone can get excited about picking the book up and looking at it.  That's a lot easier to build a community around than buying the book, reading the book, digesting the book and integrating it into your campaign.  This has created, in my eyes, a kind of shadow hobby made up of people who are 'gamers' but who never actually play.<br/><br/>I think that it would be nice to focus the online gaming community not upon the point of sale, but upon the interesting bit, namely playing the games.  Discussing how the games perform in play is one part of that, describing your campaigns is another.<br/><br/>To my mind, anything that is about play instead of about buying stuff is a good thing and encouraging people to share their play through the use of public logs or AP reports (caveat what I said above) is a way of doing that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194629">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194629/#Comment_194629" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-26T15:27:14+00:00" title="February 26, 2009  3:27PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>you don't know anything about what I am interested in and when.</blockquote>I can't speak for Shreyas but I read his <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> comment to mean that <i>it's rare to find that level of interest in the play of others</i> in a person rather than meaning <i>you, Judd, feel that level of interest rarely</i>.<br/>Even if I'm interpreting him correctly, I'm not sure whether I agree or not.

I took the test and everything, and I'm like 5-10% audial, 50% visual, 40% tactile-kinesthetic.*<br/><br/>Now, on the other hand, I've found this sort of thing happening: I have interest in a game, and want to know more about it. I ask for people to tell me what they've done with it. I look for some really cool things (in the replies) that indicate something awesome that the game helped them do. From THAT point, if they're like, "If you want to see more, check out my 6-page play report", I'll totally give it a peek.<br/><br/>But yeah, that's another way of saying, "I start a conversation with that person" (...but on the Internet instead of In Person).<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194637/#Comment_194637" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-26T15:38:37+00:00" title="February 26, 2009  3:38PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So I put a * in my above post, I just realized an anecdote based on both my learning/media preferences and AP reports:<br/><br/>When people post PICTURES from their games, with a few lines about how it went, I'm all over that shit.<br/>When Harper posted his Savage Worlds and D&amp;D monstrosity games with all the pictures, he also included a ton of text as well, which I tore up, because I had some visual stimulus.<br/><br/>Damn, it might be as simple as, "I don't really get my kicks from reading actual play posts, because I suck at learning through reading; I need to see or do it: Whereas seeing or doing it (doing it can mean "having a friend face to face go through the motions of what happened) really appeal to me far, far more than it might to other people."<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_194643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194643/#Comment_194643" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-26T15:43:47+00:00" title="February 26, 2009  3:43PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My thoughts on writing great actual play posts <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=61503" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194648">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20M" title="Jonathan M"><img alt="Jonathan M" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20M">Jonathan M</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194648/#Comment_194648" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-26T15:49:04+00:00" title="February 26, 2009  3:49PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite><br/>When people post PICTURES from their games, with a few lines about how it went, I'm all over that shit.<br/>When Harper posted his Savage Worlds and D&amp;D monstrosity games with all the pictures, he also included a ton of text as well, which I tore up, because I had some visual stimulus.<br/></blockquote>\nAs somebody who regularly writes 2000 word essays about thing, I totally agree and think that presentation is a vital skill in making your play report seem interesting.

Although, if I remember right, sometimes information is erased and replaced on piecemeal basis.  So a complete AP (i.e., one with a full history of the game, not just the final state) would often contain redundant information (e.g., reproductions of the map at different ages).  And for any self-APing game session, there's a potential problem that it sucks to record details that end up not significantly affecting the awesome part of the session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194819/#Comment_194819" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-27T16:38:23+00:00" title="February 27, 2009  4:38PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Guys, it's not just about actual play threads, it's about play focussed posting generally.<br/><br/>So, a thread for tips on running a particular game, a query about how to deal with a problem you've encountered, a post about how you tried out Qin and this bit worked but that bit not so much, an actual play report, a post talking about how much fun your group has with Exalted and why you love the Charms mechanic, a post talking about a cul de sac you've hit in your campaign and asking for suggestions, tips for dealing with a dissatisfied player, a query as to what people get out of zero to hero play, a thread about how you added ninjae to your game but it didn't make it cooler and can anyone help you work out why.<br/><br/>All that is play focussed posting, none of it is consumption focussed.

Most RPGs are just the core book, not much in the way of supplements, and after a while, just playing with the corebook gets boring. When I think about the things I liked about AD&amp;D2e, one of them is the continually expanding options. Sure, with some systems all you need is the core book and you can make anything up, but supplements often come up with new ideas that take your game in directions you wouldn't have thought of before. I imagine for the most part, people will play a new game for a while, enjoy it to start with, and then after they've finished it, there isn't much reason to revisit it. I think DRYH would be a perfect example of this - once you've gone through it once, there's not going to be much interest in playing it again. Classroom Deathmatch would be the same. No real expansions for either of them (CD is an expansion for Panty Explosion, but I imagine that would wear out after a while, you look at the supplement and decide to do CD as an end to it). If you want people talking about playing more, you'd need to have systems that have greater longevity and better support. The Wizards boards get plenty of discussion about playing D&amp;D, SJG gets plenty about playing GURPS.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_194843">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194843/#Comment_194843" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-28T01:59:18+00:00" title="February 28, 2009  1:59AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We keep <a href="http://www.phreeow.net/wiki/tiki-index.php" rel="nofollow">fairly extensive AP material of various types</a>, from new game ideas to audio transcriptions from games to characters, worlds, and other creation processes/results.

Each forum poster would have links in their signature to the games they are currently playing.  Games you could read about, inspire yourself from and thereby not only improve your own game but also learn about what is out there in explicitly practical terms.  Online reviews are frequently useless as they are written by people who not only haven't actually played the games they write about, but might not play any games at all.<br/><br/><br/>In practical terms, I'd like to see if it isn't possible to create some central database for records of actual play.  A place where people could come and compare their different games and approaches and inspire themselves without fear of the focus shifting to selling new stuff or discussing stuff you've bought but not used.  I think the best thing that could happen for online gaming culture would be the creation of an actual play-focused community.<br/><br/>Technically I guess one could use a blog to tie all the different sites together...

Well, really it plots narratives from simple emotional transaction events labeled with short bits of user-provided flavor text.  Oh, I just found a <a href="http://www.computationalcreativity.com/rpyp/PaginaMEXICA/mexica.htm" rel="nofollow">website with two of its stories</a>.<br/><br/>Anyhow, one of the things it does internally is model all its narratives in an abstract form and stores them in a file.  Anytime a new narrative comes to an impasse, it automatically sorts through the file for previous characters who have been through a similar network of emotional transactions.  Also, it can judge the novelty of the current narrative based on that file and add something to shake things up if the narrative is getting too cliche.<br/><br/>I'm not sure exactly where I'm going with this  But it grabs at me that MEXICA's models are creatively useful for other users because the models are stored centrally and as abstract forms rather than as detailed artifacts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_195110">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195110/#Comment_195110" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-02T14:16:50+00:00" title="March  2, 2009  2:16PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            more money on the Love to tell but hate to listen argument please. <br/><br/>Honestly, I never understood the use of actual play outside of specific examples. Its hard to read, hard to format, hard to understand, your dealing with two currents of content (the game and the Game or rather the players and the their characters). You almost never have access to the other reports that may make actual play into something useful (AP full of onesided stories, and confusion experts baffled[the onion]  )<br/><br/>that said I would live to talk more about games and less about critique, models, actual play, indie personalities, and whatever wankery is actually happening here sometimes. <br/><br/>What I actually get is a lot of people telling me i'm either doing it wrong (definition discussions)  or that I'm not doing it right (forgish discussions, mostly because I couldn't be paid to give 2 figs about the forge ) or that its already been done and I should go read it after the fact (The forge!, sometimes blogos)<br/><br/>Oh well, Internet Beggers can't be Internet Choosers, but we can be Internet Bitchers<br/><br/>Logos                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_195275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195275/#Comment_195275" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-03T09:29:10+00:00" title="March  3, 2009  9:29AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>I keep wanting to write about how awesome my current Mouse Guard game is, but I never know where to start or what people want to hear about.</blockquote>\nCheck out the AP threads over at the BW boards.
