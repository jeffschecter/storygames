Rather than just describe changes, I'm going to start from the beginning, for the unfamiliar.<br/><br/>Contract Work is a game about debt so great that you must become a hitman to pay it off. A paid assassin. A hitter.<br/><br/>Money is the way everything is measured in the game so it is played with poker chips. There are no dice. The resolution of dicey-type situations is made by bidding amounts against each other and then dividing the money between your aggressive and defensive actions. Ideally, you get what you want from the other guy (like killing him) while covering your own ass.<br/><br/>Character statistics include Assets. These are the ways you work a job and are scaled from 1 to 10. They also limit/control the amounts of money you involve in the bidding situations. The other important stats are the Hitter's Value; what they are worth to their employers, and Debt; what lessens their worth. Value comes from the Hitter's Assets. Debt is gained as the Hitter makes mistakes on the job. Once Debt exceeds Value, the Hitter is worth more dead than alive, and is now a target. Target Hitters can't use any Asset they haven't "bought back" so a Hitter spends his career trying to earn enough money to survive the day he is targeted by the other assassins.<br/><br/>The game is structured to be told in flashback, like an interview. The Hitters explain how they killed the target and work backwards from there outlining the steps they took to that end. They then focus in one the steps and use them to recount and collect the preparations they will use against the target or recount an attempt on the Target's life. The outline is flexible. People being interviewed/interrogated lie or get confused. They just need to revise their story.<br/><br/>Pay and Target strength for the Jobs are created based on Hitter's Values. The reward money for the job is a bank at the center of the table. The GM (know as Interrogator since his primary goal is to ask the Hitters to lead the chain of events) draws from this cash, as do any Hitters who are still working under cover, keeping the Target unaware of their actions. The Hitters get money from the bank based on their Values. If this money is all lost, the Hitter is dead. The rest represents the Target's resilience. If it's gone the Target is dead and the Hitters can expect no reprisals.<br/><br/>Here are the current resolution mechanics:<br/>Hitter declares what he will do. Acquire a preparation that will be used against the target or attempt a Hit. In a Hit, only preparations the Hitter is already carrying will be bid, so preps need to be accumulated beforehand. The Hitter can call in other hitters as accomplices.<br/><br/>The Hitter makes an opening bid from one of three sources. From the bank if under cover, from his own cash if he's been found out, or from Preparations already in hand. An opening bid in cash is limited by the Hitter's Asset but a Prep can be bid in full to start. Hitter describes the actions opening the situation.<br/><br/>The Interrogator sees the bid and can raise by an Asset of the Target. This bet is the value of what the Hitter will gain from the wager; Prep or damage to the Target. Inter. describes the opposition.<br/><br/>The Hitter then adds in the Asset in cash. This is the Hitter's final bet. What the Asset is doing in the situation is narrated.<br/><br/>Both sides take their totals and, in secret, divide them between Attack and Defense. The numbers are then revealed and compared.<br/><br/>* If the Hitter's Attack &gt; Interrogator's defense, he gets what the Interrogator bid as a Prep or damage the Target.<br/>* If the Interrogator's Attack &gt; Hitter's defense, the Hitter loses his money from the wager (discarded from play.) Debt is raised by the amount lost. The Asset is lowered by the difference. If under cover, cover is blown.<br/>* Hitter's defense &gt; than Inter. attack, the amount the Hitter bid is returned to him as cash, a collected reward (reason to cover your ass while attacking.)<br/>* Inter. defense &gt; Hitter Attack, Inter. returns money to the bank.<br/>* Both sides successfully defend, the situation is prolonged. A new wager begins, piling on to the money already on the table.<br/><br/>Each side narrates their actions that directly caused the outcome.<br/><br/>Here's the wrinkle. The Hitter can make the Interr. reverse his A and D bids (A becomes D, vice versa) if he has a Risk token. Hitter's get Risk tokens by making situations harder. Risk tokens sit on amounts of cash in the bank. If Hitter or Inter. bids that chip, the Risk token comes with it and complicates the situation. These complications boost the Target's assets, make the Hitter gain Liabilities (anti-Assets,) or foreshadow a retaliation from the target. If the Hitter gains some cash from a situation that includes a Risk bid, he keeps that token until spent to make the Inter. flip. After it's spent, it goes back to the bank and is attached to another cash chip.<br/><br/>The Inter. starts similar wagers as retaliations. The Hitter can gain more reward money from these exchanges, if they aren't killed.<br/><br/>If the Target has been killed and there's still reward money in the bank, anyone can draw from it. Even Hitters whose cover was blown.<br/><br/>At the end of the job is the upkeep. Hitters have to pay to stay in fighting trim. $100 per point of asset. Anything more is added to their earnings for their career. Assets can be raised, and add to value. Here is where they buy back their Assets. It's expensive but a paid off Asset needs no upkeep cost in future. Unfortunately, paid assets reduce Hitter value as the employers have less control over their tools.<br/><br/>Lots to read, I know. I'm not sure if anyone who already played can see the changes, but trust me, they caused lots of frustration and self-castigation.<br/><br/>So, mathematicians, any glaring flaws in how the numbers work? Narrativists, any irksome details in game flow or character descriptions of action? Crunch-enthusiasts, too many rules? Too few? Feel free to tell me it sucks, 'cause I guarantee I've said it 10 times more than you to spur my revisions                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_132147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132147/#Comment_132147" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-03T14:21:42+00:00" title="March  3, 2008  2:21PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I read it now for the first time, and I'll like to see it play out before commenting.

Difference in the case of reducing Asset means the difference of the winner's Attack vs. the loser's Defense. Asset points in play are considered $100s.<br/><br/>I bet $1000, split $400 Attack / $600 Defense<br/><br/>I Defend $600, the other guy Attacks $800. My asset is reduced by 2. <br/><br/>The money is all or nothing though. I lost that $1K bet and took the damage to my Asset.<br/><br/>In play with chips, it reduces to 1s, 5s, and 10s, bringing it in line with the values of the Assets. Monopoly money was just suggested to me on my LJ as a good substitute for chips.<br/><br/>Pennys, nickels and dimes may be another option.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
