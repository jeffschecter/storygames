If you have a demo you'd like me to give, let me know where I can get it from (or send me a copy!).   Note that I can't guarantee that I'll actually do your demo on the day, or even that I've got a copy of your game!  However, I'll try my best. <br/><br/>Neil.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172261">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil" title="Neil"><img alt="Neil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil">Neil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172261/#Comment_172261" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-01T06:30:56+00:00" title="October  1, 2008  6:30AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Concrete Cow has been and gone.  Unfortunately for the demos, I was in longer games for most of the day; between that and general running around, I didn't get much chance to do demos.  I managed to run two in the end: one for Covenant and one for Thou Art But a Warrior.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Covenant demo took a while to get going.  The players didn't seem to get the idea of having to use narration to justify all the changing of dice: that could have been my poor explanation.  So the given scene went quickly and we improvised a follow-up.  That went better.  At the end of the scene, I said, "And that's the demo over.  Thanks,"  and there was a bit of disappointment in the players' faces.<br/>\n<br/>\nThou Art But A Warrior got off to a better start.  There were three players plus me, so I played the Infidel (a.k.a. Polaris's Mistake), one player was the Heart, and the other two were the Star and Moon (a.k.a. Moons) There was some initial bafflement about the key phrases, but that that soon passed.  During the demo, the Moon players got stuck into the narration and were bandying about 'But Only If's with the best of them.  I thought it wasn't really my place to tell them they were doing it wrong, as they having so much fun.  One of the players went off all enthused to convince his group at home to play Polaris.  I'm not sure whether he actually bought a copy of TABAW.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, a reasonably successful couple of demos.  I'll try to do the same thing at the next Concrete Cow, and reserve a bit more time for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks to everyone who offered demos for me to run.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
