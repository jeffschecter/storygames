During that time, I met someone that was talking about a failed venture to put together a shared story environment online. I thought that this was just about the best idea ever, but I didn't know how to approach it. I played in a couple games that kept this idea rolling in my head, namely a historical fiction in which Doc Holiday, Joan D'arc, Calamity Jane, Agrippa, and several other historical figures met on a spaceship. It was an amazing shared story experience that didn't really need any setup. There was only one combat for the whole game. (Credit goes to Ogremarco for GMing and having the idea). Later, when working on my National Novel Writing Month entry, I figured out where this was going. My Nano this year is a choose your own adventure RPG murder mystery. It's about the coolest thing I've ever written.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea: In the short term, I want to make choose your own adventure RPG novels with a story based system instead of a combat based system. In the novel I have now, the story plays ot a little based on the character stats, and a lot based on your accumulated influence with the other characters in the story. In the long term, I want to make an online RPG environment (possibly a MMO) based on this system. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe concept: Imagine, if you will, your standard dungeon crawl scenario. The wizard hires you and your party to go kill some dudes and make some cash. Now imagine that you've worked for this wizard before and you've accumulated influence with him- so much, in fact, that he gets drunk on elderberries and tells you how he's really the evil bad dude and spills his master plan. Now you have the choice to betray your party and join the big bad dude, or betray the big bad dude (and lose all influence with him that you've been working to build) or about 15 other things that I can't think up off the top of my head. This is a very simplified, highly unlikely version of the influence system, but it should give a basic idea of how it works.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe master plan: D&amp;D is betting that people will pay 10-15 dollars a month to have pretty animated minis and environments online to play games that they need to think up on their own. My idea is to expand on this and have all the books that get written playable, and the opportunity to create your own, and the opportunity to have interactive online shared story time. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe necessary explanation: Yes, NWN kind of thought of this first. Their modules are very similar to the concept I'm thinking of, but NWN is grounded in D&amp;D and no matter how much story you put in, it's still a combat based system. Everything eventually boils down to combat or social combat. The only MMO that I know of right now that has non-combat classes is Star Wars. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhere I need your help: I am neither a writer or a technical person. I do Nano because I find it to be a fun challenge. I'm a gamer and a reader and a real estate agent. It was only after talking to many people that all the holes in my first story got ironed out, and there's still some issues with play. Here's where you all come in. I want to gather writers, gamers, and techies together to hammer this out. I want to play through shared story environments and transcribe them. I want to get more of these books hammered out and bring back the choose your owns like I loved when I was a kid. I want an online shared story environment that has all the goodness of an MMO without all the combat.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, that's what I have as a real basic sketch. It's broad and nebulous and a lot of dreaming. I would appreciate any input or help tremendously. I will be setting up forums in the next couple days to help facilitate this, and will be trying to organize a get together to brainstorm and play in person. I will post as these things happen. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the mean time, I'll be writing like mad.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_109104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109104/#Comment_109104" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-21T05:03:52+00:00" title="November 21, 2007  5:03AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love the CYOA format, have written them in the past for my own amusement, and I think this idea could work quite well.  I'm not exactly sure what you are after here, either in the experience of play or the actual objects you'll be creating.  An example, maybe?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
