Here's where to go to get started.   Unfortunately, I threw myself headlong at a game idea that was fundamentally flawed, considering that I basically missed two of the pieces of art that were in one of the sets I chose, and spent a good day and a half designing around that flawed concept.<br/><br/>After recovering the shattered pieces of my sanity, I've thrown myself back into the fray and banged out this:<br/>Here's the quick pitch:<br/><br/>The game uses (primarily) Dale Horstman's art sets.  There are four players in the game, and it is set up much like Polaris in its rigor.<br/><br/>At the beginning of time, there were four Elemental Lords.  Seraph (Air) - the mermaid art, Ouros (Fire) - the serpent art, and Chthon (Earth) - the king figure.  Each of these Lords was in constant contention with their Nemesis, and this constant flux kept the universe in constant harmony, and prevented the World from being born.  But one of the Lords, now known as Leviathan (Water) - a black square, made a pact with his Nemesis in order to make the Cosmos in his own image.  Leviathan was consumed by the process and the Cosmos became unbalanced, resulting in the creation of the World.<br/><br/>The game plays out over the Four Ages of the World.  In each one, the Elemental Lords are trying to defeat the Leviathan and return the Cosmos to a balanced state.  Of course, in doing this, they destroy the world.  The Leviathan is seen by the people of the world as their protector - the world itself is mostly ocean, dotted with islands.<br/><br/>Mechanically, the game is set up like this:<br/><br/>There is a central board, with four stations around a central ring.  Each station belongs to one of the Elemental Lords, which are represented by the art in the set (plus the black image).  Each player chooses (or is given) one of the Elemental Lords to play.  Then each player is dealt a Nemesis (the other art piece for each character - the mermaid, the beast-man and the serpent-lady), including Leviathan.  <br/><br/>Finally, the players are all dealt a hand of playing cards to use as currency during the game - each suit belonging to one of the Lords - but the cards are dealt by rank (everyone is dealt an Ace, etc), and you may get a suit belonging to anyone.  You get the Jack, Queen and King of your own suit - these cards are different in that they represent divine intervention on the part of the Lord - a sort of ubertrump card.<br/><br/>There are other components - one based on Elizabeth Shoemaker's art (the hand photographs) - which are powers that you can execute once per Age of the world: lock, bind, sacrifice and void (again, a black square).<br/><br/>Play will be centered around the center circle, on which will be drawn a relationship map of the World - cities, religions, societies - that are created, manipulated and destroyed during the Age of the World in play.  This would borrow, to some extent, from REIGN's ORE system of agency creation.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>I can see the game table.  I can see people playing the game, and I can see the flow of play - what I'm missing, what I really need, is the theme of the game - what the driving force of the game is.  Is it about the status quo v. change?  Is it about the inside-out ethics (if the other Lords win, after all, the World is destroyed - usually a bad thing)?  It seems like I have all the brew I need to create some serious play - but I can't get it to come to a boil in my head.  I can't seem to get a real handle on what the game is about, which is stalling my ability to define the conflicts.<br/><br/>Any suggestions?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_140783">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140783/#Comment_140783" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-22T06:01:42+00:00" title="April 22, 2008  6:01AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's about balance.
