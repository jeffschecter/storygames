About fucking time.</li><li>The flavor is <i>designed</i>.  Setting and background act as a play support.  Art supports it too.</li><li>There's a willingness to let go of old tropes to make for a more coherent world.</li><li>Sexy. Dwarf. Ladies.</li><li>Sexy Tieflings. Both Ways.</li><li>Warlord - I've been waiting for this guy ever since... well... ever since I made a bard whose 'musical ability' was Battlefield Rhetoric</li><li>Form factor - they're going to a more magazine-style look and that's nicer for bringing with me on the train.  I have no need to say "Look at the mock-ancient tome I'm reading!  I'm reading something SPECIAL that's NOT FOR YOU!"</li><li>The game looks fucking FUN.</li></ul>\n<b>The Bad</b><ul><li>GSL Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt.  Get the other companies on board, or shut them out, but conflicting messages make baby Jesus cry.  </li><li>Mark my words, the online tabletop / environment / gleemax will suck.  They were destined to suck.  They suck now in preview.  They will continue to suck.  SUCK.  Wizards bit off more than they can chew and they're trying to pretend that everything's fine with project manager jargon.  I don't care how good 4e is, a rising tide raises all boats unless they have giant sucking wounds where their hulls should be.</li><li>Killing Dragon and Dungeon at the top of their game in advance of the new addition?  <i>Dumb.</i></li><li>Art for the dragonborn is really, really disappointing.  This looks like what you get when you scrap too many designs: "Don't make it look like a particular kind of dragon..."   "Don't make it look like a draconian from Dragonlance..."  "Don't make it look too humanoid..."  This is even more tragic because I think the niche they fill - honorable, dragon-kin warriors - is excellent and has excellent flavor text.</li><li>Ability scores, then ability modifiers.  Yes, it irks me.  Yes, the fact that it irks me tells you a lot about my personality.</li><li>Lame names, and I'd bet some good names were killed by google searches.</li><li>Despite the revamping and ditching of the old form-filling symmetries (plane of ooze... plane of ash...) I still get a sense of form-filling writing, That's sad to see but it's not going to sink the game.</li></ul>\n<b>The Inevitable</b><ul><li>I am a consumer whore.</li><li>The game still has lots of rules.</li></ul>\n<b>The Still-Unanswered Question</b><ul><li>How much work do I need to put in to enjoy running this game?</li></ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141022">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141022/#Comment_141022" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-24T00:25:29+00:00" title="April 24, 2008 12:25AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">ever since I made a bard whose 'musical ability' was Battlefield Rhetoric</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nI can only say... <i>awesome</i>!!!1!1ONE <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>\n<br/>\nAbout the dragonborn: you confirm my impression from the PHB cover... fugly art, with a look that resembles a deformed crocodile with a bad skin disease :-/                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141023">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Millsy" title="Millsy"><img alt="Millsy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Millsy">Millsy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141023/#Comment_141023" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-24T00:27:21+00:00" title="April 24, 2008 12:27AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've resisted getting any of the preview materials, because I figured I was always going to buy 4th Ed., but I guess I'm looking forward to it.

At the same time, the game I'd actually be playing looks awesome.<br><br>Some more thoughts as of 4 AM:<br><br/><b>What I think I have to do</b>\n<ul><li>I need to make a new setting for my game.  One option is 'fantasy's greatest hits' where I use the massive stack of material I own, but I've never actually gotten a game like this off the ground because I make it into something cool and then feel like it's not really mine.  The other option is something new and original... which is of course a stratospheric amount of work for me (and work for the players too, since they can't fall back on their knowledge of D&amp;D settings).</li><li>I need to find a way to let the players explore and see more of the world, because I want to show them the cool stuff I made for them.</li><li><b>Biggest hurdle:</b> I don't want to write sessions.  I'm really good at it, I can do it quickly, and I can reel players into it like I was born to it, but it's exhausting and it usually means my games get put off for ages until I have the energy to prepare them.  So I need to find a way to structure my game and be ready for a session without getting inside my players' heads, figuring out their characters, and writing the session where they fall into their roles in my story.</li><li>I need to pick a level range I'm going to work with.  Originally I thought 1-10 would be "the new E6" but I am seriously thinking about level 20, since craziness has been pushed more towards level 30.  I have to see the rules first, but I don't like Raise Dead or Teleport.</li><li>Taking out alignment looks like it will be easy enough.</li><li>Stop being a whiner about the dice.  I've been using GM rolls all the dice because I've been lazy and concentrating on taking over airspace from the big chair at the end of the table.</li></ul> </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141025">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141025/#Comment_141025" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-24T01:30:09+00:00" title="April 24, 2008  1:30AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 24, 2008 1:34AM by John_Harper.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ye gods, the art.

It enhances he appeal of DDI and increases revenue, thereby making them look better to Hasbro, i.e., so they don't get sold off.<br/><br/>"How much work do I need to put in to enjoy running this game?"<br/><br/>If it's anything like the move from SWRCR - &gt; SWSE, your workload will decrease quite a bit. SWSE is a breeze to run, relatively speaking. That said, D&amp;D was elements (spells, exploits, magic items) that add a layer of complication not present in SWSE, but this has always been true of D&amp;D vs. other d20 RPGs.<br/><br/>As for the art, I've liked what I've seen so far. There are pics of the physical books on the ENWorld home page today, and they look pretty tasty.<br/><br/>Regardless, I'm psyched, but reserve final judgement until I get the actual product.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141060">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20K" title="John K"><img alt="John K" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20K">John K</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141060/#Comment_141060" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-24T07:58:30+00:00" title="April 24, 2008  7:58AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Linnaeus</cite><br/>Also, at first level in 4e, you add the CON stat, not the modifier, to your hit point total.</blockquote>\nIt's a lot of space in the rules/sheet to take up just because about 50% of character get an extra 1 Hp.<br/><br/>Overall though, I've been very impressed with what I've read about 4e.

To steal from Savage Worlds, hopefuly it's "fast, fun and furious D&amp;D".<br/><br/>I can empthasize with some of Ryan's concerns (I too prefer systems where the stat is the modifier or the dice pool, the stat is what you use, not something you derive what you use from, since they are 'cleaner' and move more to 'everything is on the character sheet').  D&amp;D online experience doesn't concern me that much (heck the less it has to offer the better grounds I have to ban laptops from the game, I like my tabletop pen and paper).  Artwork, well as much as it does help get sense of syle etc. I've always taken or left artwork.  I liked Planescape but could never take its artwork seriously, for example.<br/><br/>It's still a very "physics engine" game (to steal a term) and table-style or hacked rules will have to add roleplaying, story etc. to it and decide between railroad or sandbox.<br/><br/>That said, I anticipate running a campaign only in level 1-10 (heroic).  I've never liked the over-buffed/high fantasy/flying etc. teleporting/raising dead all the time aspect of D&amp;D as it takes things far away from the literary/fiction roots I like.  So far everything described about 1-10 is "right on" with me (raising rare, you travel by horseback etc.).<br/><br/>I've always reworked religion and cosmology in every game I've run (the old D&amp;D cosmology was always offputting to me) and likely will again.  Though ironically some of their revisions are very close to things I have in my campaign that "drifting the two" together will work just fine. <br/><br/>In terms of campaign, my group plans to move forward several decades, 2 rounds in a world war, and some magical catastrophes between 3.5 and 4e, and then to run a campaign more focused in a very particular region of the world.  So the ability to sort content to what 4e supports for that region (e.g., all the gnomes are off-stage it seems) will be okay.<br/><br/>Our group has been using universalis tenets to establish our next campaign and after the last one being voyage of exploration, explore the world, into the jungle etc., the next one is intended to be more "focused" with it being deepening roots, understanding power plays, delving into past of this region, dealing with threats to this region.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141087">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

Using both gives the advantage of having to related by numerically different values based on the same concept. So, by way of completely made up example, you could have the paladin's smite ability give a bonus to hit equal to his Wisdom modifier and a bonus to damage equal to his Wisdom score.

I'd love to see what they end up doing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141212">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141212/#Comment_141212" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-24T21:48:54+00:00" title="April 24, 2008  9:48PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 24, 2008 10:41PM by Callan_S.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>A mutant armadillo man and exotic dancer pose for a portrait while rubbing their asses together?</blockquote>\nTogether, <i>they fight crime!</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141285">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeph" title="Jeph"><img alt="Jeph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/396/nMA3E0EWQEIUQ.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeph">Jeph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141285/#Comment_141285" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-25T10:27:22+00:00" title="April 25, 2008 10:27AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 25, 2008 10:27AM by Jeph.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt Sheridan</cite><br/>Ouch.  Yeah, not the biggest shock ever, but<i>ouch</i>.  I am now anticipating a "get X total successes, as a party, on various social and socially-applicable skill rolls in order to convince the Baron to fund your expedition" deal, instead of the<i>Burning Wheel</i>-esque social combat system that I was hoping for.</blockquote>\nFrom what I've seen of the previews and information coming out from demo games, that's pretty much exactly what the skill challenge system amounts to. The GM sets three target DCs, one for easy checks, one for medium, and one for hard. Players take turn making skill checks, using whatever skill they can fit to the situation in their description. There's a threshold of total successes for victory and total failures for defeat. In addition to counting against one threshold or the other, failing an easy check carries some extra penalty, and passing a hard check carries an extra bonus (+2 to your next check? Second chance to score another success?).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
