I did take a look at the article, and I've got a few thoughts on my own experience(s) with the present tense and stuff.<br/><br/>Novels:<br/>When I read Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson (a long time ago), it felt very speedy, very fast. That's when I really noticed it's written in the present tense. Obviously, there's more to it than just the tense, but that's what I noticed. Maybe he just does it well? (or is that a debate about cyberpunk literature? I'm not up for that...)<br/><br/>Not to say past-tense can't be speedy, though - I point to American Tabloid and The Cold Six Thousand by James Ellroy as proof.<br/><br/>The Elegant Variation (see link above):<br/>So Henkin sees writers ("graduate applications" - oh, yay! /sarcasm) use present tense as a crutch when nothing happens. Yeah, I could see that happening. Something to note, I suppose (I'd rather not dwell on the bad writers...)<br/><br/><br/>I disagree with Henkin that the present tense works better with a shorter narrative and a shorter time span. Don't think I have and back-up for that just now, though.<br/><br/>Present tense definitely <i>feels</i> more short-term, I think. Not to say that it doesn't work in a longer novel (it does), since a novel is made up of smaller pieces. But more when you are writing about a long, long stretch of time. Is present tense more action-oriented then? (There's also a difference between "She goes to the store" and "She is going to the store.")<br/><br/>Making the "leaps of time necessary in fiction" is actually pretty easy - using the screenplay solution, for one. Or is that maybe a cue for Christopher to expand on Dramatic Narration for RPGs? I'm interested.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174518">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174518/#Comment_174518" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-10T16:26:45+00:00" title="October 10, 2008  4:26PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Writing about writing:<br/><br/>When I write about a piece of literature, either a document analysis, or literary criticism, I write about the stuff that happens in the work in the present tense.

The term comes from a Greek word meaning "action" (Classical Greek: \u03b4\u03c1\u03ac\u03bc\u03b1, dr\xe1ma), which is derived from <i>"to do"</i> (Classical Greek: \u03b4\u03c1\u03ac\u03c9, dr\xe1\u014d). <br/><br/>So, Narrative told through the form of Drama is called Dramatic Narrative and is a told told through the actions of the characters ("to do").  <br/><br/>Plain ol' vanilla Narrative is the "recounting" of a tale, and is told via prose or poetry. The characters definitely <i>do</i> things.  But the narrative isn't revealed through the actions of the characters (which in a play or movie is really what we're watching), but in the telling of the tale (through words).  One is bodies in motion (whether through tongues wagging or deed done) as revealed, right before us, as members of an audience watching characters in action.  The other is a tale told to us, through a storyteller of one type or another.<br/><br/>Screenplays and plays are written in the present tense.  <br/><br/>Here's a scene from the Walter Hill draft of ALIEN:<br/><br/><span style="font-family: Courier;">INT. HYPERSLEEP VAULT<br/><br/>Explosion of escaping gas.<br/>The lid on a freezer pops open.<br/>Slowly, groggily, KANE sits up.<br/>Pale.<br/>Kane rubs the sleep from his eyes.<br/>Stands.<br/>Looks around.<br/>Stretches.<br/>Looks at the other freezer compartments.<br/>Scratches.<br/>Moves off.</span><br/><br/>I'm not sure where to take this in terms of RPGs.  Someone has already mentioned <i>Polaris</i> as an example of a game that uses past tense with his terrific verbal negotiation mechanic.  And now what?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174648">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F" title="Alex F"><img alt="Alex F" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/746/n1IV3AA06DPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F">Alex F</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174648/#Comment_174648" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-12T08:52:28+00:00" title="October 12, 2008  8:52AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 12, 2008 2:46PM by Alex F.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a good conversation, I actually think there could be lots to talk about here.<br/><br/>One thing the article homed in on was the difficulties of elapsing time in the present tense. The implication was that in written fiction it's easier to move from a protagonist's boyhood to their first job, to their first marriage, to their outburst at the retirement party. The present tense, due to its immediacy, can make the same journey feel choppy and dizzying.<br/><br/>If rpgs are close enough kin to dramatic narrative - and I agree with Christopher that they are - this seems to matter less. We can just do what all movies and tv shows do - cut to a black screen with the words "6 months later" and then take it from there, right? However, I think that dramatic narrative has an invaluable resource that it uses to cushion the impact of a cut-forward in time: the visual arena.<br/><br/>I watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0411270/" rel="nofollow">The Beat That My Heat Skipped</a> this weekend (see it, it's excellent), and there is a cut-forward toward the end of the movie. It even says "2 years later". In the very next scene, we see the protagonist in an environment which has not been presented in the narrative before, painted from a very different palette and instilling a feeling that something has progressed. The protagonist is dressed somewhat differently, and has a different haircut. Thus, even before we are directly informed that the situation has changed, we've bought into the idea that events have moved forward temporally. <br/><br/>Now, often in dramatic narrative, we skip forward to serve the 'external plot', rather than substantial character change - e.g., the final turn has to happen after the election, during the State of the Union address. I believe that creators are still communicating progress through visual cues: he's shaved his moustache, her desk is in a different place, the weather is different. It may be subtle, but I believe it's there, even if we cut back to the same old familiar detective's back office. When it's not there, the fiction feels a little creaky to me, a bit less believable.<br/><br/>My contention is that if we rely on the "6 months later" type approach - that is, agreeing out of the fiction that the fiction has moved forward - we risk not persuading ourself that time really has elapsed. We say "six months later" but we feel "one scene later". <br/><br/>If you feel the same way as me about this, what can you do about it? I've got a couple of thoughts:<br/><br/><b>Reincorporate, with a twist:</b><br/>If your breather/reflection scenes have taken place in a kebab house called Mikos Grill, open up the scene on the familiar sign,  and then narrate it being yanked away and replaced by a Kinko's sign. Then pan across to the characters in the Starbucks two shops down.<br/><br/><b>Invoke contrasts:</b><br/>If your story has taken place thus far in the muted ochres and grey's of the east-side tenements, with characters grimy from their undercover work, kick-off in a shimmering room housing a grand swimming pool, casting blue and white around you.<br/><br/>I'd like to hear more - refinements on these, or other thoughts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
