Right now, I'm treating this statement as a given, and I'm not terribly interested in debating it in this thread.<br/><br/>To split hairs: by 'make characters' I mean 'assign player resources to elements of the fiction', and by 'create adversity' I mean 'assign counter-player resources to elements of the fiction,' and by 'create situation' I mean 'create fictional elements ripe for conflict.'<br/><br/>You can create these essential ingredients in any order (I think).  You can create any or all of them before or during actual roleplay.<br/><br/>For instances:\n<ul><li>In your assumed-standard dungeoncrawl out of a adventure supplement, the situation (dungeon) is created first, then gets adversity resources assigned, and then (without referencing either situation or adversity) the player characters are created.</li>\n<li>In a long-term homebrew campaign, the first situation and adversity may be created before the characters, but at some point the later situations and adversities are created with existing characters already made (and having been played through the first few situations).</li>\n<li><em>In a Wicked Age</em> creates situation first, then makes player characters out of people in the situation, and sets the player characters against each other to provide adversity.</li>\n<li>In <em>Full Light, Full Steam</em>, you make PCs first, then situation, then stat up the situation to provide adversity.</li>\n<li>Using Palladium's <em>Villains Unlimited</em>, you might pick out a supervillain (adversity), figure out an evil plot for him to enact (situation), and then have the players create superheroes to fit.</li>\n<li>In <em>Capes</em>, you make PCs and Adversity first, then start roleplaying, <em>then</em> create the situation (although prep helps create good situations).</li></ul>\nNow, I think all of these are certainly <em>valid</em>.  I do suspect, however, that there are different advantages to be reaped by doing things in different orders.  Like, in <em>IAWA</em>, you always get character deeply embedded in the situation.  Or in <em>FLFS</em>, the situation is always based off of what the players have flagged as interesting in their PCs.  There are a lot of variables, though, and a lot of different orders to do things in, and I'm positive I can't track them all myself.  So I turn to you, Story-Gamesians: what have your experiences been with different setups, what have you enjoyed with them, what hangups have you discovered?<br/><br/>Also, I'm kind of shaky on adversity-first set-up: what's the advantage in that, ever?<br/><br/>And math-folk: how many different ways are there to order four elements (Sitch, PC, Adversity, Start Roleplaying)?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_82393">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82393/#Comment_82393" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-19T19:53:39+00:00" title="July 19, 2007  7:53PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is cool.<br/><br/>There are 24 ways to arrange them.<br/><br/>In my campaign design I tend to bounce around among the three elements a lot before the start.

Thanks for spelling this stuff out explicitly. It'd be interesting to see some more games that go in order of: Start Roleplaying, Adversity, Sitch, PC \xe2\u20ac\u201d if that were even possible. <br/><br/>What's interesting about adversity-first is that it follows an old-school superhero introduction format.\n<blockquote>Scene: In 1920s New York, a leggy broad takes a shortcut through an alleyway lit only by a flickering street light. Suddenly a goon appears, brandishing a pocket knife!<br/><br/>Goon: Gimme yer money!<br/>Woman: Just take it! (She throws down her purse.)<br/>Goon (Smiling): Now how about a little kiss?<br/>Woman: Help! Won't somebody save me?<br/><br/>Suddenly a caped silhouette rises in front of the street light. The goon turns to look towards it, but is blinded by the gleam.<br/><br/>Silhouette: You shouldn't play with knives, young man.<br/>Goon: Who the heck are you, buddy?<br/>Silhouette: I am the darkness of night. I am the eternal shadow. I am... THE ECLIPSE!<br/><br/>The caped figure jumps onto the goon's back and pulls him into the shadows. A few grunts and screams echo around the alley's walls until finally the Eclipse emerges, carrying the woman's purse.</blockquote>\nSo that's one way of introducing sitch and adversity first, then roleplaying, then creating a PC, I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_82473">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82473/#Comment_82473" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-20T09:02:29+00:00" title="July 20, 2007  9:02AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Neat, Daniel.

Adversity is a third step, after the players pick (and stat up, to whatever degree) their characters, when the GM or opposing player invests the conflict with resources.  So, that nitpick aside, yeah, I like this sort of set-up, because it makes the PCs and the adversity significantly enmeshed in the situation, and makes the conflicts immediate and visceral.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_82490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anemone" title="Anemone"><img alt="Anemone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.tlucretius.net/temp/anemone_icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anemone">Anemone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82490/#Comment_82490" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-20T11:22:59+00:00" title="July 20, 2007 11:22AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>I'm kind of shaky on adversity-first set-up: what's the advantage in that, ever?</blockquote>\nStructuring your thoughts, picking the type of challenge you'll be answering, setting the tone of the game.  For example, in Johnzo's <i>Exodus II</i> game, the group brainstormed the creation of the entire set, plot and characters as part of the first episode.  Aside from agreeing to play "sci-fi writ large", I think the first thing we came up with was the central, overarching challenge: a partially built multi-generational colony ship, an Earth that just went through the Big Collapse, and the decision of whether to stay (and help Earth) or go (and fulfill the mission).  This, of course, also created large chunks of setting, but this setting was built around the challenge.<br/><br/>Other examples are games where we (my group) decide whether we want to play a story of heroic rescue, or gritty survival, or of suspenseful race against the clock.  I submit that <i>Wilderness of Mirrors</i> is a game where the challenge is picked first.  At least, when I ran it I stated what the mission objective was and the players' take on this then guided the character creation, then the setting/mission creation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_82493">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82493/#Comment_82493" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-20T11:53:45+00:00" title="July 20, 2007 11:53AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, adversity first can allow you to explore an issue or theme in a very focused way.

However, the specific plotlines and opposition are created later.  For example, in my current Dragons of the Yellow Sea game, we first decided on the rough time and place:  Jeju-do in 1862 of the parallel history, and we knew that the characters would become involved in peasant uprisings.  However, I had no plan about the specific adversity until after characters were created.  <br/><br/>The same has generally applied to superheroic games like Champions and Buffy -- the PCs are created first and then appropriate villains put up against them (including their enemies as defined by the players during character creation).  <br/><br/>Still, there are times when I create adversity first.  My Life With Master pretty much requires this -- you starts with adversity and to a large degree situation.  There's a lot of situation built into the game setup after you have a Master.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_82519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82519/#Comment_82519" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-20T15:33:06+00:00" title="July 20, 2007  3:33PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Continuing to toy with ideas, here:<br/><br/>Situations that are informed by already-made PCs can make use of player flags, resulting in a situation tailored to player interests.<br/><br/>Situations that are informed by already-allocated Adversity can be of appropriate scale: I can remember running a lot of games where the resources I assigned to my NPCs were either way too much or way too little to pull off the situation those NPCs were supposed to be in.<br/><br/>Situations that arise through play may feel more natural, or give players a greater sense of ownership since they made it together, through play.<br/><br/>PCs that are informed by an already-created situation can be embedded in that situation, allowing you to play from within a conflicted situation, rather than coming in from outside.<br/><br/>PCs that are informed by already-allocated Adversity can stack up appropriately, determining how hard the following play will be.<br/><br/>PCs that are created through play will have more appropriate abilities (well, I just happen to be a mechanic...) and probably attach themselves to the situation pretty thoroughly.<br/><br/>Adversity that is informed by an already-created situation can embed the adversity in the situation.

Perhaps something more codified, but in essence: "This situation will involve: an assassinated monarch, the wrong man framed for that murder, romance that turns into betrayal, an underground resistance movement and Da Vinci-esque clockwork mecha."  Then the players decide which parts of the sitch hook them in.  As a side effect, if no one chooses "an underground resistance movement", then the GM knows to not force it into the game -- maybe add it, but not as heavy as before.<br/><br/>Right now my group's playing in a Spirit of the Century campaign where the GM came up with adversity &amp; situation in advance -- that's this GM's style.  He read off the adversity, and I treated it like a GM flag to me: "Make this important to your character."  So, Baron Doom kidnapped my parents in Phase 1 of character creation and The Serpent King brainwashed my father into trying to kill me, leading me to have to kill him in Phase 5.  While SotC is all about the high-flying PC-first action, with the right group (or perhaps just the right frontloading), you can turn the concept of flags around and make it work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_82601">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82601/#Comment_82601" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-22T09:30:42+00:00" title="July 22, 2007  9:30AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Huh, situation-based flags.

What do ya'll groove on?"  And I wouldn't see it as a replacement for player flags, just a step before players are made.<br/><br/>But there's nothing in the idea inherently that says it has to go one way or the other.  You could also get together for campaign creation and come up with these as a group.  In the epic fantasy heartbreaker I've been noodling over using SotC character generation, each phase is fleshed out because it's character gen, campaign gem &amp; world gen all at once.  The very last phase asks "What quest is left unfinished?" (with some follow-ups, wheres and whos) -- players very clearly defining sitch in chargen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_82667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82667/#Comment_82667" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-23T08:42:45+00:00" title="July 23, 2007  8:42AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Adversity first can be useful in a Gamist context.

That is, often a player will, in fact, define their character by some central adversity. Creating that adversity in his mind, first. "Hmm, I want somebody who's fighting off an orc invasion. But, let's not make them a warrior. In fact that's his problem, he's weak, unable to fight. But he has this gift of sight that allows him to see when bad things are happening. But nobody listens to him."<br/>\n<br/>\nNote how in the example, the player starts with a central conflict from which to define his character, but then moves the specific conflict to something more personal to the character. It's no longer about the war, but about him not having a voice, though something important to say.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, generally, yeah, what Ryan said. Note that Chris Chinn, who came up with Flags, typically does "Central Conflict" as his method of choice for game set up (See his work on developing the scenario "the Well of Souls" with Peter Nordstrand at the Forge). That is, players or the GM come up with a central conflict, and then the players create flag-bearing characters that are inspired by the central conflict. Note that often, at this point, the central conflict ceases to be central to the plot - often relegated to the backdrop. It serves at that point mostly as metaplot that exists solely to cause the stories of the players to intertwine. So you don't end up with five non-connected stories.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally I find it enabling to have some such thing to work off of in character creation. It's only stifling if the GM assumes that I have to create a character meant to address the central conflict directly.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote, too, that what Tony hit on above - R-maps created with conflict where you then select the character off the map - that's Alyria, created several years ago by Seth Ben-Ezra.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_82724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82724/#Comment_82724" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-23T13:22:06+00:00" title="July 23, 2007  1:22PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joe, when I refer to creating PCs and Adversity in this thread, I'm talking about <em>assigning dice*</em> to fictional stuff, not coming up with the fictional stuff in the first place.

Statting up a situation I can imagine, thinking to Burning Empires.  Maybe that's adversity, or both at the same time?  But I want more examples.

Obviously, you can't assign dice before you have a character concept, so if you haven't got a concept yet, "creating a character'" entails finding and selecting a concept.  But I think it's foolish for any game to try and tell you not to think about your character until Step X.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_82938">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82938/#Comment_82938" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-24T09:33:47+00:00" title="July 24, 2007  9:33AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>Obviously, you can't assign dice before you have a character concept</blockquote>\nYou're so tempting me to make a game that breaks this assumption.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_82942">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester" title="Judson_Lester"><img alt="Judson_Lester" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://judsonlester.info/initials.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester">Judson_Lester</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82942/#Comment_82942" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-24T10:04:41+00:00" title="July 24, 2007 10:04AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's another fish for your kettle: it seems like ordering four (or even three) events is an over-simplification.  It seems more than reasonable that situation creation could start before PCs are created, and end after.  Even reducing "create PCs" to the process of assigning dice, you might assign some dice, create the situation, start roleplaying, and then finish PCs.  Especially so if you conflate "create PCs" and "create adversity."  <br/><br/>So, I'd suggest that you have, in fact, seven events to order: the starts and ends of creating situation, adversity and PCs, and the start of roleplaying - since the game that goes "start RP, end RP, create characters ..." seems a little odd.<br/><br/>I count 630 permutations thereof, accounting for the fact that the end of a process can't come before it's start.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_82945">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82945/#Comment_82945" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-24T10:20:13+00:00" title="July 24, 2007 10:20AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Additionally, Judson, there's a difference between creating characters after the situation has been created but without reference to that situation and creating characters drawn from the situation.

There's a bit of frontloading: a statement that echoes through one player's mind (who otherwise remembers nothing), and two items that keep appearing that'll feel familiar to said player.  After that, role-playing starts, though with constraints -- each person has a hand of cards that determines where scenes will take place, what characters the other players will play, what tonal elements will be featured later and who wins in conflicts.<br/><br/>Paul Tevis' "A Penny for my Thoughts," which will also be at the Ashcan Front, is similar in how soon you get to "start role-playing" and how little you define beforehand.<br/><br/>Edit: Though, perhaps sitch is defined by the game, since in both games the sitch is that you have no memories -- in mine, you're floating around in a fever dream-like space fighting against your subconscious, and in Paul's your patients trying to help each other regain their memories.  So perhaps these aren't as useful as examples of "start with role-play," even though sitch isn't decided.<br/><br/>Though, Robin Laws' "Yes but...the scenario" does strike me as "start with role-play."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_82954">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82954/#Comment_82954" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-24T10:51:09+00:00" title="July 24, 2007 10:51AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judson Lester</cite>Sure, but you can arbitrarily sort concurrencies and treat them equivalently to dependent systems - unless you get something out of separately counting concurrent systems as well.</blockquote>\nI can easily envision a multi-step character generation that spit out data in each step that was used in a multi-step situation creation procedure that itself spit out data in each step that was used in character generation.

You in no way touch the actual situation.  We don't know the situation surrounding whether or not I save my family from Uncle Vito, but only the before and a potential after.<br/><br/>But this could be a micro-situation inside of the larger situation (and perhaps "game axiom situation") of "You're a dude without memories and with some critical event that caused this," so it's still situation-before-play, even though we don't define the micro-situation specifics or play it out until the very end.<br/><br/>But I disgress.  Is this what you're looking at as "situation development?"  I can see that.  As far as your other comments, there may also be a further difference: "alter" versus "add to".  Perhaps in addressing the situation, we alter it, but development is merely adding to it.  If the situation is to commit an incoming coup, perhaps my convincing the princess to help our cause is "addressing," by altering her role in the situation.  And perhaps declaring that I know some disgruntled militia men is "developing," because it adds to the situation without changing it.  Naturally (and to further complicate this), development &amp; address can happen at the same time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_83045">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83045/#Comment_83045" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-24T14:44:57+00:00" title="July 24, 2007  2:44PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Macklin</cite>Perhaps in addressing the situation, we alter it, but development is merely adding to it.</blockquote>\nRyan, that may be a very big insight.

The situation in and of itself is not regularly lauded for being thematically powerful while the standard of success in play is often assumed to be thematically powerful address of the situation.  From my angle, the situation is only counted as valuable insomuch as it later provides opportunities for addresses of thematic value.<br/><br/>For instance: most folks will tell you that Luke's con scenarios "The Sword" and "The Gift" are well-crafted because they result in awesome play.  Nobody reviews "The Sword" and talks about the thematic value of the situation itself: "Man, the dwarf is a great expression of entitlement."  But that's something that is said about <em>play</em> of that scenario all the time.<br/><br/>At least, that's the view from my corner. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jbuchert" title="jbuchert"><img alt="jbuchert" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jbuchert">jbuchert</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83130/#Comment_83130" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-25T06:09:03+00:00" title="July 25, 2007  6:09AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 25, 2007 6:30AM by jbuchert.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Macklin</cite><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>With a situation built off of flags identified by all the players, yes?

We, as players, tend to have a more intimate relationship with our characters than with other elements of the game.  Are they giving game resources to the players?  Sure.  Are they giving the same game resources?  Maybe.  Is there anything more that one side if giving that they other isn't?  Most likely.<br/><br/>Some of this may be due to our "traditional RPG" roots, and I think some is rooted in the nature of playing a role -- you want to have as fleshed out a role as possible (whether that 'fleshed out' involves game resources or intangible personality effects).  Playing our role is one-step removed from being ourselves, as PC-players.  When our role interacts with other fiction elements in the game, that's two steps away:<br/>"I am playing a dude." [First level intimacy] + "My dude is in your base." [Second level intimacy] = "I am playing a dude who is in your base." [Both levels]<br/><br/>But I will be first to admit that this feels a little crackpotish.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
