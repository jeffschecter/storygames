By the time I got to the convention, I knew three things about it.  1) It had a really cool name.  2) Jackson designed it and he\u2019s a pretty interesting guy.  3) It had something to do with \u201creliving angst-filled moments.\u201d<br/><br/>Anyway, when I first saw Jackson, I told him I was interested in trying out the game.  He kind of gave me a \u2018WTF\u2019 look, but said in effect, sure, come up and ask me about it sometime during the convention.  So when I got back to the convention site on Saturday afternoon, I asked him if he was interested in running it in that second Saturday afternoon slot for me.  He was still unsure, telling me that he didn\u2019t think it was that good and that he had more or less given up on it and that he wasn\u2019t sure I had the right impression about the game, etc, but after reading the rules he gave me, I was still insistent.  So, after recruiting a second player, a really cool guy named Daniel, we found a spot on the couch in the hallway and threw down.<br/><br/>So the game is a 2 player game that revolves around the history of a relationship.  You have 10 scenes, all of which either take place along a timeline or branch off into alternate timelines.  It\u2019s a bit hard to explain via text, but if you look at my scene diagram and read the rest of the report, it should be clear.  There is one other constraint, which is also very interesting: You can only have four lines of dialogue, two for each person.  Everything else is physical description, which is why I dubbed it as Michaelangelo Antonioni: the RPG, after the Italian art house director famous for his use of long takes and minimal dialogue.<br/><br/>It was a fantastic game, the best I\u2019ve ever played in my admittedly short role-playing career, and I hope that Jackson will make it available to others.  No pressure, though, Jackson.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  Anyway, while Jackson was facilitating the game, he took some notes, which he was kind enough to give me for this report.  Some of the scene notes are more detailed than others, as his wrist gave out in certain places, so some of the scenes in this report will be more detailed than others, but I will also try to fill in spots with what I remember as best I can.  If I get something wrong or miss something important, please correct me.<br/><br/>So on to the game.  We did the opening set-up and came up with this:<br/><br/>Relationship Word: Father-son<br/>When It Takes Place: Modern day, our world<br/>2 Words for Relationship<br/>-\tStrained<br/>-\tMoney<br/>2 Words for Father<br/>-\tDisappointed<br/>-\tAcademic<br/>2 Words for Son<br/>-\tRebellious<br/>-\tLazy<br/><br/>During the course of the game, we also gave the son a name, Brian.  We never named the father.  (Maybe we should have for the purposes of this report, as it got awkward typing \u2018Brian\u2019s father\u2019 over and over again, but game-wise, I kind of like the fact that he was never named.)  We also established that Brian had a sister named Catherine.  The mother, however, was also never named.<br/><br/>[Here\u2019s my attempt at reconstructing our scene diagram.  If you find yourself losing track of when things took place while reading the report, refer back to this and hopefully it should help you out.]<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://pics.livejournal.com/rightrightleft/pic/0000283e"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_217613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EpsilonMinus" title="EpsilonMinus"><img alt="EpsilonMinus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EpsilonMinus">EpsilonMinus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217613/#Comment_217613" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-09T23:13:40+00:00" title="July  9, 2009 11:13PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Scene One<br/>Our first scene took place during a family vacation.  In this scene, the family was on the road in Indiana, en route to the Grand Canyon.  Basically, it is the ass-end of nowhere, nothing but burnt grass and cornfields, no scenery, really hot because it\u2019s the middle of summer, etc.  They\u2019re driving in one of those hideous 70\u2019s era station wagons with the wood paneling.  <br/><br/>Brian begins by saying, \u201cI\u2019m bored.  When are we gonna get there?\u201d  Meanwhile, the mother fans herself with a fashion magazine while Brian\u2019s father has sweat dripping down his face.  The sound of the bumps on the road penetrates the silence.  Then, Brian begins kicking the back of his father\u2019s chair, trying to get a response.  There is also the faint sound of the music coming out of the headphones of the sister\u2019s Walkman.  Brian\u2019s father is wearing a tweed blazer and there is the audible sound of the wipers scraping the windshield because the car is out of fluid.  Finally, Brian\u2019s father tells him, \u201cOnly boring people are bored.\u201d  <br/><br/>Brian then bellows, \u201cWell, I guess everyone in this car is really fucking boring then, Dad!\u201d  Brian\u2019s father then wipes the sweat off his brow while his mother looks into the back seat with her mouth agape.  The music from the headphones becomes louder as the sister slides her headphones off.  However, she looks bored, as if she has seen this all before.  Then, Brian\u2019s father turns around to join his wife in giving Brian \u2018the look.\u2019  However, as he does this, he doesn\u2019t notice the sharp object in the road, which blows out one of his tires.  The scene then ends with Brian\u2019s father screaming, \u201cOh, for fuck\u2019s sake!\u201d<br/><br/>Scene Two<br/>The next scene takes place fifteen years later, at the mother\u2019s funeral.  It takes place in a relatively nice funeral home with beige carpeting.  It\u2019s an open casket funeral after there have been some speeches.  There is a large crowd, including many of the father\u2019s colleagues at the university and extended family members.  It\u2019s very hot, in the middle of summer, and there is a bright light coming through the stained glass windows.  A priest has just spoken and now people are milling around, offering condolences.<br/><br/>The scene begins with Brian\u2019s father saying, \u201cThank you, Gracie, I appreciate it.\u201d  Meanwhile, despite all the condolences, no one is looking into the casket.  Brian\u2019s father nevertheless shakes the old woman\u2019s hand and begins to smile.  People are rubbing their eyes, but only because of all the dust in the room, not because they are wiping away tears.  Furthermore, the decoration at the funeral home makes it seem like she died ten years ago.  While this is all going on, Brian whispers to someone, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, baby, I\u2019ll get us out of here.\u201d<br/><br/>The sound of everyone at the funeral murmuring blends together, creating the impression that everyone is underwater.  As a result, no one is hearing the priest\u2019s eulogy.  However, the loud sobbing of the mother-in-law cuts through the air.  Her husband walks over and consoles her.  Then Brian\u2019s father says to Brian, \u201cWell, I\u2019m glad you showed up.\u201d  Everyone turns towards him to see why he said that so loud, but Brian\u2019s father is \u2018underwater again\u2019 and doesn\u2019t notice.  Brian ends the scene by saying to someone, \u201cIf my father asks about me, tell him I\u2019ll be home later.\u201d<br/><br/>Scene Three<br/>The next scene takes place two days after the funeral, at the house.  Only Brian and his father are there and his father is kicking him out.  It\u2019s a really nice home befitting a college professor: three floors, velvet curtains, air conditioned.  The television is on in the background, turned to the nightly news.<br/><br/>Brian sneers at his father, \u201cYou\u2019re such a fucking fraud.\u201d  Brian\u2019s father furrows his now bald forehead, disappointed but not angry.  In the background, the television has a report on four more soldiers who died in Anbar province today.  There is a family photograph on the mantelpiece, taken on the edge of the Grand Canyon.  Brian slinks over the chair and sits down.  Brian\u2019s father tells him, \u201cBrian, I just think it\u2019s time.  We all need to move on.\u201d<br/><br/>Brian then pulls out a joint and lights it up.  Brian\u2019s father turns away, looking out the window into the front yard.  What\u2019s on the television has now changed: it\u2019s a commercial for Bounty, the Quicker Picker-Upper.  The garden is in full bloom, but there\u2019s no one to look after it now.  Brian then tells his father, \u201cYou\u2019re just jealous because I was out getting laid and you weren\u2019t.\u201d  Brian\u2019s father closes his eyes and listens for the ocean.  Meanwhile, Brian leaves the room and walks over to the fridge, looking for another beer from the six-pack.  Brian\u2019s father follows him, walking purposefully.  Brian picks up the phone and starts dialing up his girlfriend.  As he does this, Brian\u2019s father walks up and hangs up the phone.  Brian then takes a swing at his father and his father doubles back into the kitchen chair, causing both of them to fall down.  Brian then stands over his father, glaring.  Meanwhile, in the background, Brian\u2019s father can hear the sounds of the fridge buzzing and the dial tone from the phone. \u201cTwo weeks,\u201d he says, \u201cTwo weeks, and you\u2019re gone.\u201d<br/><br/>[At this point, Jackson\u2019s notes are more sparse and my memory much hazier, so rather than the back-and-forth of every detail, the rest of the scene descriptions will be more impressionistic.]<br/><br/>Scene Four<br/>This is an alternate funeral scene.  Instead of having it at a nice funeral home, we are in a cheap, tacky crematorium watching the wife\u2019s coffin go down the conveyor towards the furnace.  There are no priests or religious figures and there are only about five or six people there, including Brian and his father.<br/><br/>I must confess this is the scene that is the haziest to me.  The scene begins with Brian\u2019s father standing near the conveyor belt and intoning to himself, \u201cDeath shall have no dominion.\u201d  After a while, Brian hits his father up, asking him, \u201cCan you give me some money?\u201d  The others are shocked by his behavior and look at him incredulously.  Meanwhile, Brian\u2019s sister is in tears.  As Brian gets more impatient, he decides to leave for a cigarette break, prompting his father to yell out, \u201cWhat is wrong with you?\u201d  Brian just pulls out his cigarette inside the building, lights it up, and replies, \u201cSo does that mean you have the money?\u201d                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_217614">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EpsilonMinus" title="EpsilonMinus"><img alt="EpsilonMinus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EpsilonMinus">EpsilonMinus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217614/#Comment_217614" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-09T23:14:01+00:00" title="July  9, 2009 11:14PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 10, 2009 7:59PM by EpsilonMinus.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Scene Five<br/>This, in retrospect, ended up being the key scene of the game, in my opinion.  It takes place seven years before the road trip to the Grand Canyon.  The scene is set in the parents\u2019 bedroom in a cheap apartment that they were staying at while Brian\u2019s father was finishing up graduate school.  In the room are Brian\u2019s father, Brian\u2019s mother, and another man.  The bed is unmade, there is \u2018Barry White\u2019 R&amp;B music playing in the background and everyone is arguing loudly, which wakes up Brian and prompts him to investigate.<br/><br/>The scene begins with Brian entering the room.  He exclaims in surprise, \u201cDaddy, what is that man doing in your room and why is he naked?\u201d  Brian\u2019s father walks over and turns off the music while the unknown man covers himself up with the bed sheets.  At this point, unbeknownst to the others, Brian\u2019s father\u2019s erection subsides (this was probably the most interesting reveal of the story).  He says, \u201cBrian, go back to your room.  You\u2019re supposed to be asleep.\u201d  Then Brian\u2019s mom, after covering herself up, takes Brian by the shoulder and leads him out of the room.  In the hallway, Brian can be heard asking, \u201cMom, who is that man?\u201d  Then Brian\u2019s father turns to the man and says to him, \u201cI think you should leave.\u201d<br/><br/>Scene Six<br/>This scene takes place three days after the road trip.  The family has finally arrived at the Grand Canyon and they are right on the edge at a designated viewing point.  There are quite a few other tourists there and it is burning hot.<br/><br/>The scene opens with Brian\u2019s father saying, \u201cLook, Brian, isn\u2019t that amazing?\u201d  Brian callously responds, \u201cWow, it\u2019s a big fucking hole in the ground.  Can we leave now?\u201d  The tourists, especially the ones with young kids, give Brian a dirty look but he just ignores them.  He starts throwing rocks down the canyon and watching them fall.  Then his sister imitates him, doing the same thing, upon which Brian gets bored and walks over to a bench and sits down.  Brian\u2019s father then moves behind Brian and puts his hands on the back of the bench.  Disgusted, Brian gets up and moves to another bench.  Meanwhile, across the canyon, a big truck is driving by, kicking up dust.  Brian\u2019s father then goes up to Brian\u2019s sister, and says, "That's right, sweetie -- it goes all the way across the county!"  Brian, however, goes up to his mom and says, \u201cMom, can you buy me a pack of cigs?\u201d<br/><br/>[Jackson\u2019s notes pick back up here and are more detailed, though not complete as the first few were, so there will be more back-and-forth description, but I\u2019m probably still missing stuff.]<br/><br/>Scene Seven<br/>This scene takes place two days after the alternate funeral (the one in the crematorium).  It\u2019s the same home as in scene three, when Brian was getting kicked out.  However, this scene is taking place in the parents\u2019 bedroom (now only Brian\u2019s father\u2019s bedroom, I suppose).  Some facts about the room: the bed is unmade, there is a fan on the nightstand oscillating back and forth, and there are a bunch of art pieces decorating the walls.  Catherine (we named her here) has just gone back to college; she couldn\u2019t stay long because it was finals week and Brian and his father are alone.<br/><br/>Brian begins by yelling at his father: \u201cIt\u2019s great that Catherine was crying at the funeral.  I guess you didn\u2019t tell her the truth between you and Mom.\u201d  Brian\u2019s father hasn\u2019t shaved since the funeral.  Meanwhile, the fan is blowing Brian\u2019s hair back as it oscillates.  Brian\u2019s father then tells Brian, \u201cThe truth is that \xacshe loved her mother.\u201d  Then, Brian starts crying.  Brian\u2019s father tentatively walks over and places his hands on Brian\u2019s shoulders to try to comfort him.  Brian sits still for a moment.<br/><br/>Then he blurts out, \u201cDon\u2019t touch me, you fucking bastard!  This whole family is built on lies!\u201d causing Brian\u2019s father to pull back.  Brian then collapses on the bed and throws the unmade sheets over his face.  At the end of the scene, the power suddenly goes out.  The lights shut off, the fan stops, and Brian\u2019s father says, \u201cYes, but we built it, didn\u2019t we?  Where else are we supposed to live?\u201d<br/><br/>Scene Eight<br/>This scene goes way back in time, two years before Brian discovers the affair and takes place at Brian\u2019s sixth birthday party.  Brian\u2019s father is finishing up his undergraduate education, so this doesn\u2019t take place at the apartment.  Instead, they\u2019re in the backyard of the house.  It\u2019s a big backyard with a climbing tree.  They are opening presents and Brian has just opened his father\u2019s present: an Oxford English Dictionary.<br/><br/>Brian\u2019s father says, \u201cWhat do you think, Brian?  It\u2019s just like Daddy\u2019s.\u201d  Brian doesn\u2019t quite know how to respond and all the kids are looking at the gift, completely slack-jawed.  Finally, Brian politely says, \u201cThank you, Daddy.\u201d  Then he opens his mom\u2019s gift, which is a brand new video game.  Everyone thinks it cool and wants to look at it.  It gets passed around to the other kids.  Meanwhile, Brian\u2019s mom gives Brian\u2019s dad the \u2018I told you so\u2019 look, but Brian\u2019s dad just shakes his head and grins in a \u2018Yeah, you we\u2019re right\u2019 sort of fashion, and they exchange loving smiles.<br/><br/>Then Brian\u2019s father calls everyone over, \u201cHey kids, come get your ice cream.  I\u2019ve got Neapolitan or Butterscotch Ripple.\u201d  The kids are all excited and rush over.  Brian exclaims, \u201cWow, ice cream!  Thanks, Dad!\u201d                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_217615">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EpsilonMinus" title="EpsilonMinus"><img alt="EpsilonMinus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EpsilonMinus">EpsilonMinus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217615/#Comment_217615" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-09T23:14:11+00:00" title="July  9, 2009 11:14PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 10, 2009 11:03PM by EpsilonMinus.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Scene Nine<br/>This scene takes place in an alternate timeline, fifteen years after the road trip.  However, instead of the mother dying, it is the sister, Catherine, who has died.  She died while at college in a car wreck at the hands of a drunk driver.  The scene is set in the morgue, attached to the police station.  It is very sterile and Catherine\u2019s body is there under a bloody sheet.  There is also a phone in the room.  The people in the scene are Brian, his father, his mother, and the coroner.<br/><br/>Brian screams at the coroner, \u201cSo are they gonna find the guy that did this?\u201d  Brian then pulls out a cigarette and lights it up, his hands shaking.  Brian\u2019s father tries to calm him down: \u201cC\u2019mon, Brian, that\u2019s not important.  Just let the police deal with this\u201d but it doesn\u2019t calm Brian down.  Instead, it only makes him angrier, as he shouts, \u201cYou two would say that, wouldn\u2019t you?  She\u2019s just a mistake that wouldn\u2019t go away!\u201d  This causes Brian\u2019s father to take a swing at Brian and Brian goes down with his father on top of him.  Brian\u2019s mother rushes over to break it up as Brian\u2019s cigarette rolls out of his hand towards the table with Catherine\u2019s body on it.  \u201cNo, you were the mistake!  I don't know what I ever did to deserve you!\u201d Brian\u2019s father shouts.<br/><br/>Scene Ten<br/>The final scene is an alternate visit to the Grand Canyon that takes place nine years after Brian\u2019s sixth birthday party.  There was no affair (or at least, no one found out about it) and thus there is no sister, she was never born.  Other than that, it is basically the same place as in the other Grand Canyon scene.<br/><br/>\u201cWell, Brian, isn\u2019t that amazing?\u201d  Brian responds, \u201cYeah, it\u2019s alright.\u201d  As Brian\u2019s father wipes his forehead, Brian kicks a rock over the edge.  Brian\u2019s father looks down and watches the rock fall.  Meanwhile, Brian\u2019s mom is away from the other two, looking bored and fanning herself with a fashion magazine.  She\u2019s talking to another man, but Brian\u2019s father doesn\u2019t notice.  He\u2019s looking across the canyon at a big truck, driving by and kicking up dust.  Brian starts sniffling; he\u2019s allergic to the dust.<br/><br/>Brian\u2019s father then intones, \u201cYou know, sometimes it\u2019s nice to remind yourself that some things are bigger than you are.\u201d  Brian turns and sees his mother talking to the other man.  Brian\u2019s father is still oblivious, however, and just looks satisfied that he said something so wise.  Brian yawns while Brian\u2019s father\u2019s eyes turn towards a rock and then the car.  Brian then asks him, \u201cSo Dad, when we get home, you gonna buy me that new video game?\u201d<br/><br/>Commentary<br/><br/>The title should be pretty self-explanatory.  I really like the idea of the Grand Canyon as a metaphor for the emotional distance between the two characters, even though we never talked about it during the game and it was not my intention when I introduced it.  (In fact, I never thought about it until I realized that I needed a snappy title for my report!)<br/><br/>So, yeah, did I mention this game was awesome?  My only two regrets is that I undoubtedly missed some crucial descriptions from the later scenes and that the back-and-forth description sounds better during the game then it does written down, making this AP report an admittedly flawed representation of the game.<br/><br/>Many thanks to Daniel, who had to play the difficult role, while I just kicked up a lot of trouble and said the word \u2018fuck\u2019 a lot.  I really loved the ending lines to the seventh and ninth scenes and his classically understated descriptive response to the opening line of the third scene.  And, of course, many thanks to Jackson for writing the game, facilitating it after I bugged the hell out of him about it, and providing me with the notes to write this report.  (Sorry it took me so long.)<br/><br/>It goes without saying that I highly recommend it if Jackson chooses to go further with it and make it available.  It\u2019s a very \u2018avant-garde\u2019 type of game and I think you need to be in the right frame of mind for it, so it might not appeal to everyone, but I would at least recommend trying it out.  It\u2019s amazing what kind of story you can tell with only forty lines and a bunch of physical description.  (That being said, someone came up to me at GPNW and told me he tried Shock: based on Ogre\u2019s glowing recommendation of my game that I ran and it fell apart on him, so take my recommendation with a grain of salt, different strokes for different folks, etc.)<br/><br/>Thanks for reading this far and be happy that Jackson\u2019s wrists gave out on him or else it would be even longer!

And Jackson for taking such detailed notes, for that matter -- not to mention acting as audience &amp; facilitator. I think the presence of a 'third player' was crucial to my ability to cope with the game's relentless focus on a single two-person relationship. (In this case, not a very happy one.)<br/><br/>For those following along at home, here's a recap of how scenes play out in <i>The Hydra</i>:<br/><br/>1. There are only four lines of dialogue, total, between the two characters. Once the fourth line is spoken, the scene ends.<br/>1a. Consequently, there will be 40 total lines of dialogue spoken in a complete game.<br/>2. There is a theoretically unlimited amount of concrete, momentary, detail-oriented narrative description allowed <i>between</i> the four lines of dialogue.<br/>3. Narration goes back and forth between the two players. If the other player 'spoke' last, you have the option to respond with dialogue OR with a brief description. If you have 'spoken' last, you can only add description (until the other player decides to 'speak.')<br/>4. In this case we used a quarter and a dime to track the turns &amp; what options were available: if the dime is in front of you, it is your turn to narrate; when you narrate description you pass the dime to the other player; if the quarter is also in front of you, you have the option to add dialogue; when you speak a line of dialogue you pass the quarter as well as the dime. <br/><br/>I cannot emphasize enough how integral it was to have these physical indicators -- because there is always more description than dialogue, having a physical indication that someone is about to add one of their two lines (they put their finger on the dime <i>and</i> the quarter) really emphasizes the tension and weight of those moments <i>just before</i> they speak. I say 'emphasized' because of course the game's structure itself is what creates the tension in the first place, and gives so much weight to the few words spoken out loud.<br/><br/>This was definitely one of the most challenging roleplaying games I can remember playing, and one of the most intense games I've played face to face. The way the description moves back and forth, and the limits on dialogue really force you to consider your narration carefully. When I read through the scenes again, I can actually feel myself tensing up -- in part as a reaction to the content of the scenes but also because I remember <i>so vividly</i> how hard I was thinking about every single thing I 'said'. Just the physical sensation of putting my fingers on the quarter/dime, preparing to speak, comes back very clearly. <br/><br/>The relentless focus on two characters and a single relationship is also noteworthy -- I think especially in this case, because the relationship pattern was established so early and almost never changed. And what a crushing relationship it was (at least on the dad's side.) I actually think I felt, at times, as a player, much how Brian's dad must have felt -- I would propose alternate scenes, alternate outcomes, try to frame things differently... but I <i>couldn't fix it</i>, I <i>couldn't get away from this shitty relationship I somehow had with my son</i>. From this point of view the last scene is kind of amazing -- I actually <i>erased my own daughter, with whom I appeared to have had a positive and loving relationship</i>, just so that maybe my son wouldn't hate me quite so much. And it worked, <i>and I felt relieved.</i><br/><br/>I was using the structure of the game, the branching-off and the alternate scenes, to try and escape the reality of the in-fiction situation. And inexorably, within each scene, it was established again and again that <i>these were still the same people</i> and they still had the same problems. The game wouldn't let me change the fundamental nature of the relationship -- and it wouldn't let me look away, either. All I could do was focus on the buzzing of the fridge, or the dust plume on the horizon, or that one happy memory of a birthday party. And then, inevitably, I would have to say something -- and that just gave the son/Michael an opportunity to remind me how I had somehow failed as a father.<br/><br/>So yeah. You should play it. And that was a great session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_217625">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217625/#Comment_217625" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-10T01:32:51+00:00" title="July 10, 2009  1:32AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 10, 2009 1:34AM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And also, of course, it's not every game where you get to slide a dime across a table and say 'My erection subsides.' and have that stand alone as a meaningful narrative contribution.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: EpsilonMinus</cite>Many thanks to Daniel, who had to play the difficult role, while I just kicked up a lot of trouble and said the word \u2018fuck\u2019 a lot.</blockquote>\nYou deserve full credit, I'd say -- I thought you did a great job pushing the dysfunction of the relationship, and as you pointed out the fifth scene (which you set up) was totally pivotal. I mean, come on, when your very first narration in a scene is "Daddy, what is that man doing in your room, and why is he naked?" That's not a scene you get framed into every day!

Not only was it completely clear in my head -- the fan, the bed, the sheets -- there was just something about it -- how childlike it seemed; how we are never fully grown up when in the company of our parents, or maybe when confronted with death -- that totally shifted my sympathy towards Brian. And it had gotten a bit lopsided by that point, so that was crucial too.<br/><br/><br/>Random corrections (from memory):\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: EpsilonMinus</cite>Brian\u2019s father then goes up to Brian\u2019s sister, and says, \u201cIsn\u2019t that great, sweetie?\u201d</blockquote>\nI think he said: "That's right, sweetie -- it goes all the way across the county!"

I'll edit them into my report.  I was pretty much going on memory for scenes 4-6 and most of scene 8.  And thanks for your thoughts on the game, it was really interesting to read.  \n<blockquote>From this point of view the last scene is kind of amazing -- I actually erased my own daughter, with whom I appeared to have had a positive and loving relationship, just so that maybe my son wouldn't hate me quite so much. And it worked, and I felt relieved.</blockquote>\nThat last scene was interesting.  I saw it as being rather tragic because Brian's father did seem to have a positive relationship with his daughter (who, ironically, wasn't really his daughter) and, although that scene was not as confrontational as the others, it was also not a 'super duper everyone lives happily ever after' type scene but rather the kind of typical 'bored teenager gets dragged along on the family vacation and pretends to enjoy it' type of scene.  (And of course, Brian tries to hit him up for dough at the end of the scene - because he's still pretty much a bastard in this timeline; just a more well-behaved bastard.)\n<blockquote>The relentless focus on two characters and a single relationship is also noteworthy -- I think especially in this case, because the relationship pattern was established so early and almost never changed. And what a crushing relationship it was (at least on the dad's side.)

And then, inevitably, I would have to say something -- and that just gave the son/Michael an opportunity to remind me how I had somehow failed as a father.</blockquote>\nI agree.  It's interesting in how it mirrors a real-life relationship in that you really have no control over the other person, but you're still pretty much 'stuck' with them no matter what.  In that sense, the ability to 're-do' scenes can be somewhat illusory.  (It should be said that if I were more cooperative, we could have had a completely different type of scene, but I felt like this was not a relationship that would be healed so easily and that Brian was pretty much an asshole - I mean his traits were 'Rebellious' and 'Lazy.')\n<blockquote>You deserve full credit, I'd say -- I thought you did a great job pushing the dysfunction of the relationship, and as you pointed out the fifth scene (which you set up) was totally pivotal.

The possibility that I had actually somehow brought this misery on myself was pretty devastating -- as evidenced by the fact that I spent most of the rest of the game trying to somehow mitigate/avoid that possibility.</blockquote>\nIt actually came to mind after that alternate funeral you framed the scene before.  I'd kind of been playing Brian as a sort of mindless jackass, but I had to stop and wonder why someone would be so callous at their own mother's funeral.  And then you had framed Catherine being brought to tears (and other than the mother-in-law, I think that was the only person who cried at either of the funerals).  So I thought it would be ironic if Catherine was the product of this deep, dark family secret.  So the scene gave the audience an understanding of Brian's motivations.  And it also changed things in that I think Brian's real hatred was more aimed at his mother and that his father was sort of the 'collateral damage' who bore the brunt of Brian's acting out (maybe because his mom was too distant to actually care).\n<blockquote>I cannot emphasize enough how integral it was to have these physical indicators -- because there is always more description than dialogue, having a physical indication that someone is about to add one of their two lines (they put their finger on the dime and the quarter) really emphasizes the tension and weight of those moments just before they speak. I say 'emphasized' because of course the game's structure itself is what creates the tension in the first place, and gives so much weight to the few words spoken out loud.</blockquote>\nEdit: Oh, and this!  I absolutely agree.  If you do more with the text, Jackson, you should definitely codify this in the rules.  It was both an ingenious way to keep track of who could describe/say what and a great tension-builder.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_217835">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217835/#Comment_217835" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-12T00:22:00+00:00" title="July 12, 2009 12:22AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You guys are both so, so amazing - as players to play alongside of, as entertainers of a removed audience, and as archivists. <br/>i've just finished my third sitting of reading sections of this, but life keeps pulling me away from the computer, so i'm just going to say how<br/>grateful i am for this document, and for witnessing the play of this tragedy. <br/><br/>i wanted to add that, for me as audience, many of the revelations that are treated as concrete here in this revisitation were not so definite when<br/>playing, due to the restrictions on character-to-character communication. even in the extreme example of the question of catherine's father; when<br/>i witnessed that scene, nothing was made clear.

When I framed that scene, it was done so with the intention of throwing Catherine's parentage into question, but you are correct in saying that it is never definitively established in the fiction that this is the case.  I suppose the 'concreteness' in the report probably reflects my own interpretive biases, so it's nice to hear your take on it as an audience member.<br/><br/>As for explaining motives, I also agree that there is a lot about these characters' lives that is outside of our purview.  I think the question that ultimately goes unexplained was why Brian had such an uneasy relationship with the rest of his family.  The discovery of the affair I certainly saw as this 'powder keg' moment that launched Brian on a certain trajectory, but even in the final scene where the affair was never discovered, there was (at least I thought) a sense of unease that perhaps this family's problems hadn't vanished after all, but were just more cleverly concealed.<br/><br/>Another interesting thing about the game is that the focus on two characters also constrains our interpretations because so much is hidden.  For instance, I said I thought that perhaps Brian's mom was distant, but I think part of that is that we could never really hear from her or focus on her, so that made her seem distant.  It would be interesting to do another game of The Hydra focusing on another relationship in this family (husband-wife, father-daughter, mother-son, brother-sister) and discover what was left unsaid or unseen in this story.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jackson tegu</cite>obviously i am again enthused about this project - it has been earmarked for removal from the shelf and returned to the back burner until such time as i can really sit down with it.
