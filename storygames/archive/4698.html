The current mechanics do nothing for this, that has been well documented. I was sitting in Midnight Espresso in Wellington, reading Grey Ranks. The grid caught my eye (as it does). And that started off a chain of thoughts...<br/><br/>The map of The City is a|state is, for those of you who might not be familiar with the game, an iconic image that appears as a visual cue throughout the book. It's a series of concentric circles, with eight radiating lines (these all represent the main canals which cut through The City). I'd been thinking about how to track changes in communities, but simple numbers appeared unsatisfying. Then it hit me: the map. Use the iconic image of the map as some form of visual tracking. Place different elements such as Community, Violence, Wealth and Poverty at the ends of the radial lines and use markers to show communities moving towards or away from these aspects.<br/><br/>I've really not got much further than that, but I just wanted to share that. It was a one of those "Aha! That would be great!" moments.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malcolm<br/><br/>edit: for those who have no idea of what I'm blithering on about, you can see what I mean via the wonders of the venerable <a href="http://www.contestedground.co.uk/astdload.html" rel="nofollow">a|stateLite</a> download.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105761/#Comment_105761" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-31T15:31:54+00:00" title="October 31, 2007  3:31PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a pretty cool idea, but wouldn't, say, a general uprising make everything cram together into a tiny sector?<br/><br/>Unless I am envisioning it wrong....<br/><br/>Would you put opposites at the end of each line?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105763">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105763/#Comment_105763" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-31T15:39:47+00:00" title="October 31, 2007  3:39PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's an exciting idea, and a great cafe!

So, Community &lt;&gt; Violence (?), Wealth&lt;&gt;Poverty, and that's about as far as my thinking had taken me at this moment in time. It's very vague and up in the air at the moment. Not sure about the uprising thing make stuff cram together. Would an uprising induce poverty (maybe)?

Comfort, Opportunity, Safety, for example. You could increase Opportunity with an influx of people, but Safety would go down as crime necessarily increased.<br/><br/>Or you could split the map into quadrants, each representing an area like Poverty, Crime, Decay. Add NPCs to the quadrants. Then each quadrant becomes a small r-map.  And some (valuable) NPCs would straddle quadrants. <br/><br/>The NPCs could be influential in those quads - a crime boss, factory owner, politico in which case the group could go on missions to 'attack' the NPCs. <br/><br/>But they could just be <i>indicative</i> of the quadrant, so fixing a relationship with a girlfriend in 'Decay' makes the city a bit less sad.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105778">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105778/#Comment_105778" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-31T16:30:09+00:00" title="October 31, 2007  4:30PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you are having opposites at the opposite end of the axes, that's cool, but it only allows (assuming a two-dimensional map), two axes, not 4 (which is what the eight pointed star would imply).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig" title="Malcolm Craig"><img alt="Malcolm Craig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/contestedground/UntitledAlbum/photo?authkey=UQZ1oivg8Lc#5239981636020065186"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig">Malcolm Craig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105780/#Comment_105780" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-31T16:35:42+00:00" title="October 31, 2007  4:35PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 31, 2007 4:52PM by Malcolm Craig.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>If you are having opposites at the opposite end of the axes, that's cool, but it only allows (assuming a two-dimensional map), two axes, not 4 (which is what the eight pointed star would imply).</blockquote>\nHmmm...I'm thinking that there are 4 axes, as there are 8 spokes running from the centre of the map.

Or whatever numbers are on those axes.<br/><br/>Now let's say one thing changes. There's a massive run on linoleum supplies and mauve carpeting becomes vastly more widespread.  That means Finland's dot on the map needs to move straight up, to reflect that mauve carpets now outnumber linoleum floors.  <br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://cobweb.scarymonsters.net/~corleyj/images/miscpix/astatemap4.gif"/><br/><br/>But we have a problem. Because straight up also affects rushing/passing percentage and violence/peace! We now have a map that tells us that the high school football team is rushing 80 percent of the time and that we're only 5 percent more peaceful than violent. Eventually if we get enough mauve carpet, Finland will erupt in uncontrollable riots!<br/><br/>There's a reason flat maps are called "two dimensional".  They can only track two dimensions of independent variables!<br/><br/>Now, if you wanted to have the diagonal axes be related somehow to the vertical/horizontal axes, that could get interesting, and could be used to make a political statement. What if I replaced the Rushing Percentage line with one that was Atheism/Religosity?  The way I put that axis on the map would make a political statement about whether I see an increase in religosity as decreasing or increasing a community's wealth and violence level...<br/><br/>And that could be hot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105792">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Shevaun" title="Shevaun"><img alt="Shevaun" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Shevaun">Shevaun</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105792/#Comment_105792" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-31T17:17:35+00:00" title="October 31, 2007  5:17PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good visualisation there, cheers for that.

Movement would trace out shapes.  Examples follow:<br/><br/>Here is Finland's initial state in our new system:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://cobweb.scarymonsters.net/~corleyj/images/miscpix/astatemap5.gif"/><br/><br/>Analyzing Finland's current condition, we find that:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://cobweb.scarymonsters.net/~corleyj/images/miscpix/astatemap6.gif"/><br/><br/>Finland is modestly wealthy, prefers linoleum and violence a little bit and Finland High rushes the football a lot.<br/><br/>Now a new coach is hired at Finland High and he puts a new passing game in place. We graph the new line segment representing Finland. Nothing has changes except the rushing/passing coordinate for the red dot:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://cobweb.scarymonsters.net/~corleyj/images/miscpix/astatemap7.gif"/><br/><br/>If we connect the old Finland red dot to the new Finland red dot, we make a triangle. Every time you change just one coordinate, or both coordinates on the same set of axes, you will create a triangle, actually.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://cobweb.scarymonsters.net/~corleyj/images/miscpix/astatemap8.gif"/><br/><br/>But if we change a coordinate for BOTH points, then we create a quadrilateral.  Say we get a new coach at Finland High AND people start buying mauve carpets in great quantity.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://cobweb.scarymonsters.net/~corleyj/images/miscpix/astatemap9.gif"/><br/><br/>This creates a quadrilateral. (Or, two connected triangles if you prefer, but in any event four line segments.)<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://cobweb.scarymonsters.net/~corleyj/images/miscpix/astatemap10.gif"/><br/><br/>These shapes might be interesting for ya, don't know...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105820">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105820/#Comment_105820" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-31T22:00:40+00:00" title="October 31, 2007 10:00PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 31, 2007 10:01PM by Simon_C.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the idea that changing position on one axis naturally changes your position on others as well.  I also like the idea of the physical world changing to reflect the changes on the axis, so that the City is constantly shifting as relationships change.  That's cool to me.  <br/><br/>I think that possibly the chart Jason is using is a bit misleading though, because he's charting movements in two dimensions (x, y), wheras the map you're talking about works kinda differently, because it's circular, and movement is either around the pole, or towards or away from it.  The kinds of movement Jason's talking about aren't possible on your map (if you want them to move through discrete units on the map).  <br/><br/>Movement around the map needs to be as natural a progression as movement along the axis.  That will require some pretty carefully selected values for the axis, because adjacent ones will have to be thematically similar, or consequences of each other.  Here's one such arrangement:<br/><br/>Hope, Wealth, Greed, Violence, Despair, Poverty, Generosity, Peace<br/><br/>These are arrayed around points in order, so that Hope is between Generosity and Wealth, and opposite Despair.  So a communtiy in a high level of Poverty can move towards wealth either directly (by moving towards the pole) or it can do so by passing through despair, and violence and greed, or it can go the other route, Generosity, Peace, Hope.  <br/><br/>So I think that the distance from the pole could represent the power of the community, its size or influence, and then the position around the pole determines the dominant characteristic of that community.  <br/><br/>That's one way to do it, anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105838">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105838/#Comment_105838" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-01T01:49:45+00:00" title="November  1, 2007  1:49AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that's what I was trying to get at by suggesting non-independent axes and a political statement made thereby.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105843">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil" title="Neil"><img alt="Neil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil">Neil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105843/#Comment_105843" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-01T02:42:24+00:00" title="November  1, 2007  2:42AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you want something like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar_chart" rel="nofollow">radar chart</a>.

You could take the chart and have each community/figure/character represented by a counter. Success in conflicts/missions/whatever might move you one step one way, whereas failure another way. As you cross into the different coloured bands the makeup/demeanour/outlook/whatever of the community changes. <br/><br/>You could tie events to crossing bands too, so as you switch from a low shift to high shift area, the next session/scene has to include a shift of some kind, and so on.<br/><br/>EDIT to add: I love how Grey Ranks ties different situation elements to each square on the grid, and scenes and stories are drawn from these. You could do something similar, having it so that the communities themselves have a changing set of situation elements depending on where they are on the grid (homeless man asleep in a doorway, the sound of engines roaring deep below etc), and when action takes place in those communities, you bring these elements in somehow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105874">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105874/#Comment_105874" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-01T06:21:35+00:00" title="November  1, 2007  6:21AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Because I've got way too much time on my hands, a visual representation of what I was talking about earlier:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2122/1814071898_9c4200fa68.jpg?v=0"/><br/><br/>So it's basically just a two-axis graph with the horizontal axis bent around to meet itself.
