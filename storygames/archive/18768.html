You play characters who are seeking to deal with their own Perversity by hunting down those who have already given in to theirs, and transformed into literal monsters and creatures of the night.<br/><br/><a href="https://nathan-paoletta.squarespace.com/s/Imp-Alpha-Playtest-13.pdf" rel="nofollow">Here's the direct PDF download.</a><br/><br/>This game has been in the works for, geez, years, but it started coming together in it's present form about a year ago. This draft is totally playable, though maybe a little rough around some edges. It's gone through a couple rounds of internal playtesting, and I'd love to get some feedback from a wider sphere of interested folks.<br/><br/>A couple key conceits of the game:<br/><br/>- the default mode of the play is episodic, mission- and party-based play, so<br/>- it's built to accommodate fluctuating attendance and single-sessions of play<br/>- there's a GM role (the Editor)<br/>- the key tension of the game is whether your character will give in to their Perversity and embrace their Imp - it's not deterministic that this will happen, but it's always there, tempting you. If/when a character does give in, then they actually take on the Editor role for the next Chapter of play, and prep their former character as the new antagonist for the group. The former Editor makes a new character to join the group, and so on.<br/>- it uses a fairly simple d6-based die pool system that pulls a lot of information out of each roll, and rolls matter in terms of affecting both your characters immediate prospects and their long-term development over time<br/><br/>There's some more details <a href="http://ndpdesign.com/playtest" rel="nofollow">at my playtest page as well</a>.

When I got to that part, my first concern was that it could grind our campaign to a halt. Even if a group were to house-rule that the regular Editor still GMs, though, the threat of losing your character is still quite a disincentive to act like a murderhobo. Kind of reminds me of Undying's humanity mechanics that way.<br/><br/>As for the opposite kind of group \u2013\xa0where multiple players are <i>vying</i> to be Editor, and thus all playing DPs at their darkest and creepiest \u2013\xa0I feel like that is <i>exactly the group I would want to play this with.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421050">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421050/#Comment_421050" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-03T17:02:40+00:00" title="September  3, 2013  5:02PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh yah, you can drive for it, for sure.

I'm thinking in any such situation there's probably someone who actively wants to become the Editor, so basically whoever volunteers. I don't know if there needs to be a hard mechanism, beyond something like "in the event that you simply cannot decide who should be the next Editor, whoever hit 0 Perversity first, or dice off for it if need be."<br/><br/>So far in playtest, there's a group sense of whoever is closest to going over, and players seem to "wait" for that to resolve, if that makes sense. That might just be my local play culture, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421099">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421099/#Comment_421099" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-05T08:00:57+00:00" title="September  5, 2013  8:00AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This looks like fun.<br/>How friendly do you think this is to online play, maybe using Hangouts or something like that?<br/>Does it require a shared play mat (like Annalise) or a lot of dice (like Vesna Thaw) ?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421131">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421131/#Comment_421131" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-05T15:29:53+00:00" title="September  5, 2013  3:29PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We played it in hangouts last night and it was fine!
