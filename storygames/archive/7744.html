It went pretty well.  There were two things that came up that I had questions on:<br/><br/>  1.)  Can you make an NFA check to help someone else out?  Specifically, the Sarge wanted to roll NFA to yank some guy from Close to Near.  This seemed like a reasonable thing for a Sarge to do and I also ruled that it'd mess up the trooper's shot if he went later.  But it wasn't clear if you could use your NFA to help someone out.<br/><br/>  2.)  More broadly, it seemed as though for a one-shot the ideal mix was to have the Sarge go all out for NFA while everyone else goes all out for FA.  By letting the Sarge make the Dominance roll, he'd probably win it and then everyone would be at optimal range.  Since everyone else had full up FA, they'd be shredding the aliens.  If anything needed searching, just send the Sarge to do it.  The guy who chose an even 5/5 split was a little annoyed since the FA 8 guys snarfed up most of the kills -- more, they would get kills and let someone lower down cause everyone else to fail and prevent the aliens from getting kills.<br/><br/>  It's obvious that it wouldn't work over the long-haul but what are good ways to force individual troopers to make NFA tests (and not rely on the Sarge), so that this kind of min-maxing isn't optimal for a one-shot?<br/><br/>later<br/>Tom                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171867/#Comment_171867" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-29T07:39:09+00:00" title="September 29, 2008  7:39AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have tasks that require more than one participant to succeed?<br/><br/>Or tests that require everyone to pass. Like "Climb this ridge!" or something, with people who fail getting injured in the climb. Or even just missing out on the encounter at the top of the ridge. "Looks like Sarge and Trooper 5/5 are going to get these three threat tokens' worth of kills." <br/><br/>Some movement-based special alien abilities might help as well.  If the aliens try retreating (via fast movement, leaping, whatever), the ability to make NFA checks to not get moved beyond far range will be fairly important. Getting knocked out of the encounter will hurt those kill counts, too. Or they're stuck with an inappropriate weapon against a Swarming menace and can't change it for their life, or Far Range against a Reduce Visibility foe, or whatever.<br/><br/>But really, yeah, Development rolls are totally where the money's at when it comes to NFA. Maybe let the PCs make a few before the first mission for a one-shot? Letting the people with NFA get better weapons, and maybe upgrade them: sure, that 8 FA is impressive, but so is 5 FA with an 3d10-kill Rocketpod and a decent chance of setting the initial range at Far.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zipht" title="zipht"><img alt="zipht" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/173668_1770784817_2474986_q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zipht">zipht</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171879/#Comment_171879" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-29T09:27:21+00:00" title="September 29, 2008  9:27AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In two weeks I am runing a 3:16 one shot. <br/><br/>I think I will give one Development Roll before the drop..

If the group wants an NFA roll to get someone else out of trouble then you should do it. The rule isn't in the book though, in case it encouraged people to place others in trouble and make it un-fun for a low success.<br/><br/>Here's just some stuff off the top of my head about these things...<br/><br/><strong>One/Two Player Games</strong><br/><a href="http://www.collective-endeavour.com/node/1380#comment-7514" rel="nofollow">one/two-player games</a> and an <a href="http://esotericmurmurs.blogspot.com/2008/08/terra-fck-yeah.html" rel="nofollow">excellent example of one</a> from the web.<br/><br/><strong>Things you can do for a one-shot?</strong><br/>--Give Troopers a Strength each and no Weaknesses. Give the Corporal and the Sergeant a Weakness each and no Strengths.<br/>--Give everyone a single Development Roll before starting play. This can be used for the usual stuff (weapon upgrade or gaining a new weapon only, since they can't gain rank as they don't meet the requirements).<br/>--Give everyone a Weakness to start but anyone can use their Development Roll at the start of play to "upgrade" their Weakness to a Strength rather than for something else.<br/>--Don't pick a low AA equation from the list (that's fine for campaign play and part of the curve) but for a one-shot you want something that gives an AA of 7 or 8. I'd be tempted to just go for 8 to be honest.<br/>--Pick a really "meaty" Special Ability for the aliens. There are some in the list that are part of campaign play but aren't as "punchy" for one-shots. For one-shots I particularly recommend: Ambush, Armour, Exploding Bodies, Lasting Wounds, Regeneration, Suicide, Swarm.<br/>--Roll two "planets" into one session, and prep. two different aliens. Allow the PCs to upgrade between planets as usual (gaining Level and so on). Keep the AA at 8 for the second planet.<br/>--If someone dies before the final encounter allow them to drop back in between encounters with a new PC who has no Flashbacks available (but is fully healthy, with different stats if they wish, etc.).<br/><br/>Be wary that the "curve" of campaign play is weighted towards a lot of successful PC carnage at the beginning (since the party is awash with Flashbacks), then it gets stickier as the rate of Flashbacks entering the group doesn't match the number being used up, before the advantage drifts back to the PCs further on in the campaign as all their stats approach 10 and Flashbacks come in from PC death. So, fully beefed-up Troopers on mission one against a low AA opponent is (deliberately) like shooting fish in a barrel. Starve them of Flashbacks to start and they will have a rough time.<br/><br/>If I were doing a one-off like Predator or Aliens then it's probably expected that there will be PC death and a a rough ride.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172760">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TomR" title="TomR"><img alt="TomR" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomR">TomR</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172760/#Comment_172760" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-03T06:16:04+00:00" title="October  3, 2008  6:16AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the comments.
