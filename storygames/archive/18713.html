Ultimately the Admiral ousts the First Minister, sending him to the brig, but not before a pre-recorded warning message is broadcast, allowing him to become a Perspective. The Admiral institutes a military junta to make sure the public is not told about the source of the space madness, ensuring that the Orion's esential FTL capabilities will remain unscrutinised. But the people are not at all pleased with military rule, and the madness is spreading...<br/> <br/>\tAs with most GMless games, Kingdom is VERY accessible to new players, even those who have no experience with RPGs in general. Which is great! Writing good crossroads is somewhat difficult at first - I think a better one would have been "Will the kingdom disable the potentially-dangerous FTL drive?" or something to that effect, because in many cases our scenes drifted towards that question rather than the specific crossroad of "tell the public yes/no." I also found that at times we played it a bit too much like Fiasco, focusing on interpersonal relations rather than on the broader fate of the Kingdom, but I think that was just us adjusting to a new game. The tripartite role system is fascinating, and I look forward to playing more and exploring it further!<br/> <br/>\tEDIT: Kingdom is a very, very effective Battlestar Galactica simulator, so I'm also curious to see how it fares with other kinds of genres and settings.<br/> </blockquote>\n<br/>Exactly <a href="/forums/profile/Felan">@Felan</a>. A good Crossroad is the heart &amp; soul of a good Kingom game.<br/><br/>That's a tricky case. Crossroads have to be things all the characters can know about so they can deal with it, which makes a Crossroad that's effectively about keeping a secret from the Kingdom slippery, as you point out. It's basically a logical contradiction: will the Kingdom tell itself something? It stops being a decision about what the Kingdom will do and becomes a decision about what a few characters within the Kingdom will do.<br/><br/>Compare that to a recent game we played where the Kingdom was the city government -- not the city itself, but the Mayor's office, etc (in <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Story-Games-Seattle/messages/boards/thread/36871252" rel="nofollow">corrupt Prohibition-era Seattle</a>, of course). We could have Crossroads about what the Kingdom secretly did to the city, because the city wasn't the Kingdom.<br/><br/>In your game if your Kingdom was the Orion and not the whole Fleet that Crossroad could have totally worked -- the military deciding what to tell the civilians. Picking the scope of your Kingdom is an important decision ("are we the city or just the government of the city"). There's going to be some discussion of that in the appendices and I'll include a note about exactly this kind of thing.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420014">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420014/#Comment_420014" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-13T19:20:26+00:00" title="August 13, 2013  7:20PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 13, 2013 7:24PM by Felan.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the response, and for making a really interesting game!\n<blockquote>Compare that to a recent game we played where the Kingdom was the city government -- not the city itself, but the Mayor's office, etc (in <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Story-Games-Seattle/messages/boards/thread/36871252" rel="nofollow">corrupt Prohibition-era Seattle</a>, of course).

We ended up with a funny dynamic because all the characters <i>except </i>the touchstone were part of the smaller Kingdom of "the military and government leaders of the fleet," and so much of the game was played in that way, with the touchstone (my character) chiming in occasionally to explain how the public felt about the things they didn't know about (I tried to show signs of the cover-up like soldiers guarding the water supply and such causing a general malaise, even though the specific truth was concealed).<br/><br/>Looking forward to the final version! We had a great game, but I think the clarification about different scales of Kingdoms will help avoid these issues.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
