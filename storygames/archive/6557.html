The first hour-and-a-half or so was spent making or finalizing characters and setting the group story seed.  We then had a little over an hour of play, comprised of three Character Scenes and one Conflict Scene.<br/><br/>Here's the setup:<br/><br/><b>Players:</b> Andy (Volt Codec), David (Keru Koteru), Hans (Ton), Jason (Gavis), Lesley (Morgan), Lori (Zoe)<br/><br/><b>Group Story Seed:</b> All the characters received dreams of the Dragon, brief flashes of the destruction it would ultimately cause, and knowledge of where to find it.

He keeps a link with her whenever possible.  He hasn't figured out if he can fall for an A.I. or not.  <i>Toggle</i> - The eldest of the Coven.  A sort of Sage and Hippie mixed up and poured into a Geek mold.  It was his ingenuity and genius that brought the Coven to life, and saved Volt from a life of ambiguous poverty on the streets of a torn Empire.  He also happens to be the techno-doc that augmented Volt's body to what it is now.<br/><b>Links:</b> <i>Teche Nocht</i> - Imperial Guard that seeks to hunt down Volt and prove he is guilty...of something.

One, in the distance, is surrounded by a whirling cloud of dust or smoke that obscures virtually everything within its boundaries.  Closer to them, another town is being used as a garrison by a Kanissian heavy armor unit.  Our heroes discuss whether they should avoid the town, walk straight in, or sneak in from the side.  Ultimately, sneaking prevails.<br/><br/><b>Scene 2 (Character):</b><br/>Our heroes have snuck into town.  Ton and Keru Koteru decide to hide out and keep watch while the others come up with a cover story for why they're in the area.  Just as they begin to discuss this, a patrol of soldiers rounds the corner, confronting them.  Zoe quickly convinces the soldiers to take our heroes to their captain.  On the way, they see the center of the operation in the town, where two steam-powered battlesuits are undergoing maintenance.  The Captain is poring over a series of charts (Gavis steals one, Volt takes pictures of several more), and doesn't wish to deal with our heroes.  Since they are not putting up any kind of resistance, she orders some of her men to escort our heroes back up the road and out of the valley.<br/><br/><b>Scene 3 (Conflict)</b><br/>Ton and Keru have been following along on the rooftops.  Ton gives Keru an explosive charge to plant in one of the battlesuits.  Meanwhile, Volt fakes exhaustion and cramps to distract the soldiers; when they move towards him, Gavis pulls knives and starts the fight.<br/><br/>Some highlights:<br/>* Volt cuts the tubes running from the soldier's power packs to their pneumatic rifles; Ton then grabs the tubes from two soldiers and fuses them together, sending a massive shockwave through both soldiers.<br/>* Zoe using her wings to kick up a huge dust cloud, blinding and confusing the soldiers.<br/>* Keru zipping by on his shield and grabbing the rifle out of the hands of a solider just as he's about to fire.<br/>* Gavis's burrowing/exploding daggers flinging dirt and shrapnel everywhere while he munches on a carrot.<br/>* Keru accomplishes the Achievement [3] Plant the charge in the battlesuit.<br/><br/>Our heroes defeat the Lieutenant and his squad of soldiers handily and hide themselves in an empty building before reinforcements arrive.<br/><br/><b>Scene 4 (Character)</b><br/>Holed up in their hiding spot, our heroes discuss what they saw on the maps and charts in the Captain's office.  One map showed the next town over, which they had seen surrounded by the dust/smoke cloud earlier.  The map is labeled with words like "fuel depot", "generator tents", and, in one big area in the middle, "The Tank".  Another map shows the entire valley, with a town near it's center marked with large red X.  Our heroes discuss the situation and decide that the best course of action is to investigate this "Tank" and hopefully steal it for their own ends.  Just as they're finishing this conversation, there's a loud explosion from outside as the charge Keru planted earlier finally explodes.  It seems they have a hand distraction for sneaking out of town...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145449">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/amnesiack" title="amnesiack"><img alt="amnesiack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1012/830711303_f5d26761f6_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/amnesiack">amnesiack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145449/#Comment_145449" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-22T10:43:36+00:00" title="May 22, 2008 10:43AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Comments, Observations, and Questions:</b><br/><br/>Here's some of what I observed:<br/><br/>* For some reason, Anima Prime tends to bring out the silly in some people.  I had expressed an interest in trying to have a heroic but serious game, but the first conflict became slap-sticky pretty fast, despite the discussions we'd had about mood in advance.  I'm not sure why this is, but this is the second time that I've seen this happen in playtests of this game.<br/><br/>* One of the players has a tendency to want to avoid conflicts through talking/negotiation.  This can cause some problems in Anima Prime, since it's a very action/conflict-oriented game, especially when the other players are chomping at the bit to get to some action.  I may try to introduce a Duel of Wits style conflict in a future session so that talking/negotiating <i>is</i> conflict, but I'm not sure if that will help or not.  This may just not be that player's type of game.<br/><br/>* I explained the conflict rules in advance and got sort of glazed/confused looks from everyone.  However, once we got into our first actual conflict, everyone picked it up very quickly.<br/><br/>* I'm not very good at setting punchy Character Scenes.  All three of them in this session were just sort of meh.  Now that the players have been introduced to the system, I'm going to start looking to them to suggest Character Scenes that they want to see, which will hopefully bring things up a bit.<br/><br/>* The character sheet probably needs to be double-sided.  It doesn't include any space for fleshing out Eidolons or Soulbound weapons, unless you try to cram them in teeny-tiny style in the powers section.  A space for the Character Story Seed would be nice too, even if it's also written on the "master" story seed sheet.<br/><br/>Player Comments/Observations and my thoughts in relation to them:<br/><br/>* The players (almost universally) wanted to gain Charge Dice more quickly than they could.  One player suggested that Maneuvers should be 3-4 Strike, 5-6 Charge (though I think if that was implemented then the decrease in Strike dice would be to their detriment).  Other suggestions were more Passive powers that helped you get Charge dice more quickly or the ability for each individual character to set their own Strike/Charge numbers for maneuvers.  I think that the pacing for Charge dice works fairly well as it is for the majority of powers, but for a few (such as the character with Life Transfer) it can be difficult to ever reach the charge threshold necessary to make use of them.<br/><br/>* One player observed that game has a great short-term reward cycle (strike and charge dice, awesome tokens) but that he would like a more immediate/granular long-term reward cycle.  Essentially, I think he wants something like an experience point system.  I've pointed him to the Character Advancement section of the book (which we won't be making much use of in the short-term, most likely), and I'm curious to see if that satisfies him or not.<br/><br/>* Some players found the distinction between Conflict and Character scenes to be either confusing or undesirable.  I think this is an individual play-style matter, rather than an issue with the game itself, but it was mentioned, so it's a possible concern.<br/><br/>* Some players are concerned that the Maneuver/Strike/Charge distinction will severely bog down bigger conflicts.  Part of the issue is the size of our group.  Six players tends to bog down big conflicts in any task resolution type system.  I think some of it is also perspective.  The distinction between Maneuvers and Strikes can be interpreted as a division between "attacks" and "damage" that adds an extra step.  On the other hand, Anima Prime lacks the "whiff" factor of some traditional games, where your attacks miss or are defended against 1/2 to 2/3 of the time.  Because a Maneuver almost always nets you <i>something</i> and any total failure (whether a Maneuver, Strike, or Achievement) lets you keep your dice, I think it more than balances out the "extra step" between actions and their consequences.  And with Awesome Tokens thrown in, even that extra step is sometimes a non-issue.<br/><br/>Questions:<br/><br/>* Do Eidolons count as allies for the purposes of gaining Charge Dice with the Compassion passion?  My inclination was no, but I wasn't really sure.<br/><br/>* Can Awesome Tokens be used for a Refresh action?  I allowed it, but it's not specifcialy stated in the text.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_145462">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145462/#Comment_145462" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-22T11:25:48+00:00" title="May 22, 2008 11:25AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Lukas,<br/><br/>Thanks for writing this all up!

I might be shorter than usual because I have to use part of my lunch time to answer (computer at home's still messed up).<br/><br/>First of: yeah, wow, 6 PCs is a lot.

I'd make the same call you did.  I should probably rewrite it to say "PCs" in the description of the passion.<br/><br/>As for awesome tokens, you mean using them for Catching Your Breath?

Did everybody buy into that during the mood discussion?</b><br/>Good question.  Most of the mood/story seed discussion took place via email.  At the time everyone either agreed directly or didn't object, but that's not the same as full buy-in, for sure.  I probably will bring it up, just to cement things one way or the other, but since the majority of the players seem to be pushing in that direction, I won't insist on a change if that's what they really want.<br/><br/><b>Did you have links from the players to work with for your character scenes?</b><br/>Since the characters were mostly finalized as we were beginning the game, I didn't have much to work with in that capacity.  I plan to spend some time brainstorming over them in the next two weeks, since I have copies of all the characters now.<br/><br/><b>I see you had one goal in that conflict. Did you suggest it or the player? Are they clear on the fact that they can suggest goals, and all the things they can do with that?</b><br/>I suggested it.  The primary goal of this session was to introduce the basics of the system to everyone.  At the end of the night, we did discuss the fact that players can suggest goals in conflicts as well.  Now that everyone understands the basics of the game to some extent, I'm looking forward to making much more heavy use of goals in general.<br/><br/><b>For the players who are not so comfortable with the scene/conflict division, do they have experience playing console RPGs at all?</b><br/>Maybe a little, but definitely much less so than the other players involved, now that you mention it.<br/><br/><b>I'm afraid that giving more charge dice is going to lead to powers overshadowing maneuvers and achievements. I wouldn't want that to happen, but I can see that players would initially focus on their explicit special powers rather than exploring the other options.</b><br/>I can definitely see that side of it.  The majority of the players are coming from backgrounds in more traditional games that fall into the "you can only do the things defined as skills/powers on your character sheet" and may not be fully comfortable or cognizant about how much they can do with just maneuvers/strikes/achievements.  Then again, if I've got a power on my sheet, I can definitely understand the impulse to want to use it whenever I can.<br/><br/><b>You can also point your friend who wants more rewards to the Items optional mechanics and see if that would scratch the itch (the example specifically works with the Ghostfield setting).</b><br/>I talked with him briefly a little while ago, and once he read the advancement chapter, he felt better about the game's potential for long-term play.  I like the item system a lot as well, but I decided not to use it in this particular playtest because of its short length and the desire not to complicate the learning curve or bog-down the pace with inventory management.  In a long-term game, I would definitely use it, probably giving everyone "Use Item I" as a reward for achieving a small-ish goal in the first or second session and then working up from there.  EDIT: I think using the Power Slots optional rules would also allow for more specific, granular growth, at the cost of making starting powers somewhat weaker.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_145526">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan" title="Brendan"><img alt="Brendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.xorph.com/images/miniludie.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan">Brendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145526/#Comment_145526" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-22T14:34:17+00:00" title="May 22, 2008  2:34PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For the record, this thread has single-handedly made me start reading through the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145637/#Comment_145637" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-23T06:59:11+00:00" title="May 23, 2008  6:59AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool, thanks Lukas.

Two players canceled at the last minute (removing Zoe and Gavis from play), so I only had to run for four people, which was much easier and more inside my comfort zone as a GM.  I think it showed.<br/><br/><b>The Summary</b><br/><br/><b>Scene 1 (Character):</b><br/>A flashback to the meeting of Volt and Morgan!  Volt and Morgan arrive (independently of one another) in the Kanissian city of Barang just in time to witness an attack by a monsterous beyonder (a huge bear with barbed, tentacle-like feelers in its mouth).  Upon defeating it, they are immediately surrounded by Kanissian soldiers and taken in for questioning, while the beyonder is carted up and carried away.  As it is being removed, Volt notices that the bear has several pneumatic implants that look like Kanissian technology.<br/><br/>They were brought to an interrogation room, where their hands were chained to the floor and their Soulbound Weapons placed on a table just out of reach.  As they were being interrogated, Volt mentions that he hoped the Kanissians had done a better job of restraining the beyonder this time.  At that very moment, it busted through the wall, crushing their interrogator and hitting the table in just such a way that their weapons slid off of it and into their laps.  They glanced at each other, exchanged quick introductions, and broke their chains to leap into the fray again.<br/><br/><b>Scene 2 (Character):</b><br/>A flashback to the meeting of Keru Koteru and Ton!  Ton is in a prisoner wagon, pondering how he game to be here after being lost by his commanding officer on a bad hand of poker.  Meanwhile, Ton sneaks up on the caravan in order to steal the weapons and money in one of the wagons.<br/><br/>This scene was amazing, because the two players kept swapping points of view back and forth, conveying how their characters were totally missing one another's points and perspectives, while completely supporting each others' narrations as players.  Keru saw Ton as a fellow Freedom Fighter, while Ton saw Keru as a convenient helper for his schemes.  In the end, Keru blows up the wrong wagon, robbing Ton of his prize, and the two of them flee into the night.<br/><br/><b>Scene 3 (Character):</b><br/>Back to the present!  While traveling towards the clouded city, the group comes upon Morgan, whom they had sent ahead earlier to scout.  She has discovered the remains of a fight.  A wagon of some sort was attacked on the road while heading towards the clouded city in the southwest.  When it was done, one group went east, leaving a trail of blood.  One group went west, leaving a trail of slime.  Both groups were dragging something with them.  After some deliberation, they split into three groups: Ton and Keru go east, Volt and Morgan go west, and Zoe and Gavis (the absent players' characters) continued towards the clouded city to scout ahead.<br/><br/><b>Scene 4 (Conflict):</b><br/>For this scene, I ran two fights in two separate locations as one conflict, and it worked out really well.  Morgan and Volt discovered a swamp filled with <a href="http://www.ffcompendium.com/EspMon/marlboro10.jpg" rel="nofollow">Marlboros</a> while Keru and Ton found a cave guarded by Kanissian soldiers.<br/><br/>We made heavy use of Goals/Achievements with both groups, and most of them came as player suggestions, which made me really happy.  Ton and Keru had a "Get past the guards at the entrance without them setting off an alarm" Goal, which led to some interesting Maneuvers back and forth before they accomplished it.  As the conflicts went on and both groups achieved the goals of "Rescue the Rachni children in the carriers" (the objects that they'd seen being drug by the two groups) we even added "Escape from the fight" goals to the board.  As Hans put it at the end of the game, "I really enjoy the use of goals to circumvent other parts of the system.  It almost feels like if you're going at things using just the straight maneuver/strike conflict mechanics, then you're completely missing the point."  I'll be surprised if any of our future conflicts go all the way to full wounds on either side, unless beating/killing the opponent is the central goal of the conflict to begin with.<br/><br/>Near the end of the conflict, Ton tackled Doctor Romero Griffeth (the Kannissian scientist seeking to use the lifeforce of the special Rachni children to power his superweapon and whose last name is a deliberate play on yours, Christian) and rifled through his pockets before the Doctor escaped, taking his holo-ID and a few choice objects.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149393">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/amnesiack" title="amnesiack"><img alt="amnesiack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1012/830711303_f5d26761f6_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/amnesiack">amnesiack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149393/#Comment_149393" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-10T14:41:46+00:00" title="June 10, 2008  2:41PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 10, 2008 2:42PM by amnesiack.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Scene 5 (Character):</b><br/>The two groups meet back up, carrying the Rachni children that they rescued.  Ton shows the Doctor's ID to everyone, and Keru realizes that Dr. Griffeth may be able to help with the disease back in his village.  He turns to run back to the cave just in time to see a massive fireball burst forth from within, collapsing the cave.  Dejected, Keru despairs at saving his sister, but Ton, while scouting the area, finds tracks leading away from the cave and realizes that some of the soliders and/or the doctor survived the blast!  The tracks lead towards the clouded city, and our heroes set off in pursuit.<br/><br/>The End!<br/><br/><b>General Thoughts and Observations:</b><br/>Awesome Tokens were flying fast and furious this session, as people realized that the rewards for dropping three Action Dice into a Maneuver generally outweighed the rewards of playing it safe and hoarding the dice.  I love how the combination of Tokens and Charge dice build up to a "Limit Break" type of devastating action flurry near the end of a conflict.<br/><br/>Traits also saw heavy use.  One of the best was when Morgan made a huge flame Strike against the Marlboro's, achieving 9 successes on 11 dice.  The Marlboros had two wounds left and a defense of 4, leaving her one success short of a killing blow!  She unchecked "When in doubt, violence is the answer" and rerolled her two remaining dice, getting that last success and ending the battle.  The players love how Traits work, especially the fact that you just re-roll failures, rather than all the dice, leading to cool situations like the above.<br/><br/>The players mentioned that it still sometimes seems weird to not just be able to flat-out do something in a conflict (such as having to build up dice through maneuvers before they could achieve the goal of sneaking into the cave without setting off an alarm).  I'm not sure if that's just an immutable feature of the system or if I'm just not quite running it correctly.  Overall, though, it's working well for us.<br/><br/>I decided to introduce the optional Item mechanics at the end of this session (though not the corresponding crafting mechanics).  As a reward for the Marlboro/Dr. Griffeth conflict, I gave the characters the "Use Item I" power and two items: Cleansing Serum and a Grenade.  I've decided to go for the full-on video game logic of having the items exist in a pool that anyone can draw from, rather than making them divide the items among the characters.  We'll see how it works out.  I plan to continue doling out a few items per session as rewards for winning certain conflicts.<br/><br/>At this point, the only core mechanics of which we haven't made use are group maneuvers and group achievements.  In the next session, I'm probably going to try to introduce some high difficulty Goals to encourage the latter, but I'll probably leave use of group maneuvers to the players' discretions, since none of them have the Powers that make them especially useful.<br/><br/>One mistake I made was not allowing a player to use his Zap power to help him achieve a "Sabotage the Machines" Goal because it was a Strike Power rather than an Achievement Power.  It bothered me for the rest of the evening, so I went back and checked through the rules and found the bit about Strike Powers being usable for Achievements at the GM's discretion.  I sent an email to the players correcting my ruling from Wednesday, and I'll be on the lookout for opportunities for players to use any and all of their powers in pursuit of Achievements in future games.<br/><br/>The current plan has us playing Anima Prime for two more sessions, but I'm in no rush to end the game, so I may extend it to three, depending on how quickly things progress.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149396">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/amnesiack" title="amnesiack"><img alt="amnesiack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1012/830711303_f5d26761f6_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/amnesiack">amnesiack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149396/#Comment_149396" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-10T14:47:13+00:00" title="June 10, 2008  2:47PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 10, 2008 2:47PM by amnesiack.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh yeah, and best conversation of the evening:<br/><br/><b>Keru:</b> We have to go back!

Some possibilities that came up were trading them in for other dice with a much poorer ratio than a Power provides, such as 2 charge dice for one Strike Die or Action Die.

Also, they can do plenty of things within their maneuvers, depending on what type of adversity they're facing.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: amnesiack</cite>It almost feels like if you're going at things using just the straight maneuver/strike conflict mechanics, then you're completely missing the point.</blockquote>\nThe straight stuff is there for when you want something to fall back on, in my mind.

How are those working for you?</blockquote>\nAh, I'm glad you asked about that.  My players have pretty varying levels of skill at describing actiony things and making them sound cool, so even if I'm judging solely based on what people are saying and not on who's saying it, the higher dice rewards start to feel uncomfortably like favoritism over time.  Because of that, I've sort of weighted the scale towards the high end for everyone.<br/><br/>I've yet to give out a 1 die Maneuver.  In theory, if someone said something like "I try to hit him" and left it at that, I would hand out 1 die, but I don't see that happening.  Most Maneuvers, if the players put effort into it, get 3 dice.  If a player repeats a past Maneuver without much variation to the description, then it usually drops to 2 dice.  I watch for the reactions of other players and if someone describes something that visibly excites one or more other players or makes several people laugh or shout out, then that Maneuver gets 4 dice.<br/><br/>In a longer game, I would be tempted to just use Competency for the PCs instead, mixing Competency gains with Power gains as rewards over time, and let players get their extra dice from each other.\n<blockquote>Did they hit their passions in the conflict? Do they inform their character actions in the scenes, too, or are they usually forgotten when they don't provide charge dice?</blockquote>\nThe only character's Passion that has gotten activated yet is Morgan's Anger.  I think that's my fault for not making the opposition stronger and meaner, though, since I have mostly Vengeance and Compassion to work with, which require some of the characters to get beat down before they do anything.  The players are playing to them quite nicely, though, which I think comes more out of them picking a Passion that was as close to their character's personality as possible and then just playing the character, rather than from them looking at the Passion and saying, "Oh yeah, I should act like <i>this</i>."\n<blockquote>Also, do you ever create your own adversity powers? I need to add some stuff to the rules, examples and such. I made a power that hit all of the PCs with one roll, for example. Bosses get to do those kinds of things.</blockquote>\nA little bit.  Mostly, they're combinations of existing powers, rather than brand new things.  For instance, I gave the Marlboro's the classic "Bad Breath" attack (Cost: 5 Charge Dice.  Target loses 2 Action Dice and gains the Poison and Blind conditions).  There are a couple of bigger, "boss battle" type conflicts that will probably happen in the next session or two, and I will likely use some in those, though I'm not completely sure what they will be yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149908/#Comment_149908" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T21:35:15+00:00" title="June 11, 2008  9:35PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 12, 2008 6:26AM by Christian_Griffen.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: amnesiack</cite>In a longer game, I would be tempted to just use Competency for the PCs instead</blockquote>\nSee... I want to reward creativity and allow PCs to step up and fight off bigger foes than they usually could.  That doesn't work with a flat competence, only with varying dice.*  But I get the same negative feeling from it, and I end up just giving everyone 3 dice most of the time, just like you (1 die really isn't there to be handed out, just as a deterrent, so to speak).<br/><br/>So here's the alternative I want to explore.  I'd like your thoughts on it. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>There's competence for the character group.  Every conflict, it starts at 1.  Whenever a PC does a very cool maneuver, or at the end of a great round (I haven't decided on that yet), the GM can kick that up by 1 point, to a maximum of 5.  That also allows rising intensity in conflicts, as the PCs gain more dice as the conflict goes on.  It rewards players for good input and focus, but the whole group benefits because the one competence rating counts for all of them, which is more in the spirit of Anima Prime.<br/><br/>* ETA: Not entirely true due to goals, actually.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149966/#Comment_149966" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T06:28:55+00:00" title="June 12, 2008  6:28AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Filip,<br/><br/>I could put something optional in there, but I'm not sure it would fit with the rest.  The idea behind AP is to keep bookkeeping to a minimum.   In addition, the budgeting in BH is part of the challenge-based focus of choosing your own difficulty.  I'll have to see how that would fit into AP, which is not supposed to be as challenging and which doesn't have room for reward points.

One of Anima Prime's strong suits is encouraging the players to work together, so anything that furthers that is cool in my book.  What would be considered "a great round" if you went that route?<br/><br/>Ooooh, that just made me think of another possibility.  What do you think about this as another alternative:<br/><br/>Use either base Competency or the "combo" alternative outlined in the book (Competency with the GM able to give 1 die like anyone else) for the group (as you outline above).  Then, increase the Competency rating based on how many Action dice the players give to each other to assist in Maneuvers.  I see two basic methods.<br/><br/>1) For every X number of Action dice given in total among the players, Competency increases by 1, up to a maximum of Y.  X would probably vary based on the number of players at the table.<br/><br/>2) For every X number of Action dice that a single player gives to other players, Competency increases by 1, and each player can only increase Competency by 1 in a given Conflict.<br/><br/>The upside is that it gives even more incentive to the players tossing dice to each other (which happens already at my table, but it could happen more!).  The downside is that players could potentially inflate the Competency rating without actually caring that much about the Maneuvers that they're boosting with their Action dice.  Another nice thing about it, though, is that as their Action Pools start getting low, they don't have to spend as much on their own actions because their Competence is higher.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150506/#Comment_150506" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T11:20:35+00:00" title="June 13, 2008 11:20AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alright, I've thought about this since you posted it.  I like the basic idea, but I think it's a little too involved, what with having to figure out how many players there are, what to do when players combine maneuvers, what to do when some of the players have no more action dice left, needing a chart/formula for the number of dice needed until Group Competence goes up, etc.  I really want to keep things as simple as possible.<br/><br/>Right now, I think I'll handle it thusly:<br/><br/>1. Start with Group Competence 1 (unless the GM figures the characters have some story advantage, it's a follow-up conflict, etc.)<br/><br/>2. The GM gets to toss in one die to a player's maneuver like everyone else, except that it doesn't come out of her Action Pools.<br/><br/>3. On the GM's turn, the GM can turn up the Group Competence by 1.  If the GM has given one or more dice to maneuvers during the round, she should do this.  If not, it can still be done, per discretion.<br/><br/>This rewards good maneuvers, keeps the Group Competence from going up too quickly, is independent of the number of players, and still gives the GM room to reward more than one maneuver per turn.<br/><br/>As a side note, I'm thinking of suggesting that, for initiative/turn order purposes, the players act in one batch and the GM's adversity in a separate one, and that the players can figure out each round who goes in which order.  That'd further streamline the flow and allow easier use of combined maneuvers, super combo strikes, and so on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/amnesiack" title="amnesiack"><img alt="amnesiack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1012/830711303_f5d26761f6_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/amnesiack">amnesiack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150537/#Comment_150537" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T12:30:10+00:00" title="June 13, 2008 12:30PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 13, 2008 12:35PM by amnesiack.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I really want to keep things as simple as possible.</blockquote> I can see that.

Once all the players have gone, then the NPCs act in whatever order I want (which may change from round to round).

We had a small-scale fight against some throwaway foes, and an epically large boss fight.  It worked swimmingly.<br/><br/>- No-one ever had to stop and think "how do I narrate something cooler than last time, because I need to grub for dice from the GM".  As a result, things flowed much, much faster, with greatly reduced narration fatigue.<br/>- The early portion of fights are strange, because your foes have so many more dice than you... but you have AP to sling around, at least for a while.<br/>- The steady buildup of Group Competence reminds me of FFVII-style limit-break meters.  This is a good thing.<br/>- By the time your AP is completely empty, you've got enough group competence to keep combat from sputtering out.  You end up alternating between refresh/catch-breath actions and Really Big Attack actions, which feels different from the skirmish-oriented smaller-die-pool things that you do earlier in the fight.<br/>- Speaking of Maneuver Boost, some of the powers may require rebalancing in a world where even the most basic maneuever gives six dice (more likely nine, as you burn two APs from a refresh, and your resident Eidolon Summoner feeds you extra APs from his stupidly deep pool).  I felt it gave me an extraordinary efficiency gain compared to characters without it, and I wouldn't object to dialing it back to +1 instead of +2.<br/>- Also, with five competence dice, is it possible to start with a large AP pool, throw an eight die manuever, get an awesome token, immediately spend the token for another eight-die manuever, get another awesome token, do it a third time, use some of the accumulated charge dice to cast Refresh, and end the turn down five APs, with a huge charge pool built, and with +4 AP to several party members?  Then the next party member does the same thing, and everyone ends the turn at or near full-APs with an enormous strike pool built up.  Then the next turn everyone does a mondo-huge combined strike, and kills pretty much any boss in two rounds.  Just a thought.<br/><br/>Other than the new Group-Confidence rules, Lukas also gave us all the "Refresh" power as a freebie, although we didn't use it much, to our detriment.  I think there's an interesting tradeoff between the more expensive Refresh and the less-expensive Catch Your Breath (which we did use a lot.)<br/><br/>Also, as a house-rule, enemies don't earn "Awesome Tokens".  Instead, the tokens they earn are called "Most Non-Triumphant Tokens."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155072">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155072/#Comment_155072" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-06T07:47:40+00:00" title="July  6, 2008  7:47AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Hans!

Refresh really shines when a conflict is close. Also: when someone's poisoned and you don't have Restore, it allows them to make stronger or more maneuvers before they run out of AP again.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hans Andersen</cite>your resident Eidolon Summoner feeds you extra APs from his stupidly deep pool</blockquote>\nI'd like to hear more about this one <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Also: how's your usage of goals going?

So, David uses Keru's own pool like a big bucket of fan mail, rewarding the other players' cool narration left and right, and by extension helping all the other players get Awesome Tokens on a very, very regular basis.  At least I think that's what's going on, David explained it sort of all at once, and I'm not sure I caught all the subtleties.<br/><br/>One of the players (Andy, playing Volt Codec) really embraced the goal-setting this time, and was very enthused about it.  The rest of us?  Notsomuch.  This was our first big dangerous fight, and we fell pretty heavily into trying to manage our pools and our powers for the best advantage, purely within the bounds of the combat system.<br/><br/>Lukas gave us a big help halfway through the fight by picking up on our narrations and translating them into goals. In this case, Glacier (12' tall suit of ice-themed power armored villain) had the power that granted him a charge die every turn, and Lukas described his big shoulder-mounted capacitors thrumming with energy.  A player did a narration that included a direct attack against the capacitors, and Lukas responded by writing two new Goals - "Destroy the capacitors - 4 - stop his recharge" and "Shatter his armor - 6 - reduce defense by 2".  Which we promptly did.  Although it would have been cooler if we had proposed goals ourselves.<br/><br/>Re: goals, I'm feeling a tension between whether goals should be task-level, or conflict-level.  This same fight had goals to "Destroy the capacitors", which fed back into the combat system, and also "Take Doctor Whatshisface Out Of The Fight And Hold Him Hostage", which explicitly subverted the combat system.  Are both intended to be equally valid?  What would have happened if we won the "Take Doc Hostage" goal but then all been taken out of the fight?  Would the accomplished goal still stand?<br/><br/>Finally, one other rules-tweak we did that bears mentioning - One character got taken out of the fight right around the point where we all hit Competency 5.  His strike pools were pretty much full, he was ready to rock, he even had an Awesome Token in his back pocket... and he was left flat on the floor.  Lukas ruled that he could use his token to spend a turn getting back on his feet.  In retrospect, I think it would have been more satisfying if one of us had declared this as a Goal - "Reboot Volt's CPU - n - Bring him back to 1 health" - leaving the Awesome Token still in play for Andy to use as a furious comeback attack.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155198">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/amnesiack" title="amnesiack"><img alt="amnesiack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1012/830711303_f5d26761f6_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/amnesiack">amnesiack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155198/#Comment_155198" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-07T08:40:36+00:00" title="July  7, 2008  8:40AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I take the weekend to do my write-up, and Hans beats me to it!<br/><br/>We had to cancel a session, due to me being sick, so there was a four-week gap between the last session I wrote about and the next one, which took place last Wednesday.  Once again, we had just four players (the same four as last time), and it ran really smoothly.  As Hans mentioned, we tried out both the new conflict rules (players go first and pick their action order and slowly-increasing Competence) and both seemed to work really well.<br/><br/><b>Quote of the Night</b><br/>Keru Koteru: The Blade's Remorse is not for giving "shield rides!"
