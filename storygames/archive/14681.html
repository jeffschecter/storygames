Would it help to mark those on the character sheet, along with some check boxes?<br/><br/>It's like, Van the Deadly (Held PC) goes to the Iron Fangs (Faction) for a Deal scene.  What motivation is there for Van to actually hold up his end of the Deal?  The roll's over, the improvement either happened or it didn't.  So I'm thinking:<br/>Van's player can establish that he's accomplished his end of the Deal later, in another scene perhaps.  He can give someone a Negative Condition, if that was the Deal, or he can use a Success to "establish a fact."<br/>-or-<br/>Another player can grab the Iron Fangs and push a Face Off with Van for squelching.<br/><br/>So maybe something like<br/><br/>Accomplished                             Deals                                        Burned<br/> [  ]                ___________________________________________    [  ]<br/> [  ]                ___________________________________________    [  ]<br/> [  ]                ___________________________________________    [  ]<br/><br/><br/>2) Face-Off scenes.<br/><br/>What if both controller and player are happy just getting what they want, and not rolling the dice?  Is there a kharmic strike option?  I mean, it's not in the mechanics as written, I don't think, but have you been tempted?  Would it spoil the tone?<br/><br/>Or maybe it's a sign that the stakes have been framed poorly?  Like, "if they're framed correctly, both sides will really fight hard."  Or "if you're willing to give in to your opponent's stakes, they aren't high enough" ?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333797">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333797/#Comment_333797" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-10T20:36:15+00:00" title="July 10, 2011  8:36PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Re: 2 -<br/><br/>Page 27: Colour|No Conflicts<br/><br/>Paraphrased: If you don't get to that "pivotal" conflict moment, then it's just a "colour" scene, no winners, no losers, and each side just picks one outcome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333798/#Comment_333798" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-10T20:44:35+00:00" title="July 10, 2011  8:44PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Re: 1 -<br/><br/>I don't know that it needs mechanics.  Sure, the PC already got his roll, but the Faction already got its INF.  It can just be assumed that the PC accomplished his end of the deal, unless it involves screwing with another PC directly, somebody frames the PC into the mission in media res, or its established in the fiction that the PC blew it off.  And in that case, if the PC doesn't uphold his end of the deal, it just makes it easier for somebody to send the Faction after the PC for Face-Off, which, really, is what you want.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333839/#Comment_333839" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-11T07:45:06+00:00" title="July 11, 2011  7:45AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ludanto</cite>..., and each side just picks one outcome.</blockquote>\nI missed that pivotal fragment.

All I can think is to suggest that maybe you can push for the next Controller to frame up the mission in the next scene.  If everybody agrees that auto-complete is boring, he or she probably won't mind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
