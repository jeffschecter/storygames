I've been aching to find a name for the "zombie that isn't a zombie" genre, and I'm now settling on "Horde Movie" or "Horde Story."<br/><br/>There are variations on The Horde, like that they can make you one of them in the case of Zombies, Pod People or Communists, but it's always about the faceless Horde.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_83991">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83991/#Comment_83991" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-30T07:28:55+00:00" title="July 30, 2007  7:28AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason:  Yeah ... sorry.

In the absence of a zombie lord (in which case you'd be back to a traditional "evil necromancer" plot), zombies become a plot device and a restricting factor rather than the threat itself. The threat always comes from somewhere else - the military/government complex, the Umbrella Corporation's operatives, other survivors, lack of supplies, yourself and your fear.<br><br>As such, as has been phrased here in many different ways, zombies become the background and the characters provide the contrast. Thus, you can use it as a mashup ingredient to great effect, much like Joss Whedon added a sprinkle of sci-fi to his western and made Firefly.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_84124">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D" title="Thomas D"><img alt="Thomas D" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://landfill.thesnakefarm.com/images/misc/idescols.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D">Thomas D</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84124/#Comment_84124" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-30T12:56:38+00:00" title="July 30, 2007 12:56PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here we go:<br/><br/>Nameless hordes are a lens in which a "hero opposing masses of meaningless drones" character comes into sharp focus.

It's not clear if people will run a social campaign, or a dungeon crawl, or missions for Mr. Johnson. Adding "mindless" hordes to the WORLD (regardless of mechanics) provides an enemy that all people can agree is bad. While zombies can offer what Jason is saying (and wow, I wish they would), most companies don't strive for this.<br/><br/>It's not a slight on their part. But it's a convenient out. It's an easy way to make bad guys that any GM can drop into the game world. And I can name 10 games right now where they were added as an after-thought.<br/><br/>28 Days Later did an incredible job of reinventing the fear of zombies in what Danny Boyle calls, "the banality of modern life."<br/><br/>And I would love to see more games where "mutants" and "hordes" either take on more personality or more impact on the world around them.

Even the vile thief doesn't want to see the town they reside in completely eradicated by the walking death. The great thing about zombies also, is that for the players themselves, the fear that they encompass can really get to the players in a well orchestrated suspenseful session.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've always liked them, that's why I ran a campaign for a year and a half, which came to be known as the Armies of the Undead. For months on end they never saw light or another breathing creature, and of course once light was in their grasp, an unfortunate event put the countryside under eternal darkness.
