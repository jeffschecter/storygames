People here have a tendency to make seemingly innocuous remarks during their otherwise admirably contentious posts, such as the following:<br/><br/><i>I really like games!<br/>The GM should be a good storyteller.<br/>D&amp;D is sometimes fun, but sometimes not-fun.<br/>It's good sometimes to break in the middle of a gamng session for snacks.<br/>Girls are neat!<br/></i><br/><br/>Well, nice try people. I know that you're all speaking a code here, and that the statements you are <i>really</i> making via these bland pronouncements are in fact a grotesque parade of heinous lies. So let's take of the freaking gloves, already! Tell me all of the puerile nonsense that you truly believe, and then maybe we can finally get down to a substantive discussion.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248611">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248611/#Comment_248611" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-26T13:35:09+00:00" title="December 26, 2009  1:35PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I believe that children are the future...teach them well and let them lead the way...show them all the beauty you possess inside...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_248613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248613/#Comment_248613" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-26T13:43:22+00:00" title="December 26, 2009  1:43PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alright, Mark is right.<br/><br/>I'll say it.<br/><br/><i>I am having more fun than you.</i><br/><br/>There, I said it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248619">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248619/#Comment_248619" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-26T14:13:47+00:00" title="December 26, 2009  2:13PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Girls aren't always neat.

know better ways to play,<br/>Now it is the dawn of a new indie day. <br/><br/>Then comes Saint Vincent with his Dogs<br/>And all his followers, we'll call them hogs,<br/>To give us wisdom like "say yes or roll the dice" <br/>All to try to make our games be nice.<br/>But in the end we instead take them as laws<br/>And polish the turds despite manifest flaws<br/>And grow insular and hating those outside<br/>Who we mock and belittle and deride.<br/>(In truth they deserve it, stupid gets <br/>Because they play games with unicorn pets.)<br/><br/>Soon after we get fellows like Graham and Ben<br/>Who are snide and clever and harsh all the Zen<br/>And then come folks like Matt and Brand<br/>Who just love to give the forum the back of their hand<br/>We get follows like Andy and Judd<br/>Who seem to nice to get down in the mud<br/>And endless fellows like Matthijs and Eero <br/>Who despited being Vikings are really quite mellow<br/>And who can forget the Jeffs and Jakes and

            Just to disagree with Judd, who I <i>do</i> have more fun than, I am going to list my unreasonably honest responses. I've listed some problems, and some things I can do about it (if I can):<br/><br/>- I think people who don't state things as opinions, when in fact they are opinions, are rude, selfish, and probably not people I want to spend time with.<br/>- I think people in the geek community are simultaneously too tolerant of unsociable behavior, and full of an overinflated, Ayn-Randian sense of self-opinion. I need to learn that I can't change that, and just figure out who I can be friendly with.<br/>- I think there are too many people who try to discourage people who have a passion to create roleplaying games. Too often I hear people's enthusiasm crushed, rudely and callously. In my opinion, people who do this are (in decreasing order of charitableness): mistakenly believing they're helping, overly-fussy about some kind of indie "brand," stupid, or are venally or pathologically worried about their games or reputations being damaged by association with this "dummy" who's asking for help. Perhaps some combination of these, I don't know. And, yes, the (<b>edit</b>) <b>stupid</b> are not as bad as the self-interested, in my opinion.<br/>- - This is not to discount people who give others genuinely helpful advice on how to use/channel their enthusiasm for game publishing in a helpful way. There is here, and elsewhere, a genuine ethic of frankness, honesty, mutualism, and genuine desire to stand behind someone with passion. Ron Edwards is, as I understand it, responsible for founding that community. For that, I am forever indebtted to him. He (and Judd Karlman) brought me back to something I loved and had thought lost.<br/>- - - Incidentally, the thing I can do about this first observation? Be like Ron and Judd (and Emily and Eppy and John and Luke and Joshua and Vincent and a far longer list of people), people who have that spirit and show it often, and eloquently.<br/>- Too many of us are inconsiderate with one another. I, for example, interrupt people way too often. Yeah, I have biological excuses, but fuck that. I can be better than that. And I keep trying.<br/><br/>- Finally, if you present a problem, present a solution or save it for your therapist, romantic partner, or close friend.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_248737">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248737/#Comment_248737" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-27T15:04:30+00:00" title="December 27, 2009  3:04PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Johnstone</cite>I believe that Judd is having more fun than me.

Once enough people let it be known that there are tangible, intrageek consequences for their para-fascism and rape jokes, that will change.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_248778">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248778/#Comment_248778" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-27T23:50:47+00:00" title="December 27, 2009 11:50PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zac in Davis</cite>I am having more fun than trad gamers!

Both groups don't see anything wrong with what they're doing, but at least my D&amp;D cronies weren't in fucking <i>denial.</i><br/><br/>I don't like playing sci-fi games. Apocolypse World is the exception, and I've played sci-fi Mist-Robed Gate, but that doesn't count. If a game is <i>about</i> hovercrafts and alien lifeforms and Brave New World, I am bored to tears. The turn towards increasingly impressive Essence technology in Exalted is a big part of what put me off.<br/><br/>And the most controversial thing of all: One of the most cringe-worthy things I can think of is when I'm with a bunch of my friends at an unexpected gathering, we're having an awesome conversation or whatever, and someone's like "Who wants to play a one-shot of Dogs?"  I love you guys, love roleplaying with you guys when we get together for just that, but sometimes I'd vastly prefer playing a board or card game, joking around, and having an actual conversation. Call me crazy, but there you go. (We just had such a night a week or so ago which was a fucking blast.)

You may very well have had more fun and more provocation of thought than me. <br/>All I know is that AD&amp;D was too complicated, and then I got stuck behind the bus that is Old World of Darkness for about six years.

But then; you are one of many that have had their share of frustration with their role-playing games. <br/><br/>A lot of players have had great initial experiences with<i> D&amp;D</i> and other of the oldies, but when they have sought real developments and flexibility in their games, they have been let down by them. The typical gamer stop playing around 17-18, or continue only to pass time with their friends, not really into the gaming side of it anymore (no point in investing too much in a media which only delivers simplistic and juvenile stories).<br/><br/>- 0 -<br/><br/>Myself,<br/>I came into role-playing games as a grown up, and did not find D&amp;D very interesting, so I quickly dismissed it. But a friend rescued me, and included me in a campaign run with his homebrew, and from that point on I was sold.<br/><br/>I quickly proceeded to hammer out my own games, and within three years made the poetic fable rpg <i>Muu </i>(still classical; with a leader and players) and a series of 5 eyeopening experimental rp-games with my friend Jon (the <i>Impro</i>-series). That was around 1990.<br/><br/>So when the World of Darkness came along, we were way ahead, and did not quite see the point in a classical game that only "changed" on the surface. I had no revelation with WoD, but went on with my own games and my own agendas. I rounded the century by publishing my fantasy-rpg <i>Fabula </i> (1999). Since then I have continued to develop <i>Fabula</i>, and have had approximately 2000-2500 game-sessions with it, mostly as a professional GM.<br/><br/>The more modern games started to be part of my design-work in 1993, and have continued to be, with a definitive break-through when my friend Magnus made <i>Until we sink ...</i> some years back. That was a revelation for me, in my work with modern role-playing games.<br/><br/>- 0 -<br/><br/>I believe this makes me an oddity as a gamer. And it has made me into a gamer with high expectations of what to get from my games. I've invested a great deal of time in getting what I want; tough stories that makes the game-groups feel something "real". Even my classical games aim for such stories.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_248869">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248869/#Comment_248869" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-28T11:02:41+00:00" title="December 28, 2009 11:02AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 28, 2009 11:03AM by noclue.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I believe in the soul, the cock, the pussy, the small of a woman's back, the hanging curve ball, high fiber, good scotch, that the novels of Susan Sontag are self-indulgent, overrated crap.
