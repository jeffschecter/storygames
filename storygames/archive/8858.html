(I won't talk details here, you can find them in the old tread if you want to better know what I'm talking about).<br/><br/>To make it short, I need to maintain a certain level of deep tactical combat in my game, because I have player who's not quite that much into story. (You could say he's a gamist in my narrativist game).<br/><br/>When using d20modern, it was fairly easy to keep everybody happy. I'm pretty new to STing and could really use some advice on how to make combat more tactically satisfying in nWod. (The few times I've run nWoD I find that combat can be cruder and more stressful, which I love but think my player wouldn't quite enjoy).</span><br/><br/><span style="color: purple;">Please note: I'm not looking for advice on what other systems to use, I'm sticking with nWod for at least 3 sessions right now, thanks n_n.</span> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196014">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196014/#Comment_196014" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-06T18:44:00+00:00" title="March  6, 2009  6:44PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Omar,<br/><br/>I've never played nWoD, so I won't have anything useful to suggest.

He says he likes solving myseries, so that's a hint. The point is that he needs to be challenged as a player, to be able to make decisions that matter. It seems to me that those decisions can be of many different types:<br/><br/>* "I need to Flank my opponent so I can use my Surprise Blow effect, which will trigger Knockback, thus preventing that other dude to reach our vulnerable healer." This sort of tactical mechanics stuff is not likely to be found in WoD. Or, when it does, it will likely break the game.<br/>* "If we attack from the east, we can use the hills to our advantage, and you two guys can hide behind those bushes to sneak in while we occupy the guards." This sort of planning can be used in most traditional systems, including WoD. However, depending on hardcore-ness, the player might get frustrated at the amount of GM arbitrary decisions his plan depends on.<br/>* "Alright, the Prince won't support our cause, but Valerus will. However, Valerus will not openly go against the Prince. We need to either find a way to convince the Prince (maybe some blackmailing regarding his ties to the Brotherhood), or get rif of him altogether. The latter seems unfeasable, so let's try to find some dirt on him." This sort of stuff is what a lot of Vampire play is all about, so the WoD system ought to have no problems with is (though I'm not certain), and if you make sure to do this instead of railroading adventures that are all preplanned, you can likely tap into both his "social situations" and problem solving sockets.<br/>* "Hang on. The murderer entered through the window, right? So how come the vase over by the door is toppled? The victim was by the window, and there are no other signs of struggle, so what was the murderer doing by the door?" Yeah, this is the mystery solving stuff. It requires a lot of planning on your part, since any inconsistencies in the setup can ruin the process.<br/>* "Hm, this letter seems to be written in some sort of code." You can insert problem solving straight into the fiction and let the players handle it as players. Just make sure you have a contingency plan for what to do if they can't solve it. Maybe the caracters can solve it even if the players can't, but they lose the experience points they'd have recieved if they had figured it out by themselves.<br/>* "Alright. We only have 20 gold pieces to work with, here. Are you sure we need to buy the grappling hook? If we can get in without it, we can spend that money on hiring an extra mercenary for the distraction, instead." Resource management is a good way to introduce gamey challenges. Give the characters a very finite resource (money, soldiers, magic runes, what have you) and force them to use them sparingly. If they use up too many at one point, they'll have a very difficult time at some other point.<br/>* "Well, we could attack the Huge Monster straight away, while we're rested. Or we could attack the Little Monster first. If we go with the Little Monster, we risk being injured and tired when we face the Huge Monster, but we might find some valuable loot there that will help us. I know there are some great items on the GM's Loot Table, but if we roll low, we'll just get some gold." This is risk management, and it can be well used in combination with resource management. The simplest case is to get them to choose between a low-risk low-reward path and a high-risk high-reward one. Just make sure the players have the ability to accurately gauge the likelihood for success and failure, and that the rewards are clear. If a lot is dependent on arbitrary GM decisions, the tactical choices will be moot.<br/><br/>So there are lots of ways to implement problem solving in a game without resorting to the mechanics, but it's not always simple. The most important thing to keep in mind is to not let the arbitrary decisions influence their plans too much. If their plan to persuade the Prince to back off is wholly dependent on how you play the Prince, it'll be annoying. But if they get a Persuade roll, where they can gauge the chances of success, then it's no problem.<br/><br/>Hope that helps.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_196144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Omar_Ramirez" title="Omar_Ramirez"><img alt="Omar_Ramirez" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/370/nVR0Z4SVM1FWT.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Omar_Ramirez">Omar_Ramirez</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196144/#Comment_196144" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-07T20:28:12+00:00" title="March  7, 2009  8:28PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<span style="color: darkblue;"><a href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">@Simon_Pettersson</a><br/><br/>It does help quite a lot, thank you! n_n.<br/><br/>I will take it all into consideration.</span> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MJ%20Harnish" title="MJ Harnish"><img alt="MJ Harnish" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MJ%20Harnish">MJ Harnish</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196155/#Comment_196155" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-08T00:48:40+00:00" title="March  8, 2009 12:48AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How many players do you have?  It may sound harsh but Spock's wisdom (<i>"the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few....or the one"</i>) is often the best advice when it comes to a single player who wants something completely different out of the game than the rest of the group. If everyone else is happy with the system then I would focus on what makes them happy and try to include some combat opportunities (tactical or not) to keep him interested. You're likely already supplying his 1st and 3rd priority and IMO it's unfair for him to expect you to cater the game to his desires and ignore the wishes of the rest of the group.

I'd paraphrase Vincent Baker's advice (geared towards 3.5 D&amp;D) on making combat more narrative... have 3-5 environmental things in every set-piece combat you run... they might be good for just hiding behind, or they might be good for a 1-3 dice bonus in the right circumstances if a player exploits them. So, you have a shootout in a warehouse, and you have crates all over the place (cover), but also a couple of fork-lifts (great cover, and a potential weapon) and a few (leaking) oil cannisters. If your player is really into tactical combat, all you have to do is describe these things, and he'll bite... and everything can be thought of in terms of 1-3 bonus dice. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat gives you a fair balance of tactical combat without bogging the rest of the group down in resource management or moving on a 5' square grid - which is presumably why you chose to switch systems in the first place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_196219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196219/#Comment_196219" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-09T00:42:53+00:00" title="March  9, 2009 12:42AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Re Christian and Guy: I'm not the player to judge it, but that doesn't sound anything like tactical combat to me.

I assume the players know this or figure it out. You can either pick those dice up or not. The choice, then, is "would you like more dice?" The correct answer to that question is "yes." In chess, every move has a set of costs, including opportunity cost, pace versus structure, and so on. Each decision require you to weigh costs and benefits against each other. I don't see that here, though. If the notion is to have those balancing costs, then sure. Without balancing costs, then it's just a new hoop to jump through from a tactical perspective. You talk until you get those dice, or you are making a tactical error. No middle ground.<br/><br/>Making use of your environment makes you more likely to win in real life, but it only makes the history books when seizing that advantage required a lot of difficulty elsewhere or required going against conventional wisdom. If you decide to not "secure the interior lines and bring superior force to bear" in an otherwise conventional battle, that's not interesting. It just means that you're not very competent. Good tactical games have interesting choices at their core, not a series of purely mandatory choices.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_196496">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196496/#Comment_196496" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-10T19:07:10+00:00" title="March 10, 2009  7:07PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, the bonus dice aren't limited in this approach.

For example, suppose the tactical-minded player has an action that can remove an enemy from combat outright (say, a mental domination attack) and another move that just deals damage. All things being equal, you'd rather use the one-hitter-quitter. Suppose the 3 terrain-based bonus dice can only apply to his damaging attack. Now the player needs to weigh an attack that's more powerful against an attack that's more likely to hit. That might work, provided you're very transparent and open about the nature of the trade-off.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_196505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196505/#Comment_196505" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-10T20:22:53+00:00" title="March 10, 2009  8:22PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Back int he oWoD days, there was this rather awesome "COMBAT!!!" book that had all sorts of nifty rules for weapons and tactics with the core of the (then) WoD system.

But I think the point still stands. There's a tradeoff in game design between having all options mechanically spelled out, and kicking everything to player judgment call. Either way you lose something. . .but I refuse to believe that "all options mechanically delineated" is the only way to get tactical play.<br/><br/>I'm not saying that this is your position, even; I don't know. But what it means is that there is some tactical oomph to be found in the rest of the spectrum, most especially in the middle. Take Beast Hunters again: another feature of the game is that there is a delineated list of options: you can Maneuver for Advantage, Strike to try and roll that Advantage in Damage, and do other stuff like Deny Resource, which is basically disarming an offensive or defensive ability. So turn by turn you've got tradeoffs in your choices: strike now or keep maneuvering for a better damage roll? Keep attacking, or take out that Armor so your attack will get through better? Or take out the weapon so you don't keep getting pounded? And so on.<br/><br/>But the framework is loose enough to accommodate a lot of creative ideas without needing a special rule for them, and this is vital to success. Keep going "uh, I knock the sword out of his hand, I guess?" an you'll probably get creamed. Do something clever like "I draw him out into a rash attack so his blade jams in the gear mechanism behind me" and the GM can offer you a big bonus for your effort. You can incorporate the environment, use props unconventionally, and so forth, while plugging it into an elegant framework that isn't just fiat.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm not sure how applicable this is to WoD, but I hope it was at least useful to consider.<br/><br/>peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_198236">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Millsy" title="Millsy"><img alt="Millsy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Millsy">Millsy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198236/#Comment_198236" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-22T10:53:22+00:00" title="March 22, 2009 10:53AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 22, 2009 10:54AM by Millsy.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Posted By: Simon_Pettersson&lt;/cite&gt;Re Christian and Guy: I'm not the player to judge it, but that doesn't sound anything like tactical combat to me. That's narrational combat. There are no important decisions, just some creative challenges. And while creative challenges are fun, it's a wholly different kind of fun from tactical fun. Creative challenges are Baron Munchaussen, tactical challenges are Chess.&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI take your point; I guess that creative challenges are what I personally tend to want from combat, rather than tactical challenges. I totally see how your tactical player might not grab this idea - however, you know him better than us. I recently played in a (first time through) Exalted game with a group of pretty hardcore battlemap-and-miniatures D&amp;D3.5; players. They took to the stunt system pretty well - granted, Exalted has lots more crunchy tactical decisions to hang one's hat on than nWoD, but it worked for them/us.<br/>\n<br/>\nCombat! is an obvious choice, but I'm not sure how well its options would work without the whole group going for them - as I recall, it had a funky reverse-initiative model (if you win initiative, you go last, but can interrupt anyone else's action) which could be too much of a faff for the rest of the group. I think Scion has an exalted-style tick system which might do the trick, though...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
