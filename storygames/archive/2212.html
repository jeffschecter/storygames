<p>So, I'm using PTA (1, if it matters) to give episode structure to a game using TPK's conflict system. This means that I need to set up a stage presence / fanmail / budget economy, and I'm a little confused about how that is going to work out here. TPK uses some kinda random generator for NPCs, which isn't okay - they need to come out of the budget somehow.</p>
<p>So, what I'm thinking is, there are five states of stage presence, corresponding to 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13 dice. Kuroko (corresponds to producer, the 'traditionally invisible' stage hands of Kabuki theater) is allowed to make 1 NPC corresponding to each state presence value, with traits and relationships like the random-generator chart in TPK, shifted so that 5 has values for those. This consumes his entire budget.</p>
<p>One fanmail coin (corresponding to stage presence 1) provides one d8 to the recipient. You're allowed to hand out up to three coins of fanmail per scene. They flow back into the budget as usual.</p>
<p>Once they're back in the budget, they allow kuroko to reuse NPCs from this episode or previous episodes, with expenditure of the appropriate amount of budget. The intention here is to keep the NPC cast as small as possible, and emphasize the interconnectedness of episodes. They're like several approaches to an entanglement of issues, rather than the "one episode, one issue" structure of TPK.</p>
<p>That sound like it works? Does anything look clearly broken, and can I improve anything?</p>
