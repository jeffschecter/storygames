Ideally, I want a game that meets the following requirements:\n<ul>\n<li>Capable of doing Science fiction with spaceships.</li>\n<li>Able to deliver an Iain Banks or Firefly-level mood rather than Flash Gordon or anime.<br/></li><li>Offering a range of possibilities like Traveler rather than a predetermined scenario like Lady Blackbird</li>\n<li>Able to deal with more than just fighting.</li>\n<li>Players don't die easily.</li>\n<li>Narrative</li>\n<li>Capable of serious play</li>\n<li>Two-player.</li>\n<li>Emergent play/GM'less.</li>\n<li>Rules light.</li>\n</ul>\nThe reason for the last three are:<br/><br/>a) I'd like to play it with my wife.<br/>b) Neither of us want to spend a lot of time in prep. Also we'd both like to play at the same time.<br/>c) We're getting too old to learn yet another huge set of rules.<br/><br/>There are a number of games that seem perfect, except they need someone to do a lot of prep work:\n<ul>\n<li>Fate</li>\n<li>Sorceror</li>\n<li>Dr Who</li>\n<li>Mortal Coil</li>\n</ul>\n<br/>And a number that seem close but not quite right:\n<ul>\n<li>Traveler: characters die too easily. The rules appear sim-based. Tech appears old-fashioned.</li>\n<li>3:16: Seems to be mostly about fighting.</li>\n<li>Cosmic Patrol: Pulpy</li>\n<li>Shock: Needs more players. Also, I can't make head nor tail of the rules.</li>\n<li>Universalis:  Seems a bit abstract, somehow. I've never played it, though.</li>\n</ul>\nI've found two that are absolutely perfect - just what I want - except they only handle one type of play:\n<ul>\n<li>The quiet year.</li>\n<li>Mars Colony.</li>\n</ul>\n<br/>None of this is set in stone, though. If I've got the wrong idea about something, or one of those games would actually be perfect for me, I'd love to hear about it.<br/><br/>At the moment, the nearest game I can find is Archipelago, which has worked well for us for fantasy so far. If nothing else is suggested I'm going to go with this, but I just thought I'd ask. Are there any really good rules-light GM'less science fiction games out there I'm missing?<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424936/#Comment_424936" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-28T18:37:11+00:00" title="November 28, 2013  6:37PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 28, 2013 6:42PM by Steve_Hickey.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, you might want to consider the new Firefly RPG from Margaret Weis Productions.

means you just need to note down your idea and then you can add as many details as you want, or stay simple, or anything in between.<br/>And it will be relevant to the game as a Tool in relation to what your PCs are doing.<br/><br/><br/><i>Able to deliver an Iain Banks or Firefly-level mood rather than Flash Gordon or anime.</i><br/>Check.<br/>That is up to you as the game offers very clear and powerful tools to define what the tone/mood/style of your game should be, and then to KEEP it that way.<br/>Also, the game assumes al PCs function as a united team with a common goal.<br/><br/><br/><i>Offering a range of possibilities like Traveler rather than a predetermined scenario like Lady Blackbird</i><br/>Check.<br/>There are clear and very simple rules to play in any

GM-<b>Full</b> one.<br/>That is because you almost never play in an Autor Stance or are otherwise allowed to act as Director/Narrator/GM.<br/>You play your own Character, and that is it.<br/>The game will ask for other input (bite sized chunks of it, very specific, very focussed) from time to time, a bit more in 2-Players games, a bit less in 3-4-5-Players games.<br/>But that is all.<br/>At any

Thank you all <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I intend to buy Firefly when it comes out even if it doesn't meet the GMless requirement. I'm a big fan of Leverage already.<br/><br/>I'm not personally convinced yet by Traveler (World) / Diaspora. There's something really peculiar about science fiction (and I say this as someone who writes a lot of it). Unlike fantasy, it's really easy for technology to become out of date. Last time I played Traveler, it assumed a future the eighties might have thought we would have. There was no social media, for example, and computers were bulky items. Even our group's insistence on head-cams, internet access and automatic recording caused the GM some confusion and had the potential of screwing up the scenario. I think it's best if a science fiction game that intends to be played across the decades doesn't hard-code tech levels into its rules.<br/>But, again, I may simply be misunderstanding Traveler. I'm certainly no expert.<br/><br/>I was a Kickstarter backer of Kingdom, and I intend to check out the two-player version. I think it might well be as much fun as the Quiet Year/Mars Colony, though like them it does seem to create a very singular type of experience.<br/><br/>I keep meaning to buy the mythic GM emulator - but I thought it only did the effort of running the game. Does it do prep work, too?<br/><br/>Dreamwake looks interesting. I'll check it out <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Lasers and Feelings looks great, too, though I believe it needs a GM?<br/><br/>I guess what I'd love is a game that produces a setting as easily as the Quiet Year but deals more with protagonist-characters, as well as being skinnable for wider situations. A set of cards that produces a haunted spaceship full of alien relics, for example. Then another set that produces a heist mission in a future corporation. And another that gives a trading mission full of complications. Maybe I just want GM-less Firefly! Although it would be nice to do post-singularity stuff, too.<br/><br/>Anyway, thanks for all the replies.

It has a nice risk-reward mechanic and the GM really only needs to be there for NPC purposes and such and to add an extra twist of danger here and there, things two dedicated players should be capable of doing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425003/#Comment_425003" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-30T03:12:49+00:00" title="November 30, 2013  3:12AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'm suggesting to you <a href="gdriv.es/unplayablegames" rel="nofollow"><b>Dreamwake</b></a> because...</blockquote>\nThe URL didn't work so I'm trying to repost it...<br/><a href="http://gdriv.es/unplayablegames/dreamwake.html" rel="nofollow">http://gdriv.es/unplayablegames/dreamwake.html</a><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425051">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425051/#Comment_425051" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-02T06:13:35+00:00" title="December  2, 2013  6:13AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Archipelago seems like it\u2019d work great especially if you\u2019ve already got experience with it.

You can't make any character you want. The last time I played, my first two characters died whilst being generated. The third came out with the skill "Cutlass," which just didn't feel very science-fiction-y.<br/><br/>I've got the Psion supplement, and it even has random rolls for losing your powers before you play the character.<br/><br/>2. Even if you could play any character, they seem awfully fragile. I've never gone a game of Traveler without the dice being fudged or someone dying rapidly. Maybe that's because I'm trying to play Firefly in a universe more like Apocalypse Now?<br/><br/>3. It has strange assumptions about technology. Computers are rare and heavy. Communications is limited. Social media non-existent. Unfortunately, while they were great assumptions for a future extrapolated from 1980, I'm not sure today's science fiction can do without technology at least at the level of our own.<br/><br/>Somehow, I keep coming back to Traveler. I feel I should love the system more than I do. It's hard-science-fiction, with variable technology levels and dozens of sourcebooks (many of which I have). I really, truly want to love it, but it seems to fall down each time I play it. I think I'm ultimately looking for a game with a different philosphy.<br/><br/>What I'd love is for there to be a two-player emergent game that produces science-fiction stories. Something like Shock:, but for two-players.<br/><br/><br/>As for the other suggestions:<br/><br/>Jason: I'm certainly going to play Archipelago again. It's one of the best story producing games I know <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>J_Walton: I have Microscope and I'll go take a look at it, but my understanding is that it's really about events, not characters. So it might be useful for playing out a science-fictional history, but not really for following a couple of protagonists.

Traveller is like Firefly without the heroics (but a lot of old games are like that, old school d&amp;d punished heroism too). But that's more mechanics than theme.<br/><br/>A group of well armed (even if it's just six shooters and and shotguns) could probably pull off a train robbery on some backwater world in Traveller; just don't expect the whole team to come home alive or uninjured.<br/><br/>I'm in the middle of a Traveller game at the moment that is actually pretty firefly-ish, but I think we're stretching that a bit more than the game expects to support. We've taken on threats we should NOT have been able to overcome through clever tactics, luck, a bit of BS and a bit of GM hand-waving.<br/><br/>(When attacking an enemy ship; if you take out their power plant don't board them, just wait till their air runs out!

I'm not looking for something that I can put into a novel, just something GM'less that neither of us has to prep in advance.<br/><br/>We'd like to come to the table and have the game deliver stuff to do while we play it, rather than someone having to draft it in advance.<br/><br/>On that basis, I've had a lot of success with Archipelago, The Quiet Year and Mars Colony. I suspect Kingdom and Microscope would also do this.<br/><br/>If there were 2-player variants of Fiasco, Primetime Adventures and Shock, I imagine they'd do the same. Fiasco, particularly is amazing at generating a story during play.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426051">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Crunch" title="Crunch"><img alt="Crunch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Crunch">Crunch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426051/#Comment_426051" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-19T14:10:42+00:00" title="December 19, 2013  2:10PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Microscope very much does this.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426076">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426076/#Comment_426076" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-20T06:39:51+00:00" title="December 20, 2013  6:39AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why not just create a new set of characters and situations for Lady Blackbird?
