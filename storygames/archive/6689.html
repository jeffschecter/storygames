Other projects, you know how it gets. <br/><br/>Anyway, to be entirely honest this one isn't a game (yet - it might well be in the future). It's a fiction project. But Story-Games is the most astonishing collection of lateral thinkers I know, so...<br/><br/>Imagine you have this stuff. It's technological rather than magical. It's relatively cheap and available. Using simple computerized controls, you can get it to morph, in real time, into any shape you want. It will then stay that shape until you get it to change again. So by doing this repeatedly you can make it move around as well as morphing.<br/><br/>When it's first invented it's kind of grainy, feels rubbery, comes only in silver and when it moves it looks like a 1950s monster movie. As it develops, though, it becomes controllable to microscopic scale, can change texture to a degree, can change colour, moves smoothly and has considerable tensile strength. You can embed sensors and other electronics in it, and it can have internal moving parts, like wheels.<br/><br/>My question is: If you had this stuff, what would you do with it? You personally, and people in general?<br/><br/>Bonus question: What issues can you see it creating as well as solving?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148179">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148179/#Comment_148179" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-04T16:11:22+00:00" title="June  4, 2008  4:11PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First it would be used by science. Exploring places that can't be reached by conventional ways, in which robots can't adapt enough and human would be in too much jeopardy...<br/><br/>Then the military would see the usefulness and potential in this. (At this stage they would supply the scientists with the resources that would allow that allow that evolution in the thing.) A multi-purpose thing would find all ways of military implications. Terrain reconnoitering, transportation, combat, defense...<br/><br/>Afterwards it would reach the private sector. All sort of business would quickly come to realize the different applications, and would come with new ways of profiting from it.<br/><br/>And as long as there is profit, there will be both legal and illegal activities tied to it.<br/><br/>The problem is the thing is both useful and dangerous. In the wrong hands it can mean chaos and destruction, death and fear... But so is the price of technology.<br/><br/>Eventually it would reach the commons' hands. By this time, more advanced, controlled and powerful versions would be the norm (at least at the higher levels). They have changed the ways of science, war, business and politics, and influenced everyone and anything (both directly and indirectly). Of course, the higher you stand, the more control/safety/power is within your grasp.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_148193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148193/#Comment_148193" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-04T16:54:27+00:00" title="June  4, 2008  4:54PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, that's pretty much the pattern for every technology.<br/><br/>What I'm looking for is what this technology, specifically, would be used for, specifically.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148204">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148204/#Comment_148204" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-04T17:34:06+00:00" title="June  4, 2008  5:34PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wikiable public art.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_148207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148207/#Comment_148207" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-04T17:42:54+00:00" title="June  4, 2008  5:42PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now that's what <i>I'm</i> talking about.<br/><br/>Excellent, Mike.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148210">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades" title="guildofblades"><img alt="guildofblades" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades">guildofblades</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148210/#Comment_148210" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-04T17:53:23+00:00" title="June  4, 2008  5:53PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I imagine they would use it as adaptable robots.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou stick a small computer in its head with a wireless connection. You can then upload new programs to it any time you want. Since by the simple process of changing shape, it can effectively move. Assuming the changing of the shape can happen so rapidly as to act like a fluidly moving living thing, then it could be programs with subrutines to take nearly any shape, run, jog, punch, kick, fight, guard, carry groeceries, whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn entire industry of companies would pop up that did nothing but supply programming modules that you can customize and upload to the computer driving your adaptable robot. Voice driven commands tied to voice recognition software would be the norm.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the stuff was easily made, the things would replace manual labor in almost every job sector. <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, the military would adapt it for a great many things. Automated soldiers. Spy plains that could dump their fuel tanks, land and then morph into a ground based espesionage robots, special opts units or even assassins. They could simply be used as an automated device to lug bombs, poisons or other hazardous materials places where plains can't easily deploy them and where it would be very risky for regular soldiers to do so.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou just know some company is going to figure out how to toss all sorts of dyes and colors into them so they material can take the appearance of a human, wigs and all. And shortly following that, you'll have a sex trade based on them.<br/>\n<br/>\nHumans better fear the day, however, they develope AI with a conscious awareness.<br/>\n<br/>\nRyan S.

Maybe a small unit can steal material from the fricking dirt. Drive a jeep out into the middle of the Australian bush, click the "on" button and get the fuck away from it.

Does it just go soft, or does it pull random forms from its database, or what? Humans make a lot of unreliable technology, and it is most often the cheapest or best marketed, not the most reliable, that gains market dominance.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow often can it be re-used? I see the designers working in some sort of artificial limit on it, so that you have to buy more later. I also see "hackers" finding ways to extend or even remove that limit. When that happens, material capitalism crashes because the putty can replace multiple items, which is a problem, because software capitalism (the patterns for the different forms) is a little unstable as it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow strong is it? This may limit a lot of what can be done with it, and it's another place for artificial limits. What colour is it?  If it can turn into clothing, then keeping up with the fashion industry is as simple as downloading the right design (magazines become distribution channels, instead of just advertising). Your clothing may even change while you're wearing it, which brings up the reliability issue, and lots of embarrassing situations.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Holo-projection system may seem limiting at first, until you realize that it could physically hold its own projection system, or possibly react to someone else's projection system unless there was some sort of signature worked into the holo-projection (more opportunity for problems or hacking!).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_148232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148232/#Comment_148232" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-04T19:34:58+00:00" title="June  4, 2008  7:34PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>It is the perfect spare part when storage is an issue.

Now you purchase data (Gu models), which is more or less infinitely copyable, and the material is just Gu and the energy comes from wherever and is purchased on credit card.  <br/><br/>People make money by creating new models. <br/><br/>Paul, you don't get up and put your clothes inside it. You don't have clothes or a desk. You have whatever you have downloaded. You don't have multiple sets of clothes. You have Gu and clothes models. You don't have furniture. You have Gu and furniture models. You don't even have to undress. You just have your controller create a bed for you, get in, and your clothes absorb into the sheets. When it's time to get up, you just get up and the Gu floor morphs clothes onto your body. <br/><br/>The problems left to solve are energy purchases, Gu storage and transport, where the controller resides (if anywhere), and model purchase and storage. Data security, intellectual property, and financial transaction security become the real problems. See RIAA and Napster for examples of where that's going. Also, Gu might come with new environmental concerns. How does it interact with wildlife? What happens when a rogue AI gets some?<br/><br/>Can Gu build a Gu manufacturing plant? Imagine the plans got tossed out on the future equivalent of BitTorrent. Everyone can download their own Gu plant. Assuming there's not some really hard to get natural resource (like Pollonium) that Gu can't create (intentionally?), the Gu patent holders are now in a bad situation. Sounds like the making of a cyberpunk novel to me. Is it cheaper to make your own Gu plant and Gu-raw-material-mine than to buy the Gu? I assume so.<br/><br/>What if someone puts some "bad Gu" out on the street. A cheap knockoff. It's defective, or inferior. <br/><br/>What if someone puts anti-Gu out on the street. Nano that loves it some Gu, yuuum yuuuum! Houses start dissolving. <br/><br/><hr/><br/>I think Neal Stephenson contemplates something much like Gu in one of his Victorian-cyberpunk novels. Every household has a fabricator machine and a utility line that pipes the good nano gunk into the house. They just purchase the blueprints for stuff. His gunk is way more limited than Gu, but some of his nano stuff is self-replicating.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148495">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148495/#Comment_148495" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-05T18:29:01+00:00" title="June  5, 2008  6:29PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 5, 2008 6:29PM by Levi Kornelsen.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>Paul, you don't get up and put your clothes inside it.

Forget everything you know about possessions and start again.<br/><br/>Here's one of my scenarios: You want to travel somewhere and stay for a while.<br/><br/>You join a travel co-op. At a time mutually convenient, all of you ride your Gu to a central location and consolidate it into an aeroplane. You make sure you have the statutory two people on board with pilot training but it's 99.99% unlikely that they'll be needed. You fly off. You sleep well, because the Gu can be a bed just as easily as a chair. Anything you need during the flight, except food, is made from Gu at the time you need it and disappears back into the walls when you're finished with it.<br/><br/>You arrive and the plane breaks up. You ride your Gu to a hotel. The hotel has one story of restaurant at the bottom and a big central services shaft. Your Gu climbs the hotel and latches on to the power and water (data feed is wireless; maybe power is too, even). There's no reception, because check-in is electronic. There's no bellboy, because there's no luggage to carry; your luggage carries you.<br/><br/>When you want to go out, as much Gu as you need goes with you. It can be a horse, a bicycle, two sturdy men and a sedan chair, however you want to travel.<br/><br/>Also, think about: <b>the mainstreaming of cosplay</b>.<br/><br/>(Graham, I think a lot of people would. And with sensors embedded in the Gu, you could have a long-distance relationship with someone that was also up-close and personal. But then, what if she finds out that you've been morphing the Gu into her sister while you're together? Or what if she finds out that you <i>are</i> her sister?)<br/><br/>This is definitely going to be one of those do-your-head-in SF things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148544">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148544/#Comment_148544" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-06T02:49:51+00:00" title="June  6, 2008  2:49AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 6, 2008 2:51AM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Security seems like the biggest issue to me. Nobody wants to have a car made out of something that can be randomly turned into a sofa by anybody who feels like it. Currently if you want to destroy a building you need to get some bombs or something near it -- if it's made of a completely reprogrammable substance, all you need is a set of instructions.<br/><br/>Somehow I don't see people making anything important or public out of this stuff. Except awesome public sculpture, of course. I see a lot of specialized tools or private applications nobody is likely to care about. Fashion and furniture were definitely the first two things that came to mind -- but again, do you want to wear a suit that somebody can turn into napalm by pointing a hologram-emitter-thingy at you? I certainly don't.<br/><br/>If Gu is perfectly secure, that's another matter, but how does that work and how easily is it compromised? Does the corporation who makes it have a master key? Do governments? Can they make holo-nukes for desperate situations that simply reprogram all Gu in the affected area into molasses or air or whatever? For that matter what happens when you give Gu instructions to become a gas or other substance that will diffuse into the atmosphere? Can areas become saturated in Gu?

Some of what you say implies it cannot. This severely limits Gu's ability to shapechange, no?<br/>\nCan it make its own sensors, or do you have to "attach" an external sensor to the Gu (and if so, why)?<br/>\nCan it contain its own logic/computer device?<br/>\n<br/>\nIdears:<br/>\nWhere does the waste go? Even if Gu does not create any exhaust. Your examples presume a high level of human contact. What about fallen hairs, food crumbs, sweat, inhaling, exhaling and excrement? This present interesting ideas about how society changes if we don't have to go to a shared facility like a "bathroom". For instance the spread of disease goes down, etc.<br/>\nI think it HAS to be able to make a cutting edge, otherwise it would never be a useful kitchen gadget. Even a potato peeler has an edge...<br/>\nAlso, how does this effect the fashion industry? Will there be different brands of Gu? Like will people be able to sport their Gucchi Gu? And if so, how will these shape changing products establish their Service Mark?<br/>\nWill there be Gu Mechanics/technicians? How much control will they have over the Gu they service? How can you tell a good one from a bad one?<br/>\nHow does the user establish ownership/control of Gu?<br/>\nHow does interaction between Gu with different owners work? I mean if two people wanna make out while wearing Gu suits, how does the collision detection work to allow them to touch each other. And contrast that with how the Collision detection has to work for Car-Formed Gu?<br/>\nAlso, I don't think Speed limits based on mass works, or Gu could never be used as a transportation device, no?<br/>\nI think the economy becomes about pre-canned code. there are a lot of tools out there that let you customize, but no one ever does it, they download a utility that does it for them and put up with the stuff it does they don't like, right? So, what happens when you get a MS-like entity dominating the market?<br/>\nAlso, there is a huge service industry this marginalizes (bellboys in your example, but Shirpas as well, right?), how will they be integrated into this bright new future? Even if they AREN'T, there needs to be propaganda that people can believe to assure themselves that Gu is not destroying the world...<br/>\nFinally, why can't it make food? I get why people might be hesitant to eat it, but is it programmed or otherwise unable to be digested?<br/>\n  Anyways, sounds VERY interesting, keep us posted, ok?<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148783">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148783/#Comment_148783" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-07T21:16:43+00:00" title="June  7, 2008  9:16PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The amount of manufacturing facilities that would shut down is staggering.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_148791">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148791/#Comment_148791" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-08T00:17:41+00:00" title="June  8, 2008 12:17AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have to agree with Jason and Daniel. Not only is the potential for harm staggering, but your optimism about the end of manufacturing is... premature?<br/><br/>So this stuff changes shape based on holograms projected at it? So what happens when somebody accidentally projects a meat-packing machine hologram onto your Gu-car while you are driving? You get meat-packed. Vehicles are dangerous enough as it is. Will the Gu protect you in the event of a crash? I suppose if your electronics are good enough, your car could transform into a pillow upon impact! Unless there is some other hologram projecting into that space.<br/><br/>I don't want clothes that change shape, I want clothes that won't fall off. If there is even a small chance that clothes might eviscerate me, I am not going to wear them.<br/><br/><br/>Holographic overlap is going to be a big issue, depending on how much Gu you have going on in the world. If you don't have enough Gu, does it only partially fill out a space? How fast does it transform? And so how fast does it move? Can you modify it so that each X volume of Gu has a slightly different chemical makeup and thus us affected by a different frequency of holographic projection?<br/><br/>I don't see the end of manufacturing, but I can see Gu/non-Gu hybrids. Certain sections of machines could easily be made of Gu, especially exteriors. If the outsie of your car is made of Gu, you can control it's cosmetics while the engine remains invulnerable to holograms.<br/><br/>Just some thoughts. At the extreme end of nanotechnology, anything is possible.

Nano scale operations are now a matter of everyday. Operations' implements have been reduced to optic fiber covered in very specialized gu. Non invasive procedures are commonplace, and scientists claim to be close to terminating cellular diseases such as cancer or AIDS. Cell regeneration is now a simple and beneficial procedure. Prosthetics are not limited to external limbs, it can also mean prosthetic inner organs and stuff...<br/><br/>And, of course, what can cure can also kill. All sort of techo-illnesses and poisons are the most problematic weapons of spies, assassins and bio-techno warfare. The most innocuous stuff is now processed with anti-gu scanners and containers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149416">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149416/#Comment_149416" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-10T15:21:24+00:00" title="June 10, 2008  3:21PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 10, 2008 3:22PM by MikeRM.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gucci, Gucci Gu!<br/><br/>Couldn't resist that one.<br/><br/>Some great stuff here, let me go through it in order.<br/><br/>ICE: Gu is always the same, solid substance, kind of a rubbery-plasticy thing. It can't turn into napalm or molasses or gas. And the more I think about it, the more it needs to be keyed to the owner so that random strangers can't reprogram your plane into something unaerodynamic. And yet it needs to have some kind of security override or it will simply be banned as too dangerous. Hmmm, much more pondering needed there.<br/><br/>Graham: Gu in Japanese means tool, means, or ingredients. I'm not sure if the dessert/energy gel was named with that in mind, but <i>my</i> Gu was.<br/><br/>Dave: Some great stuff here.<br/><br/>1. Can it change its volume? Not its mass, but by developing internal cavities it can change its volume up to a point (the point, obviously, at which it's too thin to support itself).<br/><br/>2. Can it make its own sensors and other electronic/computational stuff? Initially no; later on, probably. (In effect it's a different kind of morphing substance, or probably more than one, with different electrical properties, that can be redistributed throughout the Gu as needed.)<br/><br/>3. The Gu diaper has crossed my mind. In a Gu-suit, as in a space suit, you can let go and the suit will deal with it and dispose of the residue at a discreet moment in some public facility. So potentially you end up with an entire younger generation which is never toilet-trained, and an older generation that finds that disgusting.<br/><br/>4. Cutting edge - hmmm. Needs more thought. Perhaps that's an early safety feature which is later superseded by better intelligent interlocks to prevent people cutting themselves (or, more importantly, each other).<br/><br/>5. Fashion industry - what I see happening is that the really wealthy people use old-fashioned "stiffstuff" which can't change its shape. It's conspicuous consumption not to use Gu. (Much as a really hoity-toity kitchen would be almost without plastic.) So there's a high-end fashion industry which uses traditional materials, and a low-end fashion industry which is much more like downloadable skins for your Gu-suit.<br/><br/>I'll switch to quoting now:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DInDenver</cite>Will there be Gu Mechanics/technicians? How much control will they have over the Gu they service? How can you tell a good one from a bad one?</blockquote>\nNo moving parts, so probably no need for service. I'm thinking: it has a limited lifespan, so many tens of thousands of morphs, after which it starts to become less flexible and respond more slowly and you either pass it on to the poor (whose possessions consist almost entirely of Gu) or recycle it. \n<blockquote>How does the user establish ownership/control of Gu?</blockquote>\nSome kind of molecular/electronic key thingy. Handwavium, at this stage. I need to think about that - at least what it would look like, if not actually how it works.\n<blockquote><br/>How does interaction between Gu with different owners work? I mean if two people wanna make out while wearing Gu suits, how does the collision detection work to allow them to touch each other. And contrast that with how the Collision detection has to work for Car-Formed Gu?<br/></blockquote>\nTwo people in the same space, or different spaces? Because in different spaces you just have your Gu-suit here and your Guplicate over there, and your friend has vice versa. And the Gu-suit flexes in the relevant places. In the same space, I guess you either take the Gu-suit off or it again flexes. There's a Piers Anthony short story that comes to mind, I don't remember the title, though.<br/><br/>Oh, and there are parental controls on Gu-suits for minors that are supposed to prevent sexual activity. Whole secondary hacking industry from that alone.<br/><br/>For car-formed Gu, I think it would have to soften whenever it hit anything. Perhaps it's soft all the time - so you have padded cars. Perhaps all consumer Gu softens if it hits anything hard enough to do damage - you have to use special industrial Gu for tools where that's the idea. Or stiffstuff.\n<blockquote>Also, I don't think Speed limits based on mass works, or Gu could never be used as a transportation device, no?</blockquote>\nCorrect, but as above, you might have a safety feature where any collision is softened.\n<blockquote><br/>I think the economy becomes about pre-canned code. there are a lot of tools out there that let you customize, but no one ever does it, they download a utility that does it for them and put up with the stuff it does they don't like, right? So, what happens when you get a MS-like entity dominating the market?</blockquote>\nWhat indeed. But there will always be a Linux equivalent for the rebels-at-heart.<br/><br/>[Continued...]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149420">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149420/#Comment_149420" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-10T15:34:46+00:00" title="June 10, 2008  3:34PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Also, there is a huge service industry this marginalizes (bellboys in your example, but Shirpas as well, right?), how will they be integrated into this bright new future?

I would think that the controller would prevent you from attempting to create something larger than you have Gu for.<br/><br/>At first, it transforms relatively slowly - hence the first Gu constructs look like bad stop-animation. Eventually it gets faster.\n<blockquote>Can you modify it so that each X volume of Gu has a slightly different chemical makeup and thus us affected by a different frequency of holographic projection?</blockquote>\nThat's kind of where I was going with the "chemical-electronic handwavium key" thing.\n<blockquote>I don't see the end of manufacturing, but I can see Gu/non-Gu hybrids.

I see potential for disaster. Imagine waiting for a perfect billiard-style shot to bump 1, 2 or more people into a busy street by bumping a guy in a Gu suit from a block (or more) away...<br/>\n - Low Speed, wanted: I am in a fashionable Gu Tuxedo, she is in a sexy Gu French maid outfit. We don't wanna take our clothes off, but we wanna make out. How does the Gu know we want to have a low speed impact? I see the potential for a Dune-like assault technique if the answer is move slower...<br/>\n - High speed unwanted, how does the same Gu react to high speed collision. If it is designed to accept some impact (making out), how does the software reconcile this with other high speed impacts?<br/>\n - High speed, wanted, presumably this would be the perfect ingredients for traveling shows and bumper cars would be great if the cars can look like whatever you want (George W Bush's head, Feraris, etc). So, how do you tell the Gu its OK if these two bumper cars impact?<br/>\n  Well, I hope this helps with your imagining of a bright new future!<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149778">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149778/#Comment_149778" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T14:20:33+00:00" title="June 11, 2008  2:20PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Public toilets would suddenly be really excellent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149780/#Comment_149780" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T14:24:52+00:00" title="June 11, 2008  2:24PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MikeRM</cite>Yep.

Why not have Gu come preloaded with a bunch of popular shapes, like computers that come preloaded with an operating system and applications, and have a memory space where you can load additional ones?<br/><br/>In a society where computing is ubiquitous and everything is Net-enabled and the network is the computer, of course, it's a bit of an academic distinction.<br/><br/>While the idea of search-and-seizure of weaponized codecs is an attractive one from a story point of view - it's probably where Charles Stross would take it, for example - I don't see it as a robust solution for the problem of Gu weapons.<br/><br/>My thinking at the moment is that if safety-mode Gu senses it's moving rapidly, it foams - the more rapidly, the more foamy - so that you end up with something like foam rubber between you and any impact. So you could do boffer LARP really easily - form all the weapons out of Gu and the faster (hence harder) you strike with them, the softer they are. (I'd forgotten the Dune thing, thanks for the reminder.)<br/><br/>Also, if you fire a Gu bullet at someone they end up getting hit with a small piece of foam rubber.<br/><br/>My physics isn't good enough to calculate the speed and acceleration of a couple making out precisely, but my gut feel is that it wouldn't be fast enough to cause Gu to foam unless they were doing wushu porn. Which I suppose they might be, but in that case they might have to dispense with the Gu.<br/><br/>I'm using lots of nerd examples here, but I'll seed another one for people to think about. Game platform. Even if you don't have direct neural connection (which is possible in this setting), a reasonable amount of Gu will give you an in-home motion platform that you can use with VR goggles to experience virtual worlds. You can walk around (staying in one place; the Gu forms a treadmill), drive vehicles, fly, touch things and pick them up, fight opponents and feel the impact, kiss the princess...<br/><br/>And it will fit into your bedroom.

You don't want to rent the right amount of land and the right amount of Gu for six months prior to the date, just for prototyping ... no, it costs you no extra Gu, but it means that you need to production resources full-time.  If the CAD-CAM is good enough then you can design it virtually, then rent the facility for a day, and set up in minutes while your friends are driving over.<br/><br/>Virtual space and materials is to real world space and Gu like the banking system is to currency:  It expands the supply, by taking advantage of the fact that not everyone needs the resources at the same time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149877">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149877/#Comment_149877" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T18:46:15+00:00" title="June 11, 2008  6:46PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gotcha.<br/><br/>A theme park for your friend's birthday?

Basically, in this society, these guys can write their own check. The only way that the big corps can prevent this is to turn it into a production methodology. Like one person/team works only on textures, one only works on movement models, one only works on structural dynamics, etc. This way, one coder can't hold the product hostage for a raise. But then there is ample room for a GDG (Gu Developers Guild) to counter that, so I dunno.<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_151110">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151110/#Comment_151110" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-16T19:33:31+00:00" title="June 16, 2008  7:33PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 16, 2008 7:36PM by MikeRM.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, <a href="http://gu-novel.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">Gu is here</a>.
