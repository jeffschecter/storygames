It went pretty well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe adventure I ran (not including the parts where they went off the reservation) is <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.colugo.org/jmcmurra/Scion/Campaign/1%20-%20The%20Escape/index.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. It involves waking up in a cell, escaping, and finding your way to civilization. It's meant as an introduction to Scion's modern mythology setting, so involves a few chances to interact with the occult, but no overtly supernatural things.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne really nice part about it is that the game flowed incredibly smoothly and the session went a lot faster than I'm used to. No dice, no tables, and no rules debates was really sweet. I had four scenes prepped, which usually would have taken most of the night, but we finished after a handful of hours.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe look on the players' faces when I responded to "I try to ___," with "do you succeed?" was pretty nice. I was pleasantly surprised when the response wasn't always "with flying colors." The players had a general idea of whether they wanted to be great, mediocre, or horrible at something and rolled with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, the characters ended up being pretty well rounded. Instead of hyperspecializing and fulfilling "party roles" like we frequently do, they ended up with much more organic builds.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll-in-all it was pretty cool. I'd happily do it again.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
