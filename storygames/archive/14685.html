The small villages they travel through are honor-bound to play against them, and no matter who wins there's a big feast to honor them because the village is just so happy to have anything of any interest in their lives. <br/><br/>And as he's talking, I realize, shit, this is just a few playbooks away from an Apocalypse World game.<br/><br/>Figure there's a Captain playbook, kind of a mashup between the Touchstone and the Chopper? You'll need a Runner playbook of some sort \u2013 make the graphic from a photo of a jammer from some roller derby team. And probably also, rather than (or in addition to) sex moves, there are all kinds of moves for feasting with your opponents, or feasting in general. The rest I don't know. I'm undecided on exactly how the sport they play works, and whether it's called Apocalypse Ball or actually Rolfball.<br/><br/>What else we got?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333886">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333886/#Comment_333886" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-11T12:33:57+00:00" title="July 11, 2011 12:33PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That was a decent sci-fi flick.

And you play rolfball.<br/><br/>That way, you could have basic moves &amp; special moves dedicated to rolfball.<br/>Basic rolfball moves might be: When You Run The Field, When You Make a Long Pass, When You Take Someone Out. Something like that.<br/><br/>Rolfball Playbooks could use an entirely different set of stats, since rolfball would be a distinct subsystem.<br/>Maybe: Speed, Strength, Endurance, Weird.<br/><br/>Maybe each Rolfball playbook could be tied to an ideal AW playbook: The Runner could have "If you're a Battlebabe, add 1 to all spinning feints."

Sometimes you have to smack the skull around, more like polo, instead of running with it. There are different ways of interpreting the weapons. <br/><br/>Some actually try to create the big ol Chain weapon, apparently. I think that's insanely dangerous, personally.<br/><br/>The movie is very fun. It's hilarious because it follows all the genre conventions of a sports movie (struggling team, gets a new player, trains hard but suffers losses, squeaks their way to a championship) and nearly ignores the genre conventions of a post apoc movie, except that there's a lot of dirt and leather and poor living conditions.<br/><br/>Sex moves would definitely be of particular importance to a Jugger team.<br/><br/>If you were simulating a game with dice, it's a low scoring game, like hockey or soccer. But it's played on a time limit, so scores can vary. A score of 1-2 is just as likely as a score of 3-4, but scores souldn't go much higher than that.<br/><br/>An important part of playing Jugger is injuring the opponents. Going for pain that will effect the opponent later in the match is just as important of a strategy as going for the current point. So the minigame rules should emphasize that choice. This is especially true for the simpler teams who have maybe 1 or 2 subs. A primo team would have a deeper bench and be less susceptible to that strategy, which would be an important differentiator.<br/><br/>Perhaps if you wanted to only have the PCs be the players, a player could have a special ability to have a sub that can play the rest of the match for them if they get injured. But the same roleplayer would continue to play as the sub. I don't know AW well enough to know whether that's a good idea, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333927/#Comment_333927" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-11T19:22:35+00:00" title="July 11, 2011  7:22PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OH!
