Once I have gone far enough that I can barely see the walls of the hold, I fall to my knees and call out "Mother Winter! Mother Winter! Another has died of the Weeping Plague. This time it was a child. Hear my call and come to me!"<br/><br/><b>MC</b>: ((That sounds like Beatlejuice. P2, roll Hx.))<br/><br/><b>P2</b>: *rolls, gets an eight* The shadows under the trees thicken and you realize that what you thought were the branches, bare of leaves, are the tatters of Mother Winters cloak. Her mouth peels back in a sad smile, thin runnels of black blood seeping from her cracked lips. ((I choose to be able to speak)) "What would you have of Mother Winter? I will not return the dead to life. The cost of such things is too high."<br/><br/><b>P1</b>: "I ask not for life, but for death. Their ghosts linger. They haunt my steps. I can stand it no longer. I cannot sleep."<br/><br/><b>P2</b>: "This thing I can do. Come to the crossroads at moon-rise. Bring the body of the child. We will see about these ghosts."<br/><br/><b>P1</b>: "And the cost? What is the - "<br/><br/><b>MC</b>: At that moment you hear crashing in the woods behind you. You hear Shugusa's frantic voice calling your name. Your followers have found you, worried that you'll do yourself some injury in your grief. When you turn back, Mother Winter is gone, leaving only shadows and the creaking sound of trees. <br/><br/>The idea isn't that every time someone says the syllables of your name that you get a ping, it's when someone calls you specifically, to threaten, to deal, to beg for help, THAT's when the move triggers.<br/><br/>Any suggestions on how to reword it?\n<blockquote>I would give the Hag only 1 extra move because Cauldron is extremly powerfull. </blockquote>\nIt is very powerful, but it's basically the Workshop move from the Savvyhead, and the Savvyhead gets two moves. Do you think the wider narrative vector of 'magic' over 'technology' make the Cauldron more useful? I think it <i>might</i> be, but I'm not sure. \n<blockquote>What advancements does a Hag get? <br/>I guess you would be able to pick up Followers and Moonlighting?</blockquote>\nAck, forgot about those. Yes to Moonlighting, no to followers. You are an outsider. You don't get to have people that easily.\n<blockquote><br/>Someone came to you for a ritual in a time of need. Ask them what you did for them and tell them +3.  <br/>does not work. It should be +2.

I want you to have to use a specific technique to roll weird, rather than have it be something you have all the time.\n<blockquote>I still really like this!

It -will- work on NPCs provided that the MC decides to simply have the NPCs activate it when it would be appropriate to the fiction or as part of a move. <br/><br/>This move is an extremely easy way to <i>offer an opportunity</i>, <i>announce off-screen or future badness</i>, or to <i>put someone on the spot.</i><br/><br/>As for Magic... hmmm, I guess it depends on how gonzo your Workshop users go. If a Savvyhead and a Hag both want to make it rain, both of them can. The Hag calls the rain with a ritual, the Savvyhead builds a weather control device. Both of them do the same thing, but the Savvyheads weather control is a physical object, while the Ritual is a thing done once (unless the ritual is to imbue a hollow stick with Rain Making qualities).<br/><br/>I'm not really seeing a huge difference to be honest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Praion" title="Praion"><img alt="Praion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Praion">Praion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409352/#Comment_409352" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-17T13:12:52+00:00" title="March 17, 2013  1:12PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well i don't know anything about technology or magic but it seems easier to use a weather spell then to figure out how to build a rain machine and then build one...

My issue is that having your own Followers, combined with <i>Blessings Be</i> would be too powerful. The Hag isn't about leading, it's about fucking with other people's followers.<br/><br/>I'll work something out. \n<blockquote><br/>2) The gear section seems overloaded with stuff that is simply there for "flavor."

As a Hag you get only a single symbol of power. The rest of the list are examples of possible symbols. <br/><br/>The symbol is not mechanically relevant. It is purely for flavor. I'll edit the first post to make that more clear. \n<blockquote><br/>I disagree with <a href="/forums/profile/Praion">@Praion</a>.

When I playtest, I'm going to keep a close eye on the options that the MC picks, and I will probably reduce the list down to the ones that he ends up using. It's quite long at the moment, and short lists are better.\n<blockquote><br/>I agree with him about Beetlejuice. It's a little strange how this might get activated by NPCs.

I am totally going to make that another move, because it is really insidious. <br/><br/>I'm going to leave Beatlejuice alone for the moment. I know it's confusing, but I'm going to want to see it in play before I revise it. \n<blockquote><br/>Oh yeah!<br/>And here's an alpha-build trifold playbook I made = <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B9cu0IVYfHtiZ2hyVmM5Vy1EdG8/edit" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B9cu0IVYfHtiZ2hyVmM5Vy1EdG8/edit</a><br/>I don't have a picture yet, I'm kind of busy this week but as soon as I get some time to make one I'll add it to the pdf.<br/>Also, you can see where the empty spaces are ripe for filling in with more details.

Effectively, they set the scene by saying "X is calling for you, do you respond?" and then the scene proceeds from there. \n<blockquote><br/>Blessings Be<br/><br/>This is actually the one that worries me!

The idea is that the Hags very presence can bless or curse a community. You do not want the Hag mad at you because your followers will be stricken with famine and disease. You want them happy, scared, or sufficiently bribed to hold back their influence. <br/><br/>Or you can just go out and burn down her shack with her inside it. <br/><br/>It is supposed to be very powerful, and yes, activating three wants in one go is REALLY nasty. But imagine the response from the community. If you know that the reason that your people are starving is because The Prince of Locusts is out on his mountain giving your crops the Evil Eye, I think you might go and DO something about that. <br/><br/>Something permanent. <br/><br/>And if you don't, if you go up there and instead hash out some kind of deal with the crazy old codger, you might find that some of your followers aren't particularly happy about that. <br/><br/>Drama and blood. <br/><br/>I might find some alternative mechanics. I think that you should probably have to DO something, even if it's just glaring down from your mountain to blight crops, or disemboweling a cat to start a plague. <br/><br/>Something like:<br/><br/><b>BLESSINGS BE...</b><br/>When you do a some kind of ritual action and set your will on a community roll + weird. On a hit you can activate a Want or Surplus of that community. On a 10+ the effect happens quickly and as subtly as you want it to be, on a 7-9 pick one:<br/>- your hand in the matter is as hidden or as obvious as you'd like it to be<br/>- the blessing or curse goes into effect quickly\n<blockquote><br/>Cauldron<br/>Also, is it your intention that the Hag starts kind of "unsettled" and then has to go to work (and/or have sex with someone) to create a Place of Power? That can work.<br/><br/>If not, then you should do some kind of pick-and-choose create your own Place of Power for the playbook, like how the Hoarder creates his Hoard and the Savvyhead creates his workshop.</blockquote>\nHmm... I was deliberately leaving that up to the player and the MC to work out, but I think most everyone would want to start with one. \n<blockquote><br/>One of the problems with "magic" is that we really have no idea what it's capable of and what it's not capable of.<br/></blockquote>\nYes, that is an issue. I think that I might include some MC advice and examples of possible Rituals.\n<blockquote><br/>Maybe the options for creating a Place of Power could include what kinds of spirits are drawn to your Place of Power? That would give us some guidance for what you can do with it, and lead to some interesting situations where the Hag might need to create other Places in order to accomplish different things. (Much like how a Savvyhead with a lab and an infirmary has very different capabilities than one with hi-tech electronics in a van.) <br/><br/>For instance, I'd imagine having to establish a Place of Power on the site of a massacre in order to commune with the dead, or maybe a Place of Power on top of the highest hill in the region in order to control the weather.</blockquote>\nOoh. That makes the Sex Move more interesting. If you have to define a list of appropriate influences for every Place of Power. That would make every potential partner a unique source of Power. <br/><br/>I really like this idea.

The reference to the "Stephen King apocalypse" makes it fit nicely for me.<br/><br/>I love the new Blessings Be move mechanically! That's much better. However, I agree with IceCreamEmperor: it needs an interesting fictional trigger, something that we want to see happen at the table. (And something that has the Hag actually, you know, interact with another character!)<br/><br/>That's the main problem with this playbook, as IceCreamEmperor points out: it screams "I'm going to sit by myself off in the distance, and maybe influence things indirectly". That's a tough starting point for a good multi-player game.<br/><br/>One possible solution would be to include some kind of moves or structure that have to do with people who are really important to the Hag. From the Batman angle, maybe someone (one person or a group) that the character really wants to protect or save? Or a villain/nemesis? <br/><br/>Are you familiar with Monsterhearts? They way the Mortal interacts with his or her "lover" is a good model for this: the very existence of the playbook in play frames a really important relationship which will feature heavily in the game. If I were writing a "Batman" playbook, I'd imagine having a "true love" who Batman must protect (or abandon) in exchange for bonuses, XP, or other advantages and disadvantages. And a failed relationship with that person means powerlessness or self-destruction for the Batman character, who now relies on the romantic interest to come and rescue him, or at least show him which way the exit from his self-destructive path lies.<br/><br/>Adding some moves which define how the Hag interacts with people in some way other than "staying distant and running away" will really help here. The most interesting hook for this I can see is the connection between the Place of Power and the sex move. Maybe the Hag *has* to create certain romantic connections in order to survive or in order to achieve his/her ends? That would make for some interesting play, no doubt. (It also connects to certain types of mythology about disgusting hag-type creatures who have an alternate self that's all about seducing people in the middle of the night, in disguise, like the succubus, appearing in people's sexual dreams, and similar kind of imagery.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409482">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JackFractal" title="JackFractal"><img alt="JackFractal" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JackFractal">JackFractal</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409482/#Comment_409482" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-18T11:57:20+00:00" title="March 18, 2013 11:57AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Savvyhead is probably the worst of the basic playbooks when it comes to ending up isolated and uninvolved in the game.

No mob, no move.<br/><br/>It is vulnerable in precisely the same way as the Clerics 'Turn Undead' move is vulnerable in Dungeon World. None of these moves are usable without a specific fictional trigger, a trigger which is entirely outside the control of the player whose character has the move. <br/><br/>I've set <i>Blessings Be</i> to have an ambiguous fictional trigger because I believe the interesting part isn't HOW you use the move, but the decision of whether or not to use the move in the first place, and when you <i>do</i> use it, the repercussions AFTER the move goes into effect. <br/><br/>I could be completely wrong.

(Btw, the Touchstone is already the moocher playbook, and has moves to back that up.) I think 'you don't start with Barter' is an very indirect and ineffective way to signal to the player that they need to start extorting people. The degree to which MCs differ in terms of 'making them pay' for things like food/shelter is in my experience considerable, so in some groups this will work great and in others the player may not even notice until like the fourth session.<br/><br/>Having an actual move or two that triggers off those sort of activities, on the other hand, is much more likely to get the player on the right track. If it's a big deal, if it's an epiphany, it should probably have moves.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409496">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Antisinecurist" title="Antisinecurist"><img alt="Antisinecurist" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Antisinecurist">Antisinecurist</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409496/#Comment_409496" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-18T14:42:02+00:00" title="March 18, 2013  2:42PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At the start of each session, as long as you're near a hold, roll+weird.

I don't see that. It's got (checks the playbook):<br/><br/>- a move for being absolutely devastating in combat<br/>- an extra 'choose a move from another playbook'<br/>- an 'I am the law, do what I say' move<br/>- two stat substitutions<br/>- one thing that lets you give other people xp<br/><br/>That last one is sort of an 'apply pressure to other PCs' move. Like a String from Monsterhearts. "Do what I want and I'll give you xp." Aside from that, it's not got much of anything related to extracting wealth from others. <br/><br/>Am I missing something?<br/><br/>Regarding the lack of barter not being a good impulse to action: I can see what you're getting at.<br/><br/>Lets look at <b><i>The Angel</i></b>. <br/><br/>The Angel starts with an Angel Bag. The engine of action for the Angel works like this: <br/><br/>- people get hurt, because the Apocalypse sucks<br/>- you're the only person who can heal people<br/>- people come to you when they're hurting<br/>- you heal them<br/>- using your Angel Bag costs Stock<br/>- Stock costs Jingle<br/>- you have to get Jingle from somewhere, otherwise the next torn up excuse for a human being who comes through your door will die on the table<br/>- people dying is generally accepted to be a Bad Thing<br/><br/>That's a good engine. It hums like a kitten.<br/><br/><b><i>The Savvyhead</i></b>'s is less good.<br/>- you are a clever bastard<br/>- you can fix or make things and you can offer good advice<br/>- things break because the Apocalypse Sucks<br/>- people come to you when they need things fixed<br/>- you fix them<br/>- it's not easy, sometimes you need money, sometimes you need the brains of six dogs stuffed full of electrodes and preserved in formaldehyde<br/><br/>See that? It doesn't feed back into itself like the Angel's does. It still works, but not as well and not as consistently. "Things working properly" is generally less dramatic then "stopping the bleeding" after all. <br/><br/><br/>Sometimes though, you don't need a something that complex to have a finely tuned engine. <br/><br/><b><i>The Operator</i></b><br/>- you are a suave bastard with a lot of irons in the fire<br/>- when you're out tending those irons, sometimes shit goes badly<br/>- if it goes badly, you're in for some tough times, better hope you have some friends<br/>- if it goes well, you have sacks of cash, it is suddenly very easy to acquire friends<br/><br/><br/>And sometimes you don't need an engine at all: <br/><br/><b><i>The Faceless</i></b><br/>- you are a terrifying monster that is basically unkillable<br/>- maybe your mask talks to you?<br/>- you are really good at killing<br/><br/>There's no engine driving the Faceless at all, but because the other PCs desires will often involve the removal of unnecessary people and/or protection from people who have similar notions about <i>their</i> relative necessity, the Faceless finds a place.<br/><br/>The sex move supports this. People want the Faceless around because sometimes you need a big freaky thing between you and the bad men with guns. Sleeping with the poor broken thing might, maybe, be worth having that protection. <br/><br/>The Faceless is driven by the other characters.<br/><br/><br/>This is what I want the Hags to be... I think<br/><br/><b><i>The Hag</i></b><br/>- you are a creepy bastard who lives alone in poverty<br/>- sometimes things go bad, real bad, and to fix them, people will do anything, cut any corner, take any shortcut<br/>- you are <b><i>good</i></b> at shortcuts<br/><br/>Not elegant, not a humming engine like the Operator or the Angel, but when combined with other players, I think it's enough. <br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Antisinecurest">@Antisinecurest</a> - Interesting idea, but I think I'd prefer to leave it less direct then your move.

The Angel's not so bad, not because they have a more clear-cut resource management cycle, but because 'people dying/suffering is bad -- and I'm the only one who can save them' is a very grabby premise that most players can easily buy into and turn into a sexy character.<br/><br/>The Savvyhead is not at a disadvantage because he doesn't have a clear barter-feedback cycle, but because his intrinsic motivations are more varied; the workshop rules are super useful, but they are also super-flexible, so they don't necessarily provide much guidance or guarantee an active role in the community; and the baseline personality for the archetype is less likely to care about other people, or about people at all. 'People to come to me to fix stuff, I fix it, then I wait around for more stuff to be broken' is not necessarily that interesting -- and it can proceed without much interaction with people. It's easy to get stuck in the workshop trap, which means depending on the MC to give you reasons to go outside. Much better to have your own reasons to go outside, or simply be the type of character who is 'outside' by default.

Crimson the pit fighter in a fit of jealousy asked me to curse Diamond, the star of the Pit so that he would be unable to participate in the fight the following night. I did, using the Pit as a Place of Power (+death,+bloodlust,+betrayal), something that has been established in the backstory, and gave Diamond the nastiest and most sudden bout of food poisoning you\u2019ve ever seen. <br/><br/>The MC told me that this meddling would have unanticipated consequences, and at the end of the session we learned that Diamond has been seen speaking with the leader of the Creepers, a crazy war cult. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t have used a place empowered by betrayal for my cursing....<br/><br/><b>DIM</b><br/>I didn\u2019t really get much use out of this one. I was never in a situation where people were contesting my movements, or where my presence was unwanted, so aside from a few special effects, I didn\u2019t get to play with this. <br/><br/>Still... I think it\u2019s a good move and I\u2019m hoping to see more use out of it later.<br/><br/><b>BLESSING BE...</b><br/>This one is going to have to be revised. I afflicted a group of War Cultists with Anxiety, which is going to lead to a variety of unpleasant outcomes, but while looking at the move during play and trying to figure out how to use it... it felt very awkward. <br/><br/>I love the idea, but the interaction with the Wants and Surplus system is very janky. <br/><br/>A lot of time, the various Wants don\u2019t make any sense. Disease is the easiest, but Judgement is confusing, and why would you afflict someone with Hunger if Famine is an option? Being able to bless a group with Augury or Insight is too powerful, etc. <br/><br/>I will be replacing this move with <b>EVIL EYE</b>. <br/><br/><b>BEATLEJUICE</b><br/>I wanted this move to work, but it didn\u2019t. The problem is, as people have rightly pointed out, that because it is not initiated by the Hag herself, the framing is awkward. If a PC calls you, it might work (but that is liable to be very rare) and if an NPC calls you then it\u2019s danged confusing. The MC in my game tried it, but it was very weird. He ran it like \u201cYou are being called by someone in the Pit\u201d and I rolled and then we framed the scene. I actually failed, and we ran into another problem of \u2018what happens when you fail this roll\u2019? It was clumsy, and awkward.<br/><br/>It\u2019s a cool power for an NPC, but for a PC, it\u2019s too passive. <br/><br/>I am replacing this move with <b>THE SENDING</b>. <br/><br/><br/><b>REPLACEMENT MOVES</b><br/>_________________________________________________________<br/><br/><b>EVIL EYE</b><br/>When you spit and curse at a person or a group of people in public hold 1 against them. <br/><br/>Hold an additional 1 against them if : <br/>  - you make a big show of it by going after them in the middle of a crowded market, or in front of their gang<br/>  - you make yourself bleed, dealing 1 harm (ap) to yourself<br/><br/>You may spend your hold 1 for 1 to cause:<br/>  - they take (1 harm, ap) from accident, misfortune, or disease<br/>  - they are sickened, blinded, or confused (s-harm, ap)<br/>  - they lose their way<br/>  - something important to them is lost, broken, or befouled<br/><br/>For every Harm the person or group causes the Hag, she loses one hold. <br/><br/><b>THE SENDING</b><br/>When you send your spirit to someone roll + weird. On a hit, you find them when they are in a dark and lonely place. On a 7-9, you find them in a dark and lonely place but the MC picks one.<br/>  - you do not have much time<br/>  - trouble finds you<br/>If someone goes to a dark and lonely place and calls your name, you may go to them as though you rolled a 10.\n<blockquote>Hey, Jack!

Sure, you could get a Savvyhead to do something like that, give you a poison you slip in their beer that gives them bellyache, or in a more gonzo game, a Brown-Note projector to befoul all their fighting gear... but a curse, even one with nasty consequences like the one I performed on Monday, is conceptually easier.<br/><br/>Strangle rat, curse man, provoke betrayal. <br/><br/>So I wouldn't say that <b><i>THE CAULDRON</i></b> is intrinsically easier then attempting a similar thing using a Workshop, but it is more... malleable. <br/><br/>If you're willing to make great sacrifices or terrible bargains, the Cauldron can give you a short-cut to power.

It needed a more defined fictional trigger. <br/><br/>"Evil Eye", the replacement move, has a more concrete fictional requirements. We'll see how it goes on Monday.

It doesn't require any kind of specific action in the fiction. What's the fictional trigger? What does this mean, story-wise? What is the Hag doing, what does it look like on-screen? (Without that, it doesn't generate any fiction and it doesn't give us any real way to engage with the move. How would I interfere with the process? How could I help? How can I protect my community from this influence? I have absolutely no idea.)<br/><br/>2. It doesn't require for the Hag to actually, you know, interact with anyone. Boo. I say if you want to activate some wants or surpluses, you've got to go into that community and get your hands dirty. That will make for good play. Who likes you more now? Who did you impress? Who's pissed off now? Who thinks you're a threat? Who thinks you're worth following or imitating?<br/><br/>Just rolling for it... not for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JackFractal" title="JackFractal"><img alt="JackFractal" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JackFractal">JackFractal</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410257/#Comment_410257" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-23T15:35:26+00:00" title="March 23, 2013  3:35PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a><br/><br/>That's why "The Evil Eye" (not currently in the first post, bad me, must update) requires a specific fictional action (in this case, cursing at someone in public), with variations applied by additional fictional actions, such as doing it in front of their gang, or causing yourself harm by bloodletting. <br/><br/>I'm not really into having moves that don't require fictional actions either.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410266">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410266/#Comment_410266" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-23T17:53:19+00:00" title="March 23, 2013  5:53PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, yes!
