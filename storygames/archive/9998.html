It got downloaded a few times a month, according to my website stats, and I even got a couple actual play reports, which always pleasantly surprised me.  It was never a 'big game,' though, so my expectations were low (in fact, zero), so anything surpassed my expectations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221920">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221920/#Comment_221920" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-01T09:19:49+00:00" title="August  1, 2009  9:19AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 1, 2009 9:30AM by J_Walton.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tony, my current personal development/publishing model goes something like this: 1) release free editions of my game until I'm satisfied that it's as good as I can make it, 2) once it's in its final form, release a commercial version or contract with someone else who wants to publish a commercial version (but the free versions stay free, including the final finished document). This has a number of benefits, that I really like:<br/><br/>- no rushing to commercial publication (GenCon, when's that again?)<br/>- no worrying about the game being perfect before I release it<br/>- people can enjoy playing / playtesting my games right now<br/>- the iterative publication of free editions lets me gradually improve the text<br/>- it allows me to build up an audience for my games and gain feedback from them<br/>- if, ultimately, several of my games never make it to step 2... so what? people can still play them<br/>- I feel like "a real game designer" without feeling caught up in as much bullshit posturing<br/>- my games will ultimately end up better for it<br/>- i feel much less guilt about games not being done or out there<br/><br/>Of the games that I've released for free, the ones that I'm generally known for are Geiger Counter and Kazekami Kyoko Kills Kublai Khan. Since the alpha release, I've had 14 independent APs posted for Geiger, which is pretty damn good in my book, and 4 independent discussions of my game (all started by Ben Robbins). I keep a log of them <a href="http://bleedingplay.wordpress.com/geiger/" rel="nofollow">on my Geiger page</a>.  I know there's been more play than that too, but it did take a while for folks to really start playing it after I released it (a few months, at least) and there are large gaps in the stream of APs, not a steady progression, but I think that's pretty common for commercially published games too. Now that there's a bit of word-of-mouth out about Geiger, I never have trouble filling slots or pick-up games at conventions or meet-ups. If you release a free game, though, and people are already aware of you or your concepts are especially gripping or attractive (I'm thinking of the Red Box Hack, Dungeon Squad, and John Harper's recent releases), I think you can have free products really explode right out of the gate.<br/><br/>Kazekami Kyoko has had a somewhat different history.  I wrote it <a href="http://thou-and-one.blogspot.com/2006/01/kazekami-kyoko-kills-kublai-khan.html" rel="nofollow">in 2006</a> and I keep hearing something about it... once or twice a year, I'd say.  So very much a slow, slow burn but something that doesn't ever seem to go away.  And for a game I wrote in a couple of hours, I think that's pretty damn awesome.  There was <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=28133.0" rel="nofollow">a really cool thread on the Forge about it just recently</a>.<br/><br/>So, basically, right now I'm looking at free, iterative publication as the main thing I'm doing, since none of my games have made it to <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> yet (and, honestly, I'm increasingly fine with that). This isn't some prelude to the "big show" of commercial publishing; this is it.  The fact that folks like John Harper and Matt Wilson have been seduced and subverted to something vaguely resembling my publishing model -- which, honestly, I was seduced to by Clinton -- just makes it all the more fun and satisfying, since I'm not doing it by myself. Plus, John and Matt have clearly uped the ante, which just pushes me to make my free stuff better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221930/#Comment_221930" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-01T10:24:42+00:00" title="August  1, 2009 10:24AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My experience with operating for free is good and bad.<br/><br/>Good: It's more fun, it's no-pressure, it lets you look at your own stuff with far more actual clarity.

I really like my game Dulse, which is free like dirt, but nobody plays it as far as I know.  Dungeon Squad, which I wrote in an hour and am ambivalent about, has gone on to become a thing, has been hacked in wonderful ways, and was reprinted in a Mexican newspaper.  <br/><br/>Both are CC_A, and nothing has caused me to regret letting them loose.  If I'd charged cash money, I might have made a very small amount but Dungeon Squad in particular would have been fighting in a very crowded marketplace.  Instead, you know, Mexican newspaper, yay.  Dulse, on the other hand, is a very gauzy hippie game that might have got more play if I'd charged a few dollars for it.  <br/><br/>If I were to write up "Official Advanced Dungeon Squad" now, I bet I could sell quite a few copies to people who have really enjoyed the original.  I won't, because that's lame, but I think it validates your proposed model somewhat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222198">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222198/#Comment_222198" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-03T09:28:09+00:00" title="August  3, 2009  9:28AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan, I always wondered why Geiger Counter wasn't available for sale yet.

I anticipate offering other future games for free as well. <br/><br/>I have a specific model planned. Currency is not changing hands. But, value is. <br/><br/>Obviously, an interested person gets value in a free game that's worth a darn. (I like to think my designs are worth at least 1 darn.) And, <i>in general</i> the quality of publications/products of free RPGs to date isn't spectacular. I hope to raise that bar a bit.<br/><br/>But, I can also get value from that interested person. Which is exactly what I intend to do, above board. <br/><br/>My plan is to construct a relationship base with my free "customers." They continue to access / download / whatever my free games. I continue to have a relationship with them, primarily via my website and regular email updates. I keep them informed of future releases, they keep coming back to my website and maybe evangelizing my game to others.<br/><br/>Building the system to accomodate this isn't a total cinch, but it isn't technically difficult either. <br/><br/>Writing and designing the games is fun but time consuming. <br/><br/>Paying for artwork boils down to my main cost. I do intend to have artwork in upcoming designs. (44 already has very little artwork, but that's ok.) And, likely, I'll just pay for it. That's that. Consider it an experiment. <br/><br/>Now, can I translate this value exchange into something that isn't an expensive hobby for me? I don't know. I am not dead set, forever and ever, against charging money, or seeking donations. Maybe a ransom model once I build up a level of appeciation among some.

That's nice and all, but a lot of that ideological stuff doesn't really matter once the shit you create hits the fan of actual publishing. Personally, I like money and fame just as much (or more) than the average joe, but commercial publishing just wasn't working for me even when it was working relatively well (Push 1, development of some other stuff), for a number of reasons that I won't really go into here.<br/><br/>And honestly that's what got me really looking at free, though sometimes I cloaked my intentions in Shirkey / OpenSpeak.  But, realistically, that's justification after the fact.  The truth of the manner is that, as much as you might want to do free for ideological reasons, it may not work for you when you actually get around to doing it.  Or, from the other perspective, even if you publish a game for money and fame (as opposed to, uh, non-money and fame), it might not be satisfying in the ways you expected.  Ultimately, in the end, you have to do what works for you, whether it's leaving copies of your games on the street for people to find or making custom hand-made copies that sell for hundreds of dollars each.<br/><br/>Personally, I'm doing something right now that works for me or, at least, works better than the other things I've tried before.  But if I find a new model that works better for me in the future (free or commercial or whatever), based on where I'm at then, then I'll do that instead.  So... basically... do what makes you happiest or is the most functional.  If the way you're approaching publishing or design or play or whatever is making you miserable, try different things until you find something that works better.  You don't need to be stuck thinking that there's only one or two (or five or ten) ways to do something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222310/#Comment_222310" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-03T16:56:08+00:00" title="August  3, 2009  4:56PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome post!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222313">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222313/#Comment_222313" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-03T17:26:29+00:00" title="August  3, 2009  5:26PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: tony dowler</cite>Do you give away your game for free?

Many people have played and enjoyed it.  I've made great new friends through that.  I'm not sure if it was part of Matt Wilson's decision to offer to do the layout, but because it was freely available, an illustrator in Italy played and loved it, and now is going to do lots of art for it.  Some other people in Italy who run a gaming board already are translating the (50,000-word) beta. So who knows where this goes when a purchasable edition is done, but what I care most about already has happened: people play the game and have fun.  And it's become a much better game for it by now.<br/><br/>And that experience, in turn, is part of why I released the Beast Hunters SRD for free.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222324">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222324/#Comment_222324" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-03T19:50:00+00:00" title="August  3, 2009  7:50PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As Christian notes, I think there were a number of folks -- starting, perhaps, with Clinton -- who found that, whatever publishing model we followed the first time around -- inspired by what we thought Ron and other folks were doing -- wasn't as fulfilling as we'd hoped. And that's really interesting because Ron and Vincent and Luke, for example, have changed their publishing / distribution models a number of times (early days, Forge booth, IPR, UnStore, closed development, open development, etc.), so really they were coming to the same conclusion before us, with different models. Personally, I followed what I thought was "THE model" (short paperback print run, IPR, GenCon) when, in truth, there were a number of models (that model was, in fact, about a year old) and there are still new models being developed all the time. Honestly, even the folks that you would think have small press publishing down are still shifting around and others, like Paul Czege, are sticking with older models (selling directly through his website, period) that work for them. It took me way too long to realize this, but the idea that there are clear methods of self-publishing RPGs is an illusion. Really, there are dozens of different methods that have been tried and most folks choose from a number of them and adapt based on circumstances and experiences. Honestly, Clinton probably knew that from the beginning, but I definitely didn't.<br/><br/>(Sorry for the drifting, but since Tony's talking about changing publication models, I thought it was pertinent).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222326">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222326/#Comment_222326" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-03T20:00:06+00:00" title="August  3, 2009  8:00PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            yes, publishing models are certainly a propos: "free"ness seems to go hand-in-hand with your publishing model and what you want out of your publication.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222398">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jared%20A.%20Sorensen" title="Jared A.

So that's good.  It seems to be a designer's game. Releasing it for free means I can focus on just the stuff I care about in the game, and not think so much about packaging it as a product, the customer's expectations and rights, etc. I would never make a lot of money off it anyway. I am considering putting it up for sale once I feel I have nothing more to contribute to that specific avenue of design, but I have no specific plans.<br/><br/>The N\xf8rwegian Style book has caused people to actually read Fuck Youth, which nobody seemed to do as long as it was just for free on the blog. <br/><br/>Zombie Porn has been downloaded by a lot of people, but I don't think anyone outside Norway has actually had the balls to play it.<br/><br/>A Trip to the Moon has been read by a handful of people, who seem to like it. I love that game with a warm fuzzy feeling.<br/><br/>Oh! Goals. Fame, mostly.

Not just beta/gamma to commercial release but completed free games.
