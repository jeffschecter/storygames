And as the resident "Indie Guy", he approached me to write the blurbs for his website. Now, for half of the games (Reign, Monsters and PtA), that's not a problem as I know and like them. (So I can also sell them well, I think.)<br/><br/>But I only know the basics about Best Friends, WGP and Trail of Cthulhu, so I'm looking for more info on them, especially hands-on experience, actual play and general "I played/ran/read this and [Part X] was TOTALLY AWESOME!!!"-type information. Anything that gives me a better idea of what cool stuff they bring to the table.<br/><br/>Thanks in advance. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139450">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139450/#Comment_139450" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-12T20:11:17+00:00" title="April 12, 2008  8:11PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let's see. Trail of Cthulhu is an update of Call of Cthulhu, written by Ken Hite. It's got lots of stuff about the Mythos, which I think is bloody good. Every Mythos entity has multiple options of what it <i>might</i> be: they're explained in terms of physics, myths and so on.<br/><br/>It uses the GUMSHOE system, which means you spend points instead of rolling dice. You're guaranteed to uncover the mystery: the question is, how does it affect you? The rules for Sanity and Stability are great: Sanity is How Unaware You Are Of The True Nature Of The Universe; Stability is How Well You Are Keeping Your Shit Together. You can be a raving mad cultist but appear calm on the surface.<br/><br/>I ran it at Conpulsion. It's great. It handles Purist Lovecraftian stuff very well: going mad when faced with unknowable horror. I had all the players narrating character endings (they sobbed at the edge of a beach, ran until they couldn't run any more, and so on). Not bad for a convention game.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_139451">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139451/#Comment_139451" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-12T20:14:15+00:00" title="April 12, 2008  8:14PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And...Best Friends is a game about "girlfriends and their petty hatreds". It's very cool. The best things are:<br/><br/>* Your attributes are chosen by the other players.<br/>* Part of the game is choosing a setting and it handles the switch between settings really well.<br/>* You're friends but you squabble, and that's fun.<br/><br/>I ran that at a convention, too. It was superb. We did a Buffy-style thing: all the players got really into choosing the setting exactly ("Like Scooby-Doo, but not as cheesy. So a bit like Buffy.")<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139466">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139466/#Comment_139466" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-13T03:16:23+00:00" title="April 13, 2008  3:16AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Trail looks pretty sweet...

I can't honestly remember a time I've devoured an RPG book so quickly... it's really well-written, and very tightly-focussed on the game style that it's aiming at. The system has been mentioned in a previous post, but what I really went for is the background... a step-by-step guide to plotting an investigative adventure, multiple mythos interpretations, and a "Nightmare Countries" full of rumours about Antartica, the Belgian Congo, and other far-off locales. It also includes rules for something called Anagnorisis, for the 'big reveal' in purist lovecraft stories when the characters realise the utter pointlessness of their quest. It's pretty harsh, but oozes flavour and story-game potential (kinda like the way Dust Devils plots your characters' downfall as the campaign's climax). But it is, as many of the Purist/Pulp elements are, an optional rule.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt also contains Call of Cthulhu conversion notes (pretty comprehensive ones) and a sample adventure which I found, just reading it over, genuinely creepy. I wasn't sure about the Esoterrorists, the GUMSHOE first release that uses the same system, but I fell for Trail.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139531">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139531/#Comment_139531" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-13T16:08:05+00:00" title="April 13, 2008  4:08PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's my "Awesomez!" thread on WGP:<br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4620" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4620</a><br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_139554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139554/#Comment_139554" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-14T02:13:28+00:00" title="April 14, 2008  2:13AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks people.

Like how The Hulk loses control before taking on the bad guy, or how Spider-Man pisses off Mary Jane in the pursuit of justice. The built in mechanics push for comic book story arcs, and it really helps bring in all the fun, pathos, melodrama, cheesey dialog, and mythic stories that we love about them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
