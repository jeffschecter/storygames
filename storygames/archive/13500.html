Maybe a single thread can't handle it.  Maybe it will cause acrimony.  But I'm trying it anyway.  I'll start:<br/><br/>In our otherwise awesome AW game, the gunlugger and the maestro disguise themselves so they can leave the hardhold without being caught by the hardholder's gang.  The gunlugger gives the maestro her hat, and the gunlugger makes a "coolness under fire" roll (where the fire is being discovered) and the maestro helps.  The maestro gets the 7-9 and the gunlugger succeeds - so the MC rules that the maestro gives the guards the gunlugger's hat to distract them - that's the exposure.  I'm playing the maestro, and I'm just a little off-put that I lost control of my character for a second, but I'm a good sport about it and say, "Sure, I do that."  And it leads to a lot of fun later, both in banter between the maestro and the gunlugger and also when the gunlugger later goes to get their hat back, so what am I complaining about?  <br/><br/>Still - how would you have played it?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_304731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304731/#Comment_304731" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-15T20:47:13+00:00" title="December 15, 2010  8:47PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting. I'm totally cool with people dumping their experiences in this thread, or else dedicating a new thread to it, even if they multiply all over the site. <br/><br/>Anyway, as most RPG problems are communications problems, here's likely what would have happened at my table. I can almost see the experience in my head:<br/><br/>If I were the gunlugger, from the start I would have turned to you and said, "Is that okay? Did you have a better idea?" I do this frequently as a player when I'm about to "make them do something for me".<br/><br/>As Maestro, I can see Matthew G at our table (for some reason he as a player's voice is coming through here) after being told by the MC what happens, would basically: <br/><br/>Pause, pretending to be looking at his character sheet.<br/>Pretend that he was distracted/looking elsewhere, that he "switched gears" back to the game, and say in a cheerful voice,<br/>"Oh wait, what is my character doing again?"<br/>or<br/>"I'm sorry, what are you having my character do?"<br/>or some variant, being kinda funny-melodramatic about it to clearly indicate, "I'm not pissed or anything, this is totally fine/funny with me. But you do realize that you just grabbed my dude, right?"<br/>and follow it up with a laugh.<br/><br/>That's what Matt would have done, anyway. I probably would have just did what you did. :-)<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_304785">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan_Conway" title="Brendan_Conway"><img alt="Brendan_Conway" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan_Conway">Brendan_Conway</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304785/#Comment_304785" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-16T06:36:46+00:00" title="December 16, 2010  6:36AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 16, 2010 10:34AM by Brendan_Conway.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not entirely sure how appropriate it is for me to be commenting, because I was in the game, but that being said, yeah, maybe the best response would have been to just either ask right away, or to automatically reinterpret what was said? "Oh, so he wants Jericho's hat? Well, I have to think about whether I'll give it to him." I can definitely see why you wouldn't have been terribly fond of that particular moment; I can only say from my perspective, the moment in question seemed to fly by without a terribly great opportunity to do anything about it. <br/><br/>I'm going to echo your situation with a similar one of my own, though. To be clear from right off the bat, my feelings about this situation are confused and mixed, thoroughly, because it's simultaneously wonderful story fodder, and somewhat problematic for me. <br/><br/>In another AW game I'm in, there came a time for MC love letters. Mine was for a Brainer who had been laid up in bed after being exploded, and so he was healing. The love letter was great, and for the most part, it was actually really positive and beneficial for me. It used weird to roll, in which I had a +3, and the possible results had their elements of nastiness (like "find out what this person has been doing," which is good because I know, but bad because they've been doing something), which just made them all the more interesting. But, I botched the roll, and failed. The move, at its outset, had made clear that if I failed the roll, I would wake up somewhere, seeing something, and I wouldn't like it. Ultimately, it turned out that I had slaughtered the entire brothel of the hardhold, except for one girl, with whom I was infatuated. It made sense because I had previously found out that there was a very evil, nasty ghost/soul/thing clinging to me, attached to me, and so the explanation was that it had just possessed me and done the murders to get me to do what it wanted. <br/><br/>Excellent plot fodder, because it certainly has resulted in a tremendous amount of action, but here's my issue: the entire story of this character is now oriented towards dealing with the repercussions of this roll, entirely, absolutely, with nary an opening for anything else. And I the player did not explicitly choose to make this roll, like I would have if it were for another move instead of for an MC love letter. Furthermore, I, the character, did not actually do anything, because I was possessed, so I lost agency, albeit in a much more fictionally explicable way than in Jamie's example. So really, what it feels like to me is that my story has taken a definite turn for tension and driving action...but only because something happened to me, not because of me. Does that make sense? I like it, because of all the drama it has brought, and I dislike it, because I had no role in actually causing that drama; it was entirely out of my hands. We're way too far down the road to do anything about it, and I really wouldn't even choose to change it if I could; it really is quite juicy and interesting. But my cognitive dissonance over the matter still bugs me, and I'm wondering if anyone has any thoughts on maybe what I should've done, or if I should get over myself, or anything.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_304817">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason" title="Joe_Beason"><img alt="Joe_Beason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason">Joe_Beason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304817/#Comment_304817" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-16T08:21:33+00:00" title="December 16, 2010  8:21AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Both cases could be helped by more player input.

Then have the player state how they distracted or what they saw.  If they're stuck for ideas, make suggestions, or elicit suggestions from the other players, but give them some volition.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_305237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cathexis" title="cathexis"><img alt="cathexis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cathexis">cathexis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305237/#Comment_305237" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-20T11:54:56+00:00" title="December 20, 2010 11:54AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I go with the Burning Wheel rule of describing your actions.

She points out that when she tried to talk during the game, she was interrupted by the same player numerous times. Now, when I'm in GM Mode, my head is often buzzing about so I don't pick up player conflict as much as player character conflict, so I cannot say I really "got" those moments. But they existed for her and they hurt her fun and I missed it, which increases the suckitude.<br/><br/>I asked her if she wanted to take the player aside and discuss it with him, but she said she didn't think it would help anything, she doesn't think she likes playing with this group, doesn't feel her contributions are noted or valued. I feel this may be the beginning of the end for this group and game. <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305705/#Comment_305705" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-23T09:19:19+00:00" title="December 23, 2010  9:19AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            orklord, were you looking for feedback?
