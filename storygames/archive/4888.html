As it turns out, it's quite a design challenge--it's much easier to tie in reward and/or penalty systems when each player has an entity (their character) that their influence in the game is permanently attached to.<br/><br/>So, the question is: <br/><br/>How does your Fun increase, decrease, or change based on how much character-identification is present in the game, whether for you or for other players?<br/><br/>For instance, maybe you really enjoy games more when you can feel like "you're really there", and sense the thrill of danger to your character vicariously. Or maybe you can't enjoy an RPG if your character could potentially die before the game is over. On the other hand, maybe you have more fun as a GM because the other players have an alter ego, and you can try to get to them by throwing situation at the character? <br/><br/>As a secondary question, has moving along this continuum of "full character identification" to "no character identification" brough you any sort of Cosmic Wisdom about game design?<br/><br/>Finally, I read that Vincent Baker has written somewhere why he strongly prefers games where players portray characters over games which just "tell stories". I'd love to read this (or even a paraphrase), but can't find it.

For me character identification doesn't have to be prolonged in order to be fun. I slip very easily in and out of role, which is something I think most gamemasters do. For others it's not quite the same, see below. \n<blockquote>As a secondary question, has moving along this continuum of "full character identification" to "no character identification" brough you any sort of Cosmic Wisdom about game design?</blockquote>\nI wish. The question of character and authority has gotten me into a bit of a dilemma.

I hope this isn't hijacking the thread, I bring this up because I think it's an example of the tension between character identification and distributed authority. <br/><br/>We recently converted a Dogs in the Jedi campaign into Primetime Adventures, and one of the two players told me after the first session that he didn't like the play experience. I actually had a sneaking suspicion from the start that he might hate it because he enjoys character immersion, but hoped he would discover the awesome once he tried it. When he did, though, he felt that taking so much narrative control took away from the experience. Fair enough, he gave it a fair try and didn't like it, and I appreciate his honesty. (In other words I feel a bit resentful, but that's another thread.)<br/><br/>It's a bit of a quandary because of my reasons for the conversion in the first place. The campaign we converted was a kind of informal spin-off from another DitV campaign, mostly kept going by the two players being really into their characters. I don't have the time or energy to prep and iron out continuities for two campaigns and the main point of the spin-off was the characters anyway, so I suggested killing two birds with one stone by converting to a system that a) requires almost nothing in the way of prep and b) is extremely character-driven. <br/><br/>Therefore, unless there's a way to both distribute the authority and the burden away from me and to fulfill the player's need for more character immersion, that spin-off is basically dead in the water. For some, definitely, having the broader view is a deal-breaker.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_109691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cydmab" title="cydmab"><img alt="cydmab" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cydmab">cydmab</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109691/#Comment_109691" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-26T14:15:59+00:00" title="November 26, 2007  2:15PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know if this qualifies as "cosmic wisdom" but one thing I've noticed is that strong property rights (like strong authority over character) encourage "investment," including between session investment.

Personally, I found games that lie in the middle of the continuum awkward. When playing DitV, PtA, and Polaris, there were various strong temptations by myself and other members of my group to abandon any character focus whatsoever. Two people complained in DitV that they had to ground narration for  sees and raises in terms of their character. Several of us wondered why there was a producer-player distinction in PtA; why not have everyone be a producer, and have a pool of characters anyone could draw on? We've had repeated problems in Polaris of people ignoring restrictions on "free play" to respect cosmos ownership of the characters. (Moons spontaneously narrating demons, etc.) One player has made multiple requests that we house-rule away those restrictions. <br/><br/>I personally think this is because I'm used to two ways of playing - as a player and as a GM. As a player it's almost 100% character focus, almost anything (with certain specific exceptions) done "out of character" is extremely frowned upon. As a GM though I have the opposite ethic - all NPCs are pawns to be used or abused in service of entertaining the players and oneself. I have 20 years of experience with these two perspectives.

One of the players has no GMing experience and is often shy and hesitant about playing even her own character; the other has GMed once but far prefers playing because he likes to play his character. One sign of this was that a GMPC kept cropping up when he ran that one game, a flaw he freely admits. <br/><br/>The shy player was the one who ended up with narration in the first conflict we ran, and after ten excruciating minutes of hesitant silence, during which I told her more than once she can ask for suggestions if she's stuck, I finally offered to take over and give her veto authority and the ability to add to the narration. She was happy to jump right back into character, and added a fact to the narration as well. (She asked if one of the assassins whose stabbing I'd just described could survive a while longer, then narrated the assassin's death under her character's grinding foot. Whoa.) <br/><br/>It seems, in the end, that both these players are much happier playing characters and affecting parts of the narration as it relates to them, rather than taking authority over the overall story.

It's not like the GM's going to go, "Nah, I don't want that to happen next. Pick something else." I mean, they might, but if they do, I think that GM needs to be solidly struck with a mackerel across the face a few times.<br/><br/>Same thing with narrating conflict stuff - I think almost every GM's turned that over to the player at some point and gone, "Okay, so you kill him. How do you do it?" And in a group with good communication, the players might offer up side details like, "Oh, sweet, the king has a magic sword... it should totally be encrusted with gems and just be crazy-looking, like it's a status symbol as well." Not all the time, but sometimes, and usually a GM will take that kind of stuff and say, "Okay, sure, we'll say that's true."<br/><br/>And I'm not really sure what it is about PTA that makes people tend not to drift the rules when they run into those awkwardnesses, like people do with nearly any game, nearly all the time. I mean, I've played a ton of Vampire where the players had lots of say over story and narration on the meta-level, and I've played some PTA that was basically the most rules-light traditional game ever. It strikes me that often, the character ownership / actor stance thing is more about <i>ignoring</i> other kinds of authority than actually lacking them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_109918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109918/#Comment_109918" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-27T20:27:49+00:00" title="November 27, 2007  8:27PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting comments about PtA: my best "traditional" role-playing experience was one where I, as GM, very consciously tried to include as much player input as possible.

Now I'm wondering if <i>they</i> thought that doing this in PTA was more fun, less fun, or about the same amount of fun as doing it as the GM in one of our traditional games.  I honestly don't know what their answer to that would be.  More fun because they don't have to do it all the time?  Less fun because they <i>don't</i> do it all the time?  More fun because they can stay in the moment and go with whatever pops into their head, trusting that other people will keep things moving afterwards?  Less fun because they feel like they could've done a better job than whoever actually "won" the narration last time?  The same, because it's the same process and the context doesn't matter?  Did they feel the same way about scene framing, or acting as a PTA "writer" and generating most of the show's content with minimal input from the Producer?  <br/><br/>(I didn't bother asking because, honestly, the game was so despised by half of the group that I knew we were never going to bother trying it again, so why dwell on something that didn't work for us when I could be looking forward to something that does work?

A whole mess of successful gaming relies on constructive denial over one thing or another.<br/><br/>Back to that immersive guy I was talking about, who would sometimes step out and correct or add details or whatnot in play. I can tell that this person has no clue how often he does that when he plays, because it happens when he's in the zone, and he's not really thinking about it - he does it reflexively, as a byproduct of his immersion. I'm also sure that if I ever brought it up to him, he'd a.) flatly (and honestly, to his mind) deny it, b.) get self-conscious and defensive about it, and/or c.) be mildly horrified. And next game, he'd be thinking about it way too consciously, and it'd fuck up his mojo.<br/><br/>That guy doesn't want to know how much meta-game influence he exerts, or even could exert. Knowing ruins some of the experience for him. So it goes beyond the realm of "as long as I don't have to do it, it's cool" to "if I do it without knowing, don't even tell me".\n<blockquote>(I didn't bother asking because, honestly, the game was so despised by half of the group that I knew we were never going to bother trying it again, so why dwell on something that didn't work for us when I could be looking forward to something that does work?

But, if you can get away with the half or third of the group that did like the experience, and play the game again with just them, I think you should - if only to resolve some of your curiosity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_109960">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cydmab" title="cydmab"><img alt="cydmab" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cydmab">cydmab</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109960/#Comment_109960" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-28T06:20:57+00:00" title="November 28, 2007  6:20AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of my theories for why Polaris works better for me than PTA/DitV/Bliss Stage is while Polaris does impose narrative Responsibilities, I can choose scene by scene which set of Responsibilities I am willing to undertake, the Moon roles are almost zero-Responsibility functions, and I can abandon Heart or Mistaken Responsibilities at will by ending the scene at any time.

I like when my fellow players do the same - a big part of the pleasure of participating in Soraya's story, for instance, was participating in <i>Emily's portrayal</i> of Soraya.<br/><br/>If each character has one player primarily responsible for her, that creates an intimacy between the character and the player that I enjoy a lot, whether I'm that player or that player's audience.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_110046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110046/#Comment_110046" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-28T11:08:11+00:00" title="November 28, 2007 11:08AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow!

I felt closer to the people at the table. Does that ring true or false with anybody?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
