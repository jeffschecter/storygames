Simon's my friend, I've been playtesting Nod since the start, and I'm a big fan of the game. I love the dark sword-and-sorcery stories that it creates. I love the fact that as you create the barbarian's story of their hunt for their quarry, you're also creating a much bigger story about the intrigues and power-plays in the city (these come about through using the agendas that each character has).<br/><br/>The Stuff to Watch thread mentioned Dirty Secrets as a possible influence on or cousin of Nod (due to its asymmetry: one PC player and many NPC/GM players). From playing with Simon over the last couple of years, there's a couple of other influences I think I can see.<br/><br/>The biggest might be Wicked Archipelago (Jamie Fristrom's mash-up of In a Wicked Age and Archipelago) and the way Nod uses Authorities.<br/><br/>I played a fun game of S/Lay w/Me with Simon at a pub once, and Nod's loose and do-what's-exciting take on sword and sorcery reminds me of that game.<br/><br/>Apocalypse World's character creation is obviously in there too.<br/><br/>And there's On Mighty Thews, which Simon wrote and once told me he'd do completely differently if he was starting from scratch.<br/><br/>Has anyone else played it or read it and has thoughts on how the game works? Simon: you want to share any insights?<br/><br/>(Oh, and the rules for Nod are available for free here: <a href="http://forgottennod.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/nod_rulebook.pdf" rel="nofollow">.pdf download</a> .

I'd go to conventions and get this hankering after this nebulous idea of a game, floating at the edge of reality. <br/><br/>It started with just one scene, really: A lone protagonist stalking down a dim alleyway in a huge and foreign city. Shingle rooftops with long eaves crowd overhead. In the darkness multiple enemies maneuver and scheme.<br/><br/>That scene was accompanied by a sense of how I wanted play to feel: Spontaneous, dangerous, no one sure what was going to happen next, each player surprising and delighting the others with the things they say.<br/><br/>Nod was my attempt to make that game real.<br/><br/>Now, in doing that I absolutely drew on previous games I'd played. That game of Wicked Archipelago was definitely in there. I've not played Archipelago or In a Wicked Age, so I don't really know which of those games to credit, but what I really liked from that game was the distribution of authorities around the table. It felt easy and natural to pass off narration and authorities to other players as play moved into their territory.<br/><br/>What I liked about that was that it gave players the opportunity to develop a really strong <i>aesthetic</i> for their contributions. What I've found also is that players find it much easier to create good strong contributions to the fiction when they have limited but clear and complete authority over the thing they're creating. This is tied to a thing Vincent said about how being able to trust your vision helps contribute to the strength of connection to the fiction.<br/><br/>S/Lay w/Me is an interesting one. I don't think that was a direct influence, except in the sense that it helped convince me that it was possible to create a game that more closely hearkened to Sword and Sorcery <i>literature</i>, rather than just introducing some S&amp;S tropes to the traditional RPG dynamic. In particular, the lone protagonist I think is a pretty essential part of how the game feels.<br/><br/>I don't think there's a credible RPG designer around who isn't at least a little influenced by Apocalypse World. In this case though I don't think the character creation was so much an influence. They're superficially very similar, but I think that's more a case of convergent evolution than direct influence. Vincent did not invent choosing things from lists! The biggest influence from Apocalypse World is more on the structure of the explicit agendas for the characters, and the principles of play which appear in the rulebook. I think if it were not for Apocalypse World I would not have had the language or insight to so clearly express those concepts.<br/><br/>Tangentially, I think the D&amp;D I've been playing was a big influence too. I think experience playing a game with a really clear and functional creative agenda teaches you a huge amount about how good play should feel - how every moment in play can contribute towards a meaningful experience. Playing a huge amount of really functional D&amp;D raised my standards hugely in terms of what I expect play to be like. The actual creative agendas of the games are wildly different, but I think they have a lot in common in terms of being ruthlessly focused on serving a very particular creative agenda.<br/><br/>I hope that's useful and interesting, Steve. I'd really love to hear others' opinions on this though.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433545">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/moleculo" title="moleculo"><img alt="moleculo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/874/n4G37MA34HKP8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/moleculo">moleculo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433545/#Comment_433545" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-07T09:42:18+00:00" title="June  7, 2014  9:42AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 7, 2014 9:44AM by moleculo.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simon, please elaborate on what you mean by "really clear and functional creative agenda" and especially how that relates to D&amp;D.

Crucially, it means that when I do something in the game that makes it more fun for me, that also makes it more fun for you.<br/><br/>That's really easy to demonstrate in D&amp;D (by which I should specify, I mean the particular variant of "old school" D&amp;D I play, functionally similar to White Box, or OD&amp;D).<br/><br/>In this D&amp;D, play is about the players overcoming challenges by using tactical skill as well as intuition and calculated risk. The DM is an impartial arbiter of their efforts. In a good game of D&amp;D, all play is relevant to that agenda. By which I mean that when play is functioning well, every decision the players make is on some level a tactical decision - a decision that will have bearing on whether they overcome a particular challenge. Sometimes these relationships can be distant and tangential, like inventing details of your character's background and history. In really functional play though, even these seemingly inconsequential details are given weight by the fact that they might, at some stage, come to influence the outcome of a challenge.<br/><br/>In this D&amp;D, it would be irrelevant and distracting for two characters to have a conversation about the ethics of what they do. That's not to say that we don't make ethical judgements about the characters' actions, just that those judgements aren't relevant to play and aren't given much attention during the game.<br/><br/>The reason this became so relevant to making my game Nod is that it gave me a lot of experience of play where every event is relevant to the creative agenda. It meant that I could pare out anything that didn't serve the purpose of answering the central question of play.<br/><br/>What is the central question of Nod? It's right in the opening premise. The Barbarian is hunting their quarry. Will they succeed? Should they succeed? How will this journey change them? What if they discover something even more important? This premise is very much part of the game design. It's hard for play to meander off the point when you have a motivated protagonist with a clear goal and a limited time frame.<br/><br/>If you look at the character cards in Nod, you'll see that almost every character's agenda, authorities, and especially their twist, directs play back towards answering the central questions. In play, this means that everything that happens becomes relevant to the Barbarian's mission, either to whether they succeed, or to judging whether they <i>should</i> succeed.<br/><br/>I hope that helps answer your question! I'm really glad the game looks good to you, and I'd love to hear how it goes when you play.<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/><br/>Simon                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433550">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith" title="Keith"><img alt="Keith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/41781_139848736039153_8022_q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith">Keith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433550/#Comment_433550" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-07T15:42:11+00:00" title="June  7, 2014  3:42PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nod looks really exciting to me.
