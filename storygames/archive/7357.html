Usually, the important part (for my money) is to flag people to consider it as a possible "Woah" moment, and then let them choose their own length of silence, using social cues more deeply encoded in our makeup than any game is likely to supplant.<br/>\n<br/>\nExample:  I had a game in which I was using a "raise a finger for silence" rule, and someone said (of a rival political figure in a decadent court) "Oh, that man will be the <i>death</i> of me!"  I raised a finger, and one by one around the table people went from "Hey, what's Tony pausing us for?" to "Oh shit ... what if she's <b>right</b>?"  Once everyone saw that everyone had got it, any further silence would (in that case) have been unnecessary.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_163435">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163435/#Comment_163435" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-19T17:38:25+00:00" title="August 19, 2008  5:38PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JD and Tony,<br>I love how those two techniques are the inverse of one another.

I think this was what Jason was alluding to.<br/><br/>But when we playtested it, Jackson Tegu noted that as the person who was watching the clock, it was difficult for him to really relax and take advantage of the silent break.<br/><br/>So in the <a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/games//believers/believers_01.pdf" rel="nofollow">revised</a> version of the game, each player simply places a hand on the table when they are done contemplating.  The game continues when everyone has a hand on the table.  I playtested this again recently with a small three player game, and it worked much smoother.  And the break still ended up being around 45-50 seconds long.<br/><br/>After having played <i>The Believers</i> several times, I think this enforced break is a powerful part of the game and sets the mood for the alien visitation to occur next.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_163686">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

That seemed to work well. I've only experienced this a few times though. But yeah, when I forget to do something (whether it's a "knowing nod" trying to express, "hold up here, I'm in character still") sometimes someone else will jump in with a line trying to help me out. <br/><br/>But in general, I do the finger thing.

Really, the worst thing that happens here is other players get annoyed waiting for their turn or something.<br/><br/>It's more that if you're running through stuff in your head and somebody tries to engage you, you tend to lose your place and get annoyed, right?

I was this conflicted senior: gay, but in the closet; film geek, but dad is forcin' him to join the track team; brilliant, but a complete outcast. And there was this moment where my ex-girlfriend (the only one in the school who I'd come out to) threatens to tell everyone in an act of petty revenge, and I knew that my character would have this savage, SAVAGE biting remark. But I'm not as quick as he is, so I said "give me a minute". People threw out suggestions, but I said "give me a minute" again and they held their piece. And then I got it (!), and I resumed character and delivered this powerful, grabby line. And it was way better than whatever would have filled that space, and it worked because I commanded both their patience and their attention.<br/><br/>I think the two lines were along the lines of...<br/>Ex-girlfriend: Hey, I really like this guy in the drama club, but he might be gay. I was wondering... since you're gay... maybe if you could... figure it out?<br/>(long, pregnant thinking pause)<br/>My emo kid: Listen, you're the expert on dating gay guys, not me.<br/><br/>Which doesn't read like anything much, because it's mostly context and inflection... but I tore her fictional ass to shreds with that one.<br/><br/>To clarify, this is an example of when *commanding a silence* was crucial, not of a specifically effective technique for doing so.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_163957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163957/#Comment_163957" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-21T01:10:06+00:00" title="August 21, 2008  1:10AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 21, 2008 1:15AM by TomasHVM.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: joepub</cite>Tomas,<br/>I'm highly intrigued about "no mucking about" being a communicated piece of... your social contract.

After they give me the OK on this, we will commence play.<br/><br/>Does that sound ok to you?<br/><br/>And by the way: I do not consider it part of the "social contract". People tend to talk too much of this "contract", and putting too much of the game method into it. In my view the "social contract" pertains to playing for fun in a RPG, and playing for victory in a boardgame. That's about it. The agreement to play low-key and serious is part of the game method, in my view. :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
