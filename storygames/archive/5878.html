Just started, we've got characters, <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=5726" rel="nofollow">we've got a stable of NPCs</a> (or possible future PCs if some NPCs kick it), which bring their own stories to the yard.<br/><br/>I've been tweaking the L5R system a little (just one way, actually: This is 1st edition) to turn the Death Spiral into a "Happy Plateau/'This is my FINAL FORM!'/I'm Dead!"...spiral. The rest of the rules are good as-is. I'm taking an original character sheet, and hand-editing the wound boxes to make it Right.<br/><br/>Now, I'm thinking of a little something else to add, without going as far as "ditch it and use TSOY": I want to add some "personality" to the characters. Check out Matthew (a member of my group)'s comments from Mike Holmes' WoW thread:\n<blockquote>When I look at the character sheet in a trad game, I'm looking for cues or flags, and a lot of trad games don't have them (or have weak ones) - I know what my L5R character is capable of doing, in the same way that I know what spells my WoW character knows, but I'm often at a loss for an agenda for my L5R character.</blockquote>\nHere's some simple things I was thinking:<br/><br/>1) Create a little text box to WRITE YOUR AGENDA/GOALS on. No funky dice, no rules, just an in-your-face box so that you get a feel for and remember your character's "Issue".<br/><br/>2) Spiritual Attributes. This is a simple hax for L5R: Maybe say "You have 5 points of spiritual attributes: Trip one, and you get that number of dice to roll (not keep)". <br/><br/>3) "What is Best in Life, Conan?" Tracks. Each character has 3 tracks called "What is Best in Life": Basically Goals, but they can be really vague ("Honor", "Glory", "Passion", "Revenge"). Whenever you do something towards one of those goals, get a check. When 5 checks have been made in one track, an Advance is made (xp: bump an attribute, skill, etc).<br/><br/>Other thoughts? This is kinda weird, because it's like you don't need to be intimately familiar with how the game works, but some familiarity might help make better suggestions.<br/><br/>(chargen guidelines: <a href="http://laeren.zoggins.net/rpg/l5r/ref/generation.php" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://laeren.zoggins.net/rpg/l5r/ref/generation.php</a> ; <a href="http://www.rpgsheets.com/sheets/Legend%20of%20the%20Five%20Rings/Legend%20of%20the%20Five%20Rings.pdf" rel="nofollow">1st Edition Character Sheet</a> )<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131568">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr" title="Kevin Allen Jr"><img alt="Kevin Allen Jr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr">Kevin Allen Jr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131568/#Comment_131568" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-29T07:20:10+00:00" title="February 29, 2008  7:20AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            well, i recently did something akin to this, but i was using the newest edition (sorry wick, these clean up a lot of the messes you made). I did however play during 1st Ed's timeline. I did a lot of the mountain witch trick, and players really responded to that. <br/><br/>I also did a very awkward duel of wits using the "focus... focus... strike!" rules. It wasn't as tight as it could have been because we kind of did it spur of the moment. We discovered, rather annoyingly that there is no way for a bushi to mechanically convince someone they are right without drawing a sword. You pretty much have to take courtier if your going to speak. I don't think that really helps the game very much so we had word duels. I would clean it up before using it again.<br/><br/>I think a neat story gamey thing would be giving players rewards for following the 7 laws and being flummoxed by the 7 laws of bushido.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_131577">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131577/#Comment_131577" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-29T07:32:01+00:00" title="February 29, 2008  7:32AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe it's just me, or just story gamers, but I am flummoxed by players not knowing what their characters are about.

I mean, it's up to them!<br/><br/>Now flagging those to the GM is a different matter.<br/><br/>Of course L5R has quite strong stereotypes about how each clan and family and school act, and it might work well just to play to those. That assumes strong familiarity with the storyline of course. I know just fine how an Otaku (as opposed to Utaku) battle maiden would normally act, and what would hit their buttons, but your players may not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthew%20D.%20Gandy" title="Matthew D.

I am vaguely familiar with my clan, as presented by Andy, but I have not read the books, nor do I expect to. So what I have is what's on my character sheet.<br/><br/>My character sheet tells me <i>part </i>of who my character is (name, clan) and what my character is good at or capable of, but nothing about what my character <i>wants</i>. I could play the character as a stereotypical member of his clan, but he's not - he's male (in a matriarchal clan) and a bit of a slow learner, and I find I enjoy playing against type quite often.<br/><br/>Currently, I see two things: first, he sees himself as a tool of his clan (in a good sense - he does what his clan asks of him, without question), and second, he doesn't know what <i>he </i>wants. If there's anything agend-y or flag-like, it's that <i>I</i> want him to find out what <i>he </i>wants during play. I don't think he knows, himself, honestly.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the game system does not mechanically support that, which is a major reason why most trad games don't grab me any more. I'm using the excuse of being a slow learner in an unfamiliar environment (he's been sent to the Wall) to cover my own ignorance as a player. It also helps that I like emergent play, so I hope to understand the character more as I play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_131770">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131770/#Comment_131770" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-29T16:00:26+00:00" title="February 29, 2008  4:00PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ditch Honor and Glory, and have a personalized track, based on what the character views as being important- pick, for example, maybe four of the seven bushido virtues, and make hewing to those mechanically relevant, instead of the fiat-cesspool that is the Honor track.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131888">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131888/#Comment_131888" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-01T09:31:25+00:00" title="March  1, 2008  9:31AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Willow</cite>Ditch Honor and Glory, and have a personalized track, based on what the character views as being important- pick, for example, maybe four of the seven bushido virtues, and make hewing to those mechanically relevant, instead of the fiat-cesspool that is the Honor track.</blockquote>\nI like that.

My ride has been sufficiently pimped. <br/><br/>One thing we have been doing recently is, while there is a GM and everyone owns their character, I try to have the players step up to play NPCs in scenes they aren't in (even "Major" NPCs).  I love this, because it means I lose control of the NPC I have in my head, and someone else gets to add a little to that character, portraying them in their own way. It's had nothing but awesome events, even when that character changed significantly because of it.<br/><br/>But here are the official rules and stuff that we wrote up.<br/><br/>First, here's the new Character Sheet: <a href="http://robo-christ.com/rpg/l5rsheet.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://robo-christ.com/rpg/l5rsheet.pdf</a><br/><br/>I introduced a slightly new way of keeping track of damage. Also, slightly changed how Void points worked. I changed the way Honor works completely so that it doesn't suck, yet retains some of the "John Wick Edge" (it can be used against you).<br/><br/>Next, right as we were getting into it, Travis suggested a free association game: One player would ask the player to his left a question about his or her character, which that player would then reflect on. No answer required then, but just something to think about. The questions were cool: I have them written down at home, the only one I remember off the top of my head was "Why did you steal the secret scroll" (and note: Until this moment no "scroll" existed, nor did the character seem like a thief), and guess what, it was like a 50cc injection of Character Depth into the eyeball. Quinton's Sorcerer got asked that question, and that led Quinton to think about the character in new ways, and basically weaved together this awesome background story on what this scroll was, why he stole it, and in the process came up with a few more motives. Nice!<br/><br/>Finally, I created a totally new element to put motivations and goals front and center on the character sheet. They're like a bastard child of Spiritual Attributes, Fan Mail repositories, TSOY Keys, etc. They're called "The Five Skandhas" ("Go Un"), each one corresponding loosely to one skandha, and one element in the game. (I wanted to give the game a little more Buddhism)<br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skandha" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skandha</a><br/><br/>Basically, throughout the game you get Fanmail. As you get Fan Mail, you dump it into one of five buckets, or Skandhas. Any one you want. Once you hit certain marks, you can then lower the rating of those Skandhas to increase your skills and abilities. <br/>And to keep the game sufficiently John Wick-ish, the player can activate those skandhas to get a handful of bonus dice, but in doing so the GM gets one "fuck you token", which basically the GM can use at any time to say "Nope, You Fail" (or, if better, in an opposed contest each one gives the opponent two extra dice to roll and keep (aside from the rest already rolled). <br/>In play, one player activated three Skandhas on one single (important to the player) roll. That roll then succeeded, barely. Now I, the GM, have 3 evil coins with which I can use to murder them in the face. I think this is in keeping with the rules and feel of Wick's games (like 7th Sea).<br/><br/>Complete rules follow                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136041/#Comment_136041" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-23T12:18:41+00:00" title="March 23, 2008 12:18PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (continued)<br/>-=- THE RULES -=-<br/><br/><b>Entirely New Rules<br/></b><br/><b>SKANDHAS</b>: The "five perceptions" that keep people tied to this world and away from Enlightenment. Each one corresponds to an Element in the game. Here's how they work:<br/>* In each blank (or at least a few blanks) write down one motivation. Or feeling. Or goal. Stuff like "Get revenge upon the master"; "Find out what Raven is up to" "Become the greatest warrior in the land" "I love the minister's daughter". That kind of thing. Could be small goals, or large goals, little motivations or innate desires.<br/>* If you end up setting a low goal and completing it, you can freely change that skandha.<br/>* If you end up setting a goal and then changing your mind to a new goal, that's fine: But you must spend one point out of that skandha to change it, or two points from 1-2 other skandhas.<br/>* Skandhas raise up over the course of the game.<br/>* At the beginning of the game, distribute two points to each skandha, then spread 5 more points to wherever you want.<br/>* Skandhas cap at 10 points. Munchkin.<br/><br/>Skandhas are buckets for Fan Mail!<br/>* Yep, motherfuckin FAN MAIL, bitches.<br/>* When you get your fan mail, dump it in a bucket. Your skandhas are your buckets.<br/>* That's how your Skandhas raise up over time.<br/><br/>Skandhas are Eepz!<br/>*Spend two points from one single skandha (that is, lower its score from X to X-2) to raise any skill by one point.<br/>*Spend eight points from one single skandha to raise an attribute directly related to that skandha by one point.<br/><br/>Skandhas are Bonus Dice!<br/>* Activate a skandha to get that many more bonus die to your die roll. The skandha must relate to the task or conflict at hand. Even squinting and seeing how "it sorta kinda relates if you kinda think about it" is usually ok.<br/>* When you do that, The GM gets a special token, carved out of the souls of the damned.<br/>* The GM can spend this token at any time *on any character* to do the following two actions:<br/>-- *plink* "You Fail".<br/>-- *plink* "Your opponent gains two extra KEEP dice"<br/>* Life is Suffering. Better bone up on the Noble Eightfold Path, bitches.<br/><br/>AIR UN perception<br/>change, intuition, thinking, unseen forces, subtlety, unpredictability<br/><br/>FIRE UN sensation<br/>change, activity, action, force, inspiration, clear thought<br/><br/>EARTH UN form<br/>stability, resistance, fortitude, strength, life, healing, renewal<br/><br/>WATER UN thought, opinion<br/>stability, directed strength, rage, clarity, purity<br/><br/>VOID UN consciousness<br/>anything and everything, the totality of your being<br/><br/>===<b>Rules that Appear to be the Same, but are actually Different</b>===<br/><br/><b>VOID POINTS:</b> Traditionally, each session you can spend one void point and get one free die to add to your total. This is lame.<br/>The new way is that you add one free die, and you get one additional keep in your total. We will playtest this rule: (If it's overpowered, then we'll simply flag this additional die alone as a KEEP die).<br/><br/><b>HONOR</b><br/><br/>Honor is a bonus that you can add to any roll once per session. Honor raises only by the following:<br/>Write me an email with your character's take on some challenges to his or her honor. I'll award or reduce honor from there.<br/>The honor number starts at whatever your honor is on your character sheet, but in a numeric form: "1, plus 5 boxes" is 15. "3, plus 5 boxes" is 35.<br/><br/>The Good: You get to do something incredible. However, it has to be related to the old-school dusty-book expired concept of "Teh Samurai" (or "Teh Yakuza"): All honor; willing to throw anything away to serve the master and clan, Rah Rah Charge into Battle with a Rusty Katana, etc. It only can be added in situations where it would apply. A fight: Yes. Impress a lady: Maybe (if you're not trying to seduce her, simply to appear great to her, etc). Guess the bet right on a game of Han-Cho: Nope.<br/><br/>The Bad: Honor cuts both ways. You can attempt to turn someone's honor against them. Here's the rules:<br/>- You'll have to set up a situation where the opponent stands to lose face.<br/>- The best way to threaten their honor is not to say (in character) "Wouldn't it be dishonorable, Lord, to send your army outnumbered into a fight?" (in order to score some more gear/funds/etc). But rather set up a situation out of character, like: "I stammer a bit at his order, making it look like I'm conflicted as to my duty. I look him in the eye. Basically, I'm setting it up so that he rethinks the situation in terms of his honor". In short, set someone up. Don't just point and say "Hey, isn't that dishonorable?"<br/>- Do it convincingly, and their honor gets applied against them (to your roll). If there is a question or doubt, or it seems dramatic, we might have a "convince them socially" roll-off to see if their honor applies against them. <br/><b><br/>DAMAGE</b><br/><br/>The damage scale has been changed. See the character sheet.  In L5R, when you are "Down", you have to spend a Void point to do anything, and then you're still at -4 or whatever dice.  In this version, if you are "Down" you still need to spend a Void point to act, but you will get a +5 Dice Bonus to that action. Wowz! Be careful, though, because you're almost dead.<br/> <br/>When the dead level is touched, the monster that hit you will hit you again in the next round (and thus kill you for good). If you happen to take enough damage to finish you off, you actually fill up everything up to the very last box in the Dead column. And if you get hit again, you're dead for good. If you do not get healing very quickly, you will die at this point (make an absurd Earth ring roll to stay alive: It's not just Stamina, it's the lower of your Stamina or Willpower).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136457/#Comment_136457" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-26T07:45:12+00:00" title="March 26, 2008  7:45AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool stuff, Andy.<br/><br/>Is this the same group you were doing Falling Blossoms with?<br/><br/>- Don                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136523/#Comment_136523" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-26T12:04:15+00:00" title="March 26, 2008 12:04PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: eruditus</cite>Is this the same group you were doing Falling Blossoms with?</blockquote>\nHeya, this is my bi-weekly game group.

The other thing I'm thinking of is hacking up the setting a bit. If nothing else, making it an island nation or at least a peninsula or something. I was watching a bit of the drama Atsuhime, about a princess from Kagoshima/Kyuushu, and the port of Dejima (where the Hollanders were allowed to trade from time to time) was a central part of some stories.

I often wonder how much of Japan's culture and philosophy is owed to the fact that it is an island nation, but I'm no sociologist. That said, the cultural mishmash of Rokugan makes my teeth hurt more often than not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
