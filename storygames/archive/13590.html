There is so much to know and the vast majority of us do not know much of it. PDFs and POD make the means of production more accessible to us than in the past but now there are iphone apps - and how the hell do you make those?!? The means of production is alienated from me again!<br/><br/>The complex system of game making boils down into four parts.<br/><br/>The means of creativity - Writing and having something to write about. <br/><br/>The means of production - Being able to make something economically that is precieved as valuable.<br/><br/>The means of distribution - Basically this means sales. You can put your game out for free as a PDF but if it isn't dstributed and seen it really hasn't been distributed.<br/><br/>The means of coordination - In a word management and accounting.<br/><br/><br/><br/>So I've been doing the creative part for 25 years. I know how to write and have something to write about. I've learned how to make games in a variety of ways in the last ten years (but not the new and cool apps!) My distribution sucks because that is really a full time job and I've already got a day job. I need an organization to get this done - on a shoe string budget. Fortunately I understand accounting and basic management so I think I can do that part - when I have an organization.<br/><br/>Sooooo<br/><br/>I think we all like to write - see all the messages we type.<br/><br/>PDF and POD make production easy for everyone - though I've personally moved on from that.<br/><br/>Sales! We all hate selling things. I like working a booth at Gen Con but feel completely out of my element in making sales calls. It's an emotional thing.<br/><br/>And it took me years, many years, to get comfortable with accounting and management.<br/><br/>So how alienating is this process - game making? How can we help the people who come after us move through learning it more easily (less painfully)? Are there parts of the process that I'm missing? I know it sounds real Marxist and materialistic but it seems like a good way of getting my mind around this whole system.<br/><br/>Anyway - these are just some random musings that could go off in any number of directions. I give it to you to see where you take it.<br/><br/>Chris Engle                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307150">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307150/#Comment_307150" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-06T14:27:13+00:00" title="January  6, 2011  2:27PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Traditionally that's where the publishing system comes in.  Freelancer does the creativity part, publisher handles all the rest (or contracts out to wholesaler's etc).  Traditionally this is done under a model where the publisher is the center of the business and hires the Freelancer.<br/><br/>What I'm excited about seeing coming out now is the opposite arrangement.  Where the creative person is the center and hires the publisher as a subcontractor to handle the other three...or a combination of other entities to handle different parts.<br/><br/>This model is way more consistant with the idea of being independent, because you're hiring a publisher to work for you rather than you working for them.<br/><br/>I think embracing, encouraging, using, and promoting the new companies coming out now who are fulfilling those roles is a great way of making it more painless for others.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307164">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307164/#Comment_307164" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-06T16:05:09+00:00" title="January  6, 2011  4:05PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Technology is making changes in this faster than I can keep up, I tend to keep my mouth shut about it except to occasionally say "Wow", but yeah.

In part, I am drawn to development and publishing because if offers so much to learn and to grow.   I would argue that Sales/Distribution and Marketing/Communication are different beasts entirely and that you might have 5 categories in total.  I enjoy the richness of subject matter and the learning opportunities.  Not to mention that there is an aspect of creativity in the presentation of a game, in the method of sales, in the method of distribution and in the nature of your communications with the outside world.   <br/><br/>Then again, I am coming from the very shallow end of the experience-pool.

I personally find the sales part more daunting than the marketing part. We all like writing on line and talking up our ideas (marketing) but making sales calls to stores or distributors - that is daunting.<br/><br/>Tyler - I'm certain I could learn how to make an app - I'm constantly learning - but it doesn't build of what I spent the last six years learning (how to make board games). If I did learn it I would just be getting it down when the tech moved on. So for myself I'm going to stick with what I know or try to get some young kid to do the programming. It has to be real cheap though because I got no money for this.<br/><br/>Ralph's idea that game designers are hiring publishers is the Forge - use POD or PDF sales - model. It certainly works on one level. Ralph and a few other early Forge publishers have done well with it. If I just made books I think I wold go that way myself but since I don't I kind of out in the cold. There really are no good POD boardgame makers out there. I've looked and where they fall down is with their boxes. There are a lot of timing and luck factors in making the model work as well. If I had been on the Forge in 2001 maybe Matrix Games would have been bigger? As it was I got there in 2005 and while I feel like I'm part of the club and known I know I'm no star. If I have any success it will come from the slow hard slog. <br/><br/>We are at an interesting time. The sale of tangible products and artifacts (like game books or board games) is still here but it is challenged by electronic games more than even computer games challenged games in the 1980's. Computer games sold better than pen and paper games but they increased the sale of game books (or at least that's what I heard back then). Now they seem to be more in competition. We tangible product guys are smaller than Apple and always will be and our place in the market is unclear to me. I see my friends who are game store owners facing the same dilema. Things are changing fast and the only thing I can say for certain is that the new cool tech today will be old and forgotten two years from now. <br/><br/>Yet still I slog on...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307228/#Comment_307228" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-07T06:23:35+00:00" title="January  7, 2011  6:23AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Making apps is easy like making games is easy, and cheap like buying a car is cheap.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307245">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307245/#Comment_307245" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-07T07:29:37+00:00" title="January  7, 2011  7:29AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            you can actually hire people in India and china to make iphone apps. the SDK for the iphone is $100, but most of my knowledge is second hand. apparently all you need to learn is access to Google                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307256">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Sheridan" title="Matt Sheridan"><img alt="Matt Sheridan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img358.imageshack.us/img358/1651/gear9ok.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Sheridan">Matt Sheridan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307256/#Comment_307256" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-07T07:57:07+00:00" title="January  7, 2011  7:57AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, how are people feeling about print on demand, these days?<br/><br/>My exposure to the subject is all second hand and mostly from the indie comics community, but I'd heard the profit margins with POD were razor thin, and the physical quality of the books was underwhelming.

These are significant advantages for some people! The margins are, indeed, pretty thin.<br/><br/>Short-run digital printing (of 100-250 books at a time) is where I do the majority of my print runs. It takes more time on the phone with printers, and you have to manage inventory and shipping, but the margins are much better. In addition, short-run printers will work with you to do things that aren't possible with true PoD (which, so far as I've experienced, have set book templates that you pick and choose from, so if you have an odd trim size or something you can't use them). Annalise, for example, uses two kinds of paper stock and page-specific color, neither of which I could do with Lulu. carry, which I could print PoD, is over 3$ cheaper per book to print in quantities of 100+ than it would be to do PoD.<br/><br/>My understanding is that its possible to get offset print runs in quantity of 1000 or 1500 these days, which is an even better margin (generally), but the up-front capital investment is still pretty high compared to the digital printing of 100, and you have to be confident that you'll sell through 1/3 to 1/2 of the run to pay for it.

I spent the last 5 years studying programming, but I don't expect any of it to be transferable to publishing. They're different things and require different skills. How are you being more alienated by the existence of iPhone apps than the existence of theatrical movie releases? You don't know how to do that either, right?<br/><br/>Are you suggesting that iPhone apps are about to become some sort of inseperable part of games in such a way that game designers will NEED to know it, or do you just wish you had a really cool app to go with your game?

When I use the word alienated I'm not meaning it in the angry teenage meaning where I'm upset by not knowing this new skill. I'm meaning it in the old economic meaning of being separated from something - in this case a means of production.<br/><br/>I recognize that programing and publishing are very different skill sets. There is a lot of computer knowledge needed to do the production part of game making which I've learned but there is also a lot of other skills as well (knowledge of materials, lay out, writing, proof reading etc.) One can not quickly jump from one discipline to another.<br/><br/>As a programmer you probably don't know what I know about publishing (alienation by lack of knowledge) and you probably don't have the machines I have (alienation from capital equipment). I'm not able to program (alienation by lack of knowledge). But with POD game makers have been able to get into publishing easily without spending the time to learn how it is done on a nuts and bolts level. Technology closed the alienation from means of production in printing.<br/><br/>I don't know if iphone apps are going to be the next thing that endures but they are certainly hot now. If they do come one and become the way people like getting their information products (because in the end what else is a game) then I missed the bus. I'm not crying about this - just recognizing it. It is an artifact of age, we are bound by our life experiences.<br/><br/>With this threat I'm also looking at other areas we are frequently alienated from by lack of knowledge (or in the case of sales calls that feeling of fear that many have). Thoughts and ideas on this are welcome but as I said above it is sort of a brain fart idea. <br/><br/>Cheers!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307454/#Comment_307454" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-08T13:25:58+00:00" title="January  8, 2011  1:25PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Apps today are still largely a garage business, but there are an increasing number of corporate start-ups muscling in.

I have written print orders and software specs.  I have managed software outsourcing projects.<br/><br/>A print order, nowadays, is a matter of a few paragraphs.  Or mouse clicks.  POD-guy takes this print order and your mechs, prints your order, and ships it.  You verify the print run is good.  You're done.  Maybe there's a couple of cycles of proofing in there too.<br/><br/>App-guy, on the other hand, needs a spec that will describe, with as few ambiguities and contradictions as possible, how your software will operate.  This is a very complicated thing to write.  I have written specs that are dozens of pages long.  I have implemented specs of over a hundred pages. Every incompleteness or ambiguity in that spec will cost you, the client, $$.<br/><br/>Plus, App-guy's work is never done.  They will be with you for the entire lifetime of App, because software is a living thing.  "Completed" software still requires testing, updating, enhancing, porting, and bugfixing.  App-guy gets paid for all of those activities.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307474">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307474/#Comment_307474" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-08T18:26:45+00:00" title="January  8, 2011  6:26PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now, having shit on the thread, here's a constructive post.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MatrixGamer</cite>How can we help the people who come after us move through learning it more easily (less painfully)?</blockquote>\nMake games that are hackable, or frameworks that are exploitable.
