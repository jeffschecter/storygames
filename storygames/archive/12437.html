Burroughs<br/>\n<br/>\n"Cut word lines \u2014 Cut music lines \u2014 Smash the control images \u2014 Smash the control machine \u2014 Burn the books \u2014 Kill the priests \u2014 Kill! Kill! Kill!" -- William S. Burroughs, from <i>The Soft Machine</i><br/>\n<br/>\nWhen faced with seemingly random details, humans find a way to join these into a meaningful whole through story. At the most basic level, we take our disparate memories and construct from them our own life stories. When we dream, we experience unrelated images, sensations, thoughts and feelings. It's only upon waking that the brain constructs a coherent dream narrative.<br/>\n<br/>\n(What about lucid dreaming? Just a construct, like free will. Research shows the muscle impulses of arm movement preceding the decision to move the arm. Thus, the decision is the result of action, not the other away around. In the same way, the brain ascribes intentionality to lucid dreams while it is constructing the narrative of the dream memory.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat this means for games is -- when we remove the story from a game, our brains will nevertheless construct a story. By abandoning familiar, time-tested story structure, we move away from satisfaction and entertainment into the unsettling realm of dream and vision. We meet the inhabitants of our unconscious minds, who themselves are playing the game in order to know us better. Games that take us away from drama, from traditional patterns of tension and release, from beginning and ending, from the unidirectional arrow of time, will take us into a new and bewildering landscape. We may find boredom there, confusion and incomprehension, but if we're fortunate, we will reach the greater rewards of awe, epiphany and primal terror.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery RPG manifesto should include an example game, but this one does not. You will find the example game within your own infinite mind.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279349">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher" title="Christopher"><img alt="Christopher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher">Christopher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279349/#Comment_279349" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-05T15:13:15+00:00" title="July  5, 2010  3:13PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All while drinking Mountain Dew!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_279351">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snej" title="snej"><img alt="snej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mooseyard.com/JensStuff/Self-portrait%20with%20hat%2032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snej">snej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279351/#Comment_279351" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-05T15:32:21+00:00" title="July  5, 2010  3:32PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm...

The first player begins by saying "Yup," then following this up with a sentence that contains no actual information in it whatsoever. The second player then has to say "Yup," and contributes his own sentence that also contains no meaningful information, and that cannot in any sensible way be understood as having been prompted by the first.<br/><br/>The game continues until one of the players either pauses for too long or breaks one of the rules.<br/><br/>Example of play:<br/><br/>P1: "Yup, it might just rain today."<br/>P2: "Yup, there some mighty big stuff out there in outer space."<br/>P1: "Yup, them wheat stalks sure is stalky."<br/>P2: "Yup, sometimes a feller's Banjo will go right out of tune."<br/>P1: "Yup, some peoples can play them musical instruments, but some can't."<br/><br/>Game Over! Player One just veered way too close to Player Two's subject matter.<br/><br/>I'm less than confident that William Burroughs would have been scintillated by this example.

I was hoping that a followup would come more easily, but my thoughts have not advanced much since then.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, playing RPGs is not easy. I have ADD (of the primarily inattentive ilk) and a tendency toward anxiety. So, it can be difficult for me to follow along unless I'm really, really engaged. And it can be hard for me to speak when it's time for me to say what my character is doing -- it's suddenly mental blank time. And I'm uncomfortable with decisions and consequences. And, although I can be both intelligent and creative, this comes out more in reflection or in writing than it does when I'm on put on the spot. So, for me, being a player is largely stressful.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a player, I'm not good at long range planning. I react to the moment, when I can. In real life, I tend to work on larger projects intuitively and non-linearly, which doesn't seem to work well in games when my guy needs to be cooperating with other characters.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlus, I'm terrible at story. When I read a novel or see a movie, I get vividly immersed but then after, I'm left with impressions and memories of intense moments rather than any kind of plot outline. And I am really wary about predictable outcomes and happy endings.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I never give RPGs up completely. There are intermittent and random moments of positive reinforcement that reward and torment. In gaming, I have experienced intense laughter, amazement and moments where everything comes together in a beautiful and astonishing way. So, I'm the mouse that keeps pressing the lever, waiting for a food pellet to drop.<br/>\n<br/>\nFortunately, there are so many different kinds of RPGs that support so many different ways of playing and suit so many different temperaments. There are games that tend to the surreal and dreamlike, which suit me more than games of missions and rapid action. There are GMless games, which appeal strongly to me. And there are so many people in the world. Whatever the heck tribe I belong to, I just need to keep my eyes open for other members -- other weirdos like me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279924">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279924/#Comment_279924" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-09T18:13:33+00:00" title="July  9, 2010  6:13PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you for sharing so honestly, James!<br><br>I'm curious what you mean by this part:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Yasha</cite>And I am really wary about predictable outcomes and happy endings.</blockquote>\nCan you explain a little more?<br><br>Also, what would your dream/ideal RPG be like?                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_279932">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279932/#Comment_279932" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-09T20:40:00+00:00" title="July  9, 2010  8:40PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wrote a game that didn't let you tell stories.

I react to the moment, when I can.

And I am really wary about predictable outcomes and happy endings.</blockquote>\nI just wanted to say that when I play for RPGs I play for story. And when I play, as a GM or as a Player, I'm never concerned with "long range planning."  I react in the moment, having my characters (whether as Player or GM) react in the moment in turn. <br><br>In the games I enjoy playing (<i>Sorcerer, HeroQuest</i> in Glorantha, <i>Dogs in the Vineyard, In A Wicked Age..., Polaris, 3:16</i>, and others) there is no expectation that anyone's Player Character will be cooperating with the other character. Sometimes they do, sometimes they don't, and sometimes they're at each other's throats. And that's a feature, not a bug. Every decision is alive and intriguing and without any constraint about what is "supposed" to happen.<br><br>Now, I'm blessed with amazing players I love playing with -- for whom conflict between characters is just part of the Tools of Awesome we can pick up and use. But the fact remains that in all the games I listed above the games expect -- if not in some cases encourage -- conflicts between the Player Characters. It's not an exceptional thing. It's part of the nature of the beast.<br><br>As for predictable outcomes and happy endings -- I think you're conflating "story" with "a certain kind of ending." <br><br>Again, when I play any of the games I mentioned above I have no idea where the story is going, whether I'm a Player or the GM. And I mean... No Idea Where The Story Is Going At All. We're making it up as we go along. And certainly no one is angling for a certain kind of ending (happy or otherwise). Sometimes some character's stories end well and sometimes the guy ends up dead in the gutter for all his troubles and actions. <br><br/>And some of my favorite writers, by the way, work the same way. They start with a situation -- and then they just go, letting their character react in the moment, piling up the decisions and the consequences of their actions, and then having them have to react again and so on, until a resolution of some sort is reached and the story ends. <br/><br/>I understand that you might want to be blowing up everything about story -- that just might be the case. <br/><br/>But I want to point out that some of the things you think make "story happen" might not actually have to happen. There are plenty of games that "make story" (at least in my experience) that don't involve the kinds of behaviors and limitations you seem to assume are required for story.<br/><br/>CK                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_280080">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson" title="Matt Wilson"><img alt="Matt Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dog-eared-designs.com/img/goaticon2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson">Matt Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280080/#Comment_280080" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-12T06:45:50+00:00" title="July 12, 2010  6:45AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            James:<br/><br/>I'm very sad that I never get to play with you any more.

People get together to play some game and nothing really happens, but afterwards their memories end up creatively edited and they're like, "Yeah, like that time when X!" "Yeah, that was awesome!" when, at the time, it wasn't perceived as awesome at all. I did this too, with some of my early games (which shall never, ever, ever see the light of day again).<br/><br/>I dunno.

I think I was talking about moments in games that were the result of blatantly manipulative, but well-intentioned, narration by GMs, who were trying to close the circle of a hero's journey, or some such. I want a game to feel living, organic and alive rather that formulaic and dead.<br/><br/>To describe what my ideal RPG would be like, I'm going to use a musical example. Pauline Oliveros, a composer who plays an equal tempered accordion and was an early electronic music pioneer, wrote a series of exercises that she calls "Sonic Meditations". One such exercise involves a number of people lying on the floor, heads together and bodies radiating out. Everyone follows a recipe that involves breathing, listening, making sounds -- I can't remember the exact formula. The result is, there is the sense of being part of a eerie, angelic music that goes through various evolutions before reaching a climax and then reaching an end, without anyone directing what is happening.<br/><br/>In fact I think there are games that are close to this, where a story emerges from a group of players which ebbs and flows and organically comes to a close. From my one experience of IAWA, it seems like such a game. Polaris may be, too, and there are probably many others.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_280467">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Yasha" title="Yasha"><img alt="Yasha" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/535/nC2R7IBQNACRI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Yasha">Yasha</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280467/#Comment_280467" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-13T15:59:29+00:00" title="July 13, 2010  3:59PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TylerT</cite><a href="/forums/profile/yasha%27s">@yasha's</a> OP<br/><br/>i just wanted to lend a little support,<br/><br/>i have written some grandiose manifestos like your's, and their ideas have fueled some of my very best work. but i'm very glad i have not shown most or any of these to people. while you must start working with a big idea, people take you far more seriously after you have managed to realize it as a functioning thing. it's also much easier for others to understand the big idea if they can see it as a working example.<br/><br/>so take your big ideas and<em>WORK</em>i want to see where you're headed.</blockquote>\nThanks, Tyler --<br/><br/>I don't regret laying out my manifesto here because it was meant to entertain and provoke and cry out for help and speak in parables. When I'm isolated from others, I tend to go in circles and make little progress, so I have to speak out with my crazy talk now and then. That's the only way I know what I'm actually thinking, sometimes. Someday, I'll learn to converse.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_280472">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Yasha" title="Yasha"><img alt="Yasha" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/535/nC2R7IBQNACRI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Yasha">Yasha</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280472/#Comment_280472" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-13T16:12:22+00:00" title="July 13, 2010  4:12PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite><br/>In the games I enjoy playing (<i>Sorcerer, HeroQuest</i>in Glorantha,<i>Dogs in the Vineyard, In A Wicked Age..., Polaris, 3:16</i>, and others) there is no expectation that anyone's Player Character will be cooperating with the other character. Sometimes they do, sometimes they don't, and sometimes they're at each other's throats. And that's a feature, not a bug. Every decision is alive and intriguing and without any constraint about what is "supposed" to happen.<br/></blockquote>\nThanks, Christopher, I think I needed this reminder. I've played in games like that, and it can be great, as long as I know what I want to be doing or what the character wants to be doing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_280508">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280508/#Comment_280508" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-13T18:48:05+00:00" title="July 13, 2010  6:48PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Yasha</cite>To describe what my ideal RPG would be like, I'm going to use a musical example. Pauline Oliveros, a composer who plays an equal tempered accordion and was an early electronic music pioneer, wrote a series of exercises that she calls "Sonic Meditations". One such exercise involves a number of people lying on the floor, heads together and bodies radiating out. Everyone follows a recipe that involves breathing, listening, making sounds -- I can't remember the exact formula. The result is, there is the sense of being part of a eerie, angelic music that goes through various evolutions before reaching a climax and then reaching an end, without anyone directing what is happening.</blockquote>\nIf there is anything less like "without anyone directing what is happening" than the Oliveros Sonic Meditations, I can't think of it off the top of my head. It is <i>highly, extremely</i> directed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_280530">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280530/#Comment_280530" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-13T21:28:15+00:00" title="July 13, 2010  9:28PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://squid314.livejournal.com/275614.html" rel="nofollow">WW2: full of plot holes.</a><br/><br/>A propos of this discussion because it points out that reality is often stranger and makes less sense than fiction.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
