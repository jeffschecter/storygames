Four of the players are playing dream thieves, and I am playing The Mark, the person they want to steal information from by invading my dream. The game is designed to divide the responsibility of the traditional GM among the players.<br/><br/>These are the roles in the game, and we had exactly five players, so it worked out well:<br/><br/>- The Mark is the person the dream thieves are trying to steal from. Their job is to facilitate the game, asking questions and helping people do cool things with their role. If the game is stalling, they can give the thieves ideas of what to do, or if the game is moving too fast they can introduce potential obstacles to slow it down. Whenever a dream thief fails a roll, the Mark gets to roll to see if they realize that they are having their dreams infiltrated. If they move through the four stages of realization, the dream thieves lose. The Mark doesn\u2019t have any veto power or \u201cauthority\u201d any more than any of the other players.<br/><br/>- The Infiltrator (Leonardo DiCaprio) is the thief in charge of finding potential hiding places for the secret within the dream and \u201cmental safe-cracking,\u201d problem-solving how one might access the secrets inside those hiding places. The Infiltrator rolls dice to discover and hack these hiding places.<br/><br/>- The Lookout (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is the thief in charge of security. A timer is set for 8 minutes of real-time. Every time the timer goes off, the subconscious security forces of the Mark attack one or more of the dream thieves. The Lookout rolls dice to determine if the security forces are defeated successfully. If the Lookout fails a roll, the security forces divert the dream thieves away from their current path, and the thieves are forced to find a different route or take a different approach.<br/><br/>- The Architect (Ellen Paige) is the thief in charge of creating the dream world. At the beginning of the game, the Architect roughly describes the major set pieces of the dream. During the game, any questions about the physical environment are directed toward the Architect. The Architect can roll dice to insert deus ex machina like solutions into the dream (think of the paradoxes in Inception.) If the Architect fails the roll, other players\u2019 emotional baggage starts to enter the dream and hinder their progress.<br/><br/>- The Forger (Tom Hardy) is the thief in charge of impersonating people close to the Mark within the dream. They interrogate the subconscious projections of important people and use that to trick the Mark into doing certain things or divulging information that might help other thieves. The Forger rolls dice to extract information from the Mark. When they succeed, they get to give another thief a bonus to one of their rolls.<br/><br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/><br/>The session had a lot of good things going on. The world the Architect built was detailed and interesting and the way the dream thieves finally steal the information feels very <i>Inception</i>-y in a way that no one really planned. It just kind of all came together at the end.<br/><br/><b>The full synopsis of the session can be read <a href="https://goo.gl/EIiW9C" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</b><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
