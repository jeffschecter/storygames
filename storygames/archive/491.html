<div class="Message">
<p>So, over in <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=382&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">Making the first session rock hard</a> I wrote up a series of questions for making a rockin' bang:</p>
<ul>
<li>What was your character trying to achieve before the story started? </li>
<li>Why do they, as a person, uniquely need to achieve this? </li>
<li>How did it go wrong?</li>
</ul>
<p>I am planning to have a more specific version of these questions in Misery Bubblegum, and I want peoples opinions.  The questions go like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) What was your character trying to achieve before the story started? </li>
<li>(2) Why do they, as a person, uniquely need to achieve this? </li>
<li>(3) Who prevents you from achieving this?</li>
<li>(4) What trait(s) of that person act against your goal every time they appear?</li>
</ul>
<p>So, the ridiculous version:</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) Eat the Road Runner</li>
<li>(2) I'm a very hungry coyote</li>
<li>(3) The Road Runner</li>
<li>(4) Very fast, incredibly lucky</li>
</ul>
<p>For the less ridiculous version:</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) Be an uncaring nihilist</li>
<li>(2) I've been hurt, and I refuse to be hurt again</li>
<li>(3) Veronica</li>
<li>(4) Sweet, sincere, cares about me</li>
</ul>
<p>Then you get into the question of "Who is <strong>really</strong> stopping you?" ... do you give the "truth" or do you say what the character believes?  I'm inclined toward the latter.  This sequence ...</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) Have Gerald fall madly in love with me</li>
<li>(2) He's the social king of the school, I'm the social queen, I need this for my status</li>
<li>(3) That mousy little girl, Jessica who keeps getting Gerald's attention</li>
<li>(4) Sincere, friendly, innocent</li>
</ul>
<p>... Seems much better to me than this one ...</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) Have Gerald fall madly in love with me</li>
<li>(2) He's the social king of the school, I'm the social queen, I need this for my status</li>
<li>(3) Gerald</li>
<li>(4) Cold, distant, views me like a little sister</li>
</ul>
<p>... though both work.  It's just that the second one is much closer to engaging with the real issues, rather than frantically trying to shame and attack Jessica as a sort of proxy-war for Gerald's attentions.</p>
<p>Right.  Now I'm rambling.  I could use some thoughts.  Thanks in advance!</p>

                            Aren't the answers to these questions flags the players are throwing up?  Couldn't either version lead to confronting the real issues?  Whether the attention is on Gerald or Jessica changes the focus but not the issue.  Resolving the dispute through Jessica still resoves the dispute - it just makes Gerald furniture, right?                        </div>

                            (Because I am very dense, this is the first time I've realized that Misery Bubblegum could be used to generate Veronica Mars-like scenarios.  Tony, you just guaranteed one sale.)<br/>
<br/>
I think Ben's on the right path with the inclusion of both Jessica and Gerald.  In real life, there would be two perspectives on the Gerald situation:  one that the social queen sees, and one that everybody else sees (but to which our social queen is blind).  I haven't been keeping up with your MB posts on the Forge for a couple months, but is there a way to keep one set of answers ("what I believe") and distribute the other (the "real" reasons) to everybody else?                        </div>

                            I know it's basic, but couldn't you just say that the person in (3) cannot be the same person as (1)? The opposition must come from a third party, in other words. I know that blocks the Roadrunner example, but that's a fairly simplistic story there, isn't it?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe reward players more if (3) isn't the same as (1), rather than an outright ban?                        </div>

<p>See, I'm not convinced that I <em>want</em> players thinking about "the truth."</p>
<p>Like, if JD wants to be a nihilist, and Veronica somehow moves him to emotion, and that's a big problem for him ... I'm pretty sure I don't want the players thinking too far beyond that.  Because, really, the story of "I'm going to use Veronica as a prop to explore my own purely internal issues" is ... it's not as good a story as "Veronica <strong>makes</strong> me feel these bad things, so I'm going to do my level best to corrupt her into my own death-embracing life-path, because ... because ... I <em>have to</em>!"</p>
<p>Also, as with other Misery Bubblegum setup issues, this character creation step is not a once-and-forever thing.  You redo this at the beginning of each session ... maybe the answer this week is the same as last week (Buffy is <em>still</em> the reason why Faith can't just be an irresponsible punk slayerette) or maybe the answer this week is different from the answer last week.</p>
<p>So, yeah, it's sort of flags about "What underlying issue do we want to explore?" but it's also flags about "What <em>particular context</em> will we use to explore it this session?"</p>
<p>But people have a solid point about how multiple people are going to stand in your way in different ways.  Is this something to explore one session at a time (this week the enemy is Jessica, next week the enemy is Gerald) or should there be multiple answers active in the same moment?</p>

                            I like multiple answers active at once--it enforces the idea that solving the problem before you rarely gets you what you want, which is kind of the soul of high school.  I'm sure there are other mechanics in place for that, but still.<br/>
<br/>
What if you-the-player answer questions 3 and 4 once yourself ("it's Jessica!") and two or more other players vote on an answer too ("it's obviously Gerald"), and you-the-player don't get to see what their copy says?                        </div>
