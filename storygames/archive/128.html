<p>Okay, they surely aren't "teh suck"! But they've caused me lots of trouble. Aside from my <a href="http://10by10room.forgreatjustice.net/articles/2006/01/08/aside-why-i-prefer-short-form-rpgs#comments" rel="nofollow">rant on why I prefer short-term games</a>, I'm pissed of at scheduling entropy I'm dealing with right now in my DitV game.</p>
<p>Things were going okay, but then the semesters switched, and everyone has new and mutually locking schedules, such that the only time we have to play weekly is "Tuesday, 7-10pm". I mean, ouch. I'll need to be real hardcore to make that work. And yet I really want to press on because the players just got really invested in their characters (since DitV is a bit of a "develop-in-play" game).</p>
<p>(I guess I'm just testing out the "whine about shit" feature of the forum, and it seems to work. Thanks for listening.)</p>

                            I really want to run a series of 6-10 towns for DitV and then Bridal Falls City and Back East thrown in for good measure.  I think it'd rock.<br/>
<br/>
I've run fairly long term Sorcerer and it was neat to see how Kickers effect a campaign over a long term.  Nifty stuff.<br/>
<br/>
I'm psyched to run a game of TSoY or my modification of it to an Ascension.<br/>
<br/>
And BW has run well over a long term too.<br/>
<br/>
But the thing is, I've got tons of shit I want to run and limited time to do so.  Running a game for years on end just doesn't make sense right now, not because of lack of long term systems I dig but because of lots of cool stuff to run.                        </div>

                            I don't have a beef with multiple session games.  What annoys me, though, are multiple session games that try and ignore the fact that they're played out over multiple sessions.  Any other serial story -- whether in television, magazine, trilogy, whatever -- is patently aware of its medium and uses the characteristics of that medium to its advantage.  Each episode/segment/novel has its own begining, rising action, and end, and most have their own little mini-themes that contribute to the whole season/series/trilogy.<br/>
<br/>
However, this sort of consciousness of medium is almost completely absent from multi-session roleplaying games, which tend to expect the players to just run from beginning to end of one very large story and not notice that they do it in hours-long chunks separated by days and weeks of downtime.  This is why I am eager to get into a game of Primetime Adventures, as it reconfigures the traditional "campaign" into a "season" with explicit episodes taking the place of adventures.  I'd find it far more rewarding of a hobby if, every time I stood up from the gaming table, I had enough resolution to feel satisfied and enough foreshadowing to still feel engaged.  This is fertile development ground.                        </div>

                            That's what we've been doing with our Buffy the Vampire Slayer campaign -- i.e. each session is one episode, and one real-world season (Fall to Spring) is one season of the show with 15 episodes.  (We're now coming up on our 40th episode, or the 10th of the third season.)  It works pretty well, I think.  During Season One we had some trouble getting the pacing quite right -- a few episodes were dragged out into two parts.  <br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I didn't have a problem with continuous time.  Analytically, I think the seasonal structure works similarly to the somewhat shorter "adventure" structure of other games.  It resets things so that there isn't an ever-increasing complexity to the game.  For example, in my James Bond 007 campaign each movie plot took 3-4 sessions.  But the Vinland campaign, which I loved, just went continuously for 52 sessions.  The ever-deepening story was part of the appeal.  <br/>
<br/>
One thing I note about session structure is that all games have some sort of start-up phase where you greet, review what happened before, and get started.  However, most larps have a debriefing after a session, while doing so is rare in tabletop.                        </div>

                            Well, it's basically means sitting around and discussing the game out-of-character.  In some cases it's formal -- the organizer gets everyone together and each of the player speaks in turn.  In other cases it's just informal chatting.  I suppose it happens more in larp because (1) people tend to stay in-character much more during a larp; and (2) there are often a bunch of things that happened which a given player never saw.  But it also serves to digest and process what happened during the larp -- people may remark on their feelings or observations about what happened.                        </div>

                            Heya,<br/>
<br/>
I love to play in multi-session games, but I haven't figured out how to design a good game that employs them yet.  If you look at Cutthroat, Hierarchy, and Standoff! they all can be played in one session.  A game of Cutthroat and Standoff! can be played in less than two hours.  My style at the moment just seems to streak towards fast paced sessions with a solid a solid endgame to nicely tie up all the events in a nice neat package.   Maybe (hopefully) someday I'll figure out how to maintain the tension for longer periods.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

                            What do you mean by "multi-session"? Are you talking aobut any game that takes more than 1 session to play, or do you mean more generally long-term games that take months to finish? Here it sounds like anything longer than a single session, but in Dev's rant it sounds like short campaigns ala MLwM are all good.<br/><br/>Most of the games my group plays are in the 3-6 session range (3-4 hours a session). My non-gamer friends look at me funny when I say that my game may take up to 4-5 sessions to finish, but I really like that length. Maybe it's just my group, but it typically takes us about 45 minutes to complete one scene. So in 3-4 hours, we usually get 4-5 scenes. (For example, in the Polaris game we're playing right now, with 5 of us we typically only get one turn a peice per session.)<br/><br/>While it's certainly possible to develop a full story arc in that many scenes, it always feels superficial to me. It's kinda like a 30 minute TV show. Playing 3-6 session feels more like a feature length film.                        </div>

                            Hnh.  One interesting thing about the cadence of episodic play is that D&amp;D ended up being really good for it, bizarrely.<br/>
<br/>
Normally, it's something I have to plan for, but with D&amp;D, the fights are both critically important and are slow (if they're at all complicated, which the interesting ones should be).  The net result is that a given D&amp;D session (for me) tends to be a three act sandwich of either Plot-Fight-Plot or Fight-Plot-Fight.  Having that structure more or less appear organically has, i admit, made longer D&amp;D games easier to juggle than many lighter systems where it's easier to "Get to the point" as it were.<br/>
<br/>
This ended up being very rewarding when I took that knowledge of the cadence and intentionally broke it for an Exalted Campaign,  System complexity wanted to produce the same sandwich, but actively steering away form it ende dup paying out in spades.<br/>

<p><code>What do you mean by "multi-session"?</code></p>
<p>I think I include 3-4 sessions in the "multi-session" category. That's a reasonable number but something of a borderline in terms of scheduling stability. I'm really more bothered by them in terms of practicality rather than as a design choice. (Once we get into the swing of scheduling, then I'm certainly going to enjoy the 8-session arc of Dogs.)</p>

                            Biggest advantage it had was that it took a lot of burden off my shoulders.  _knowing_ that I could do a plot sandwich let me have a default position that was a lot more structured than needing to start from scratch, it let me pick a specific third and really drill down into it.<br/>
<br/>
At first, this produced lopsided sequences of plot-fight-AWESOME PLOT  or Fight - Plot - REALLY COOL NON-FIGHT-CONFLICT or plot-CHARACTER SPOTLIGHT-fight.  Now, I was absolutely helped by the fact that the exalted ruleset is a little more flexible outside of combat than D&amp;D was, but even without that, the ability to really drill down into something did a great job of keeping the episodes structured while creating player buy-in very quickly and very deeply, because the basic structure provided form, and the something extra gave something to take away from the episode as particularly cool.<br/>
<br/>
What's more, it also helped me settle into a system that was pretty new to me, and it helped me develop ownership of the setting, and like learning to juggle, it let me move up to 2 or 3 parts awesome as everyone really hit groove.<br/>
<br/>
Net result was probably my most successful long-run game to date (we went about 60 sessions), and while I've had players want to go back to a setting again in the past, this is the first time I've also had other GMs in the group want to  pick up threads from the game for their own games.  The Exalted game I'm currently playing in is now a spinoff of the game I ran, and that is a  pretty damn cool experience for me.<br/>

                            See, I can't get myself and other people together to play more than once every couple weeks. My gaming time is limited. If I do a long-term game, it means I'm playing that one game to the exclusion of others. That's fine sometimes, but right now I want to try out different games. I want to play one-shots as much as possible to broaden my experiences.                        </div>

                            I've been thinking about this a lot lately, but not reaching any strong conclusions.  I just finished a very long run game, of over 160 sessions, that ended because all the other players pulled the plug on it, without warning me, while I was still having a ball.  So it's an issue I have complex feelings about at the moment.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I've observed is that the people I play with have explicitly stated that they only want to play games that last more than 20 sessions.  When I've suggested playing short run things with them, they are clear that they don't want to play in something that would last 3 sessions, and would regard it as a waste of their time.  Like Levi, they say they don't feel they really know a character until session 9.<br/>
<br/>
However, I've recently discovered that the vast majority of the games they play never make it to that 20 sessions they were telling me was the minimum requirement.  In fact, they often die about session three.  I'm practically the only person with whom they've managed to play a game that's lasted over 50 sessions.<br/>
<br/>
And, hey I'm happy playing very large numbers of sessions provided I'm getting what I want in each (rather than taking a long time to get what I want), and I can manage my schedule to also experiment with other things over a shorter time period.  But there are certainly people who want to play long running games, and consistently fail to do so.  So now I'm wondering why, and what tools would help them?                        </div>

                            Andy, good questions.<br/>
<br/>
The game ended because of two main things.  Way back at the other players said they wanted X* instead of Y**, but really wanted X and Y and just assumed that everyone wanted Y so the desire for at least some Y didn't need to be said.  I was all X.  We happily played X for a while, until they started getting unhappy that Y wasn't happening and that I wasn't particularly interested in Y.  They finally realise that they neither understood nor could articulate what they wanted when the game started years ago, I did exactly what they said they wanted and now they realise they don't really want that after all.  Because of how the game has changed over all those sessions, it's no longer a good vehicle for either what they originally wanted to do, or what they want to do now.<br/>
<br/>
They're more interested in the new sort of fun they want now (fighting pirates! rah!) than continuing the existing fun of the game.  So the idea is to kill that game, and start a new one.  Which would be fine and dandy, if I wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t still having lots of fun and had recently been working hard to make it fun for them too.  The other players basically decided they weren't willing to put in the same effort.<br/>
<br/>
And they told me in a rather gutting fashion, the day before we were due to play that game, after we'd previously all agreed that we would be putting in that effort, and I was already getting annoyed because I seemed to be the only one actually following through on that effort towards goals they had defined.  Which pissed me off, but I'm trying not to let that anger colour my longer term view.<br/>
<br/>
As for why their other games seem to end before they reach the playersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ stated ideal of 20 sessions, they seem to get distracted by new ideas.  They start a game, play for a bit, and then get a new idea for a game and start that game without formally ending the old one.  Because they also donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t feel emotionally engaged with the PCs until 6+ sessions.  So if something that seems more fun comes along before that point, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s easy to ditch the game because they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t care about it all that much.<br/>
<br/>
My basic conclusion is that they get initially excited about a game and enjoy the creation rich beginning and the potential it holds for long term play.  They enjoy a long running game when it's been going long enough.  But they remain distractible by new and shinier ideas.  I don't think they know how to reliably turn the start of a game into a long running, enjoyable play experience, so part of the excitement of a new game is that it comes with the potential for long term play.  They can then enjoy thinking about that potential, which is about as close to the long term play they think they want as they usually get.<br/>
<br/>
Which bugs me because I start caring about the game from the first session, or I stop playing, and then get a game dropped by people who havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t made the same investment.  Now IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m rambling and grumping rather than constructively commenting.<br/>
