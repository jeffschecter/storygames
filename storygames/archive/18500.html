Of course, the Horus Dimension itself is also generally believed to not exist, but never mind that for now. Anyway, the fruit of the borganza tree, which are supposed to look like bananas, except that they're smaller and more green than yellow, are indeed edible, and do taste like bananas, but have a bizarre effect, whereby for a couple of minutes after eating the eater feels extremely lightheaded and seems to leave their body, following which they feel as though they're travelling through all the dimensions at once. This feeling has been worked out as lasting roughly six minutes, and afterwards the person is left feeling absolutely drained, as if they've somehow had their soul ripped from their body and clumsily re-inserted. <br/><br/>Yeah, crazy huh? I think those folks who claim to have been to the Horus Dimension in the first place, let alone eaten the fruit of this so-called borganza tree, are either loopy or have been dropping some seriously bad acid.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416470">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TotallyGuy" title="TotallyGuy"><img alt="TotallyGuy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TotallyGuy">TotallyGuy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416470/#Comment_416470" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-17T07:16:43+00:00" title="June 17, 2013  7:16AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's a lady finger banana.
