It wasn't me! is from the Norwegian style -anthology of norwegian role-playing games.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have some sketchy notes from which I'll try to reconstruct as much of the game as I can.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game starts by the shocking news of Lady Gaga's murder! She had just had a gig and had left for an after-party at the freemasons' (gasp!) yacht. The freemasons had invited Lady Gaga there, because they wanted to polish their "dubious and secretive cult" -imago and appear more as a hip and in crowd. It's a dark night and drugs have been used excessively at the party in the yacht. <br/>\n<br/>\n*LIE!*  (It wasn't me! has a system, where a player can decide that something that other player narrated, is a lie. He gets to decide what happens instead. The player whose narration was vetoed, also seems more dubious and has a higher chance to get picked as the murderer in the end)<br/>\n<br/>\nActually the freemasons didn't use any drugs at all. They are not that kind of crew. But Lady Gaga died of an overdose! By a chemical substance from Russia. Actually, the chemical substance was a steroid normally used on horses. Heavy stuff. There are no signs on how the substance was given or ended up in Lady Gaga's system.<br/>\n<br/>\n*LIE*<br/>\n<br/>\nA small needlemark can be found on Lady Gaga's thigh. That must be the way the poison was administered.<br/>\n<br/>\nAccusations were thrown and people got to tell why they couldn't be the one who did it. I personally was below deck, so I couldn't have made it. One player was working as a referee at the football-games in South Africa, so he obviously couldn't do it either. One was a bleeding long-haired hippie, so he wouldn't have any business getting into a freemason party anyways.<br/>\n<br/>\nActually it turned out, that the hippie had swam on board and was at the party. Still, no motive yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext round, we set out to find the motive. Money and power were the obvious reasons. Lady Gaga had written a new will, that somehow had caused someone to kill her. Also, envy and political reasons were mentioned. Lady Gaga represented everything a puritanical person couldn't stand, like bending gender roles and such. I have even sketchier notes from the last parts of the game, so Im not so sure what happened at this point anymore. No consensus was formed on who really had done it. Couple suspected the anarchist, because he had the connections to Russia and he detested Lady Gaga. The hippie was also mentioned, because he wanted to become on with Lady Gaga and somehow tried to do this by killing her.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the end of It wasn't me! one name is picked out of the hat. Between every round one is voted as being the most likely suspect, and their name is added to the hat. Also, when you tell a lie (someone uses the lie-veto on you), your name is put into the hat. So the one who has tols most lies and gets voted as the most likely suspect most often, has the highest chance of being picked as the killer in the end.<br/>\n<br/>\nI got voted pretty many times in to the hat, and so actually turned out to be the killer of Lady Gaga. I narrated on how it all went down, but sadly, can't actually remember anything about my ending narration at all. Alcohol might have been consumed before, during and after the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, a really funny game. Different than most what passes of as role-playing in Finland. It's a curious difference when you don't actually play out the stories, but just sort of tell them to each other. Different way of approaching this story-creating role-play -thingie. Completely different than those forge-inspired games that I've played, for example. Interesting. Still, I think I like the "my guy stabs him!" -way of doing it more. I associate role-playing so heavily with characters and them doing something, that I maybe feel a bit at loss when it's just players collectively telling a story as narrators.<br/>\n<br/>\nHmm. Yes. I think I really do. An introspective learning experience, now how cool is that!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279967">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279967/#Comment_279967" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-10T06:52:34+00:00" title="July 10, 2010  6:52AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>It Wasn't Me</i> can be safely pitched as a party game.

What you need to remember is that this kind of game is something different than the classical rpg, although it is deceptively similar, so you need to expect something different from it. Remembering that helps me enjoy it more, at least.<br/><br/>Modern design has really widened the scope of role-playing games, partly by diffusing the borders of what they are and may do. We may (and should) debate it, but in the end all we can do is play along, and follow up on the games we really like!<br/><br/>And it makes it more challenging/unpredictable/thrilling to be a gamer!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_280064">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jaakko%20Koivula" title="Jaakko Koivula"><img alt="Jaakko Koivula" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.saunalahti.fi/keizzah/avatar.bmp"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jaakko%20Koivula">Jaakko Koivula</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280064/#Comment_280064" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-12T00:35:22+00:00" title="July 12, 2010 12:35AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah!

Im not yet announcing this as final, but as a working hypothesis for now, I think that characters are my thingie. I actually posted about this same thing at the Forge: http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forge/index.php?topic=29988.msg277677#new<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I realised retrospectively, that out of the three games that I played at the TraCon after-parties, I enjoyed the first one we played with Matthijs the most (http://norwegianstyle.files.wordpress.com/2007/12/five_characters.pdf). That game basically had most characters and least "I narrate how this story progresses" -type of playing, so it suited my preferences best. Also, Im a bit of a larper, so I enjoy properly shouting at other players :&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n(now that I checked the .pdf, the game is actually labeled as a larp, heh :)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
