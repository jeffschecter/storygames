(A lot of indie rpg's, including MH and AW, want a quorum of 4, I think, because you want a triangle of PC relationships and a GM.) Assuming any given one of us can make it 3 out of 4 sessions - which seems pretty good to me, with our busy schedules and who knows when someone's going to get sick or have to work late or go off to a conference or what - that gives us a .75^4 chance of playing on a given night, which is only 31%, which kind of sucks. Particularly if we let ourselves start feeling bad about it - "Hey, why aren't people showing up, do they not like me or my game?" - "Oh, I feel so guilty for having to flake *again*" etc.<br/><br/>So let's say I invite someone else to play and they join on board - now there's 5 - and I just gave myself a refresher course in binomial distributions so I could teach a class, so I can use Excel - <br/>you invite 5 (1 GM+4 players) but you'll still play if only 4 show, using Excel's BINOM.DIST(1,5,0.25,TRUE) that's still only a 63% chance to play. <br/><br/>I don't want to invite 6, because I think games start to suck with 6. But let's look at the math: 6 with a quorum of 4 - BINOM.DIST(2,6,0.25,TRUE), 83% chance of playing, but a (0.75^6)=18% chance of everybody showing up and not having a very good time because of the too-low-participation problem. <br/><br/>Still, I'm kind of liking those odds, I think I'd be happy with 1 out of 5 nights being kind of crappy so that I could play on 4 out of 5.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_360006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360006/#Comment_360006" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-16T11:35:27+00:00" title="February 16, 2012 11:35AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            +1<br/><br/>This is also my policy, depending on the group and game. <br/><br/>I'll invite 5-6 players even though I prefer 4. This usually means I almost always have 4, rarely cancel a session, sometimes have 5 which I enjoy less but isn't bad and once every so often have 6 which is less fun but then we can just play a type of session that's more appropriate to that number (rather than working against it).<br/><br/>This is also how I handle organizing events and parties.

If everyone can't make it to next week's game, we talk about what we'll do.  With some games, that's playing without them; with other games, we'll just get together and do something else; in still other situations, we may decide to not meet on a particular weekend at all (holidays, etc.) and instead agree to meet the week after next.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_360021">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360021/#Comment_360021" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-16T12:35:11+00:00" title="February 16, 2012 12:35PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Math is fun.<br/><br/>And it would actually be applicable if people were red and white balls in a lottery device.<br/><br/>But they aren't.

I was running a game with 8 people, including GM. I was way more likely to see 8 show up than 7. If 1 person couldn't make it, chances are that 2-3 others would say "well, if we don't meet this time that's actually good for me cause I have some ____ to catch up on anyway" and the session would get dropped.<br/><br/>Part of what made it work well was scheduling it every 2 weeks instead of every week. That way, game time was much less impact on everyone's schedule. Plus, the sessions were irregular enough to increase the longing to meet up again. So everyone was more invested in sticking to the schedule if possible. Nobody wanted to be the reason that the group didn't meet, unless they really couldn't make it for a compelling reason.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_360027">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nikodemus" title="nikodemus"><img alt="nikodemus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nikodemus">nikodemus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360027/#Comment_360027" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-16T12:59:14+00:00" title="February 16, 2012 12:59PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 16, 2012 12:59PM by nikodemus.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>And it would actually be applicable if people were red and white balls in a lottery device.</blockquote>\nExact numbers don't matter. The principle is solid.<br/><br/>In one game I'm just starting to run now I'm sending invites to 11 players, and first four to say "yes!" get a seat. Game is on if at least two can make it. If someone is constantly being bumped out we'll work something out -- if it becomes an issue. *fingers crossed* (I tried something similar last year, except instead of being first-come-first-serve I gave seats to those who had been in the least amount of games. It worked too, but the pool was big, and even people who <i>really</i> wanted to play had to wait a long time between games.)<br/><br/>In another game the group is fixed (five players), and we schedule only when everyone can play. In yet another there are four players, and we play if two can make it.<br/><br/>Guess which game we can manage to schedule at most twice a month -- sometimes once in three months? Guess which game I've just successfully scheduled thrice in three weeks?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_360032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360032/#Comment_360032" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-16T13:31:11+00:00" title="February 16, 2012  1:31PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 16, 2012 1:31PM by Felan.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Echoing others, I have a group of six players and we play bi-weekly as long as at least four people show up (but if there are only four I give them the option of a one-shot of something else like Fiasco or DW).

You can give an explanation for where your guy has been and why they are here now, or not. I really don't give a damn."  It worked marvelously.  The narrative, "team of adventurers seeks fame and fortune and hot dudes/chicks" was not interrupted by people being missing because the narrative wasn't about any single one of them.  A lot of time we just assumed they were off being wined and dined by some googly eyed nobleman/woman who wanted to get them into bed, and that had priority over punching elbow-deep into a gelatinous cube.

In Nobilis it is really easy to finesse people in and out of situations.<br/><br/>The game I ran last year was an experiment in several ways. It was ment to be a travelogue, basically, of disparate people all headed to the same distant city on the other side of the mega-continent. Somewhat Vancian mode. They would meet time and again on the road. It worked otherwise fine, except I found it to be really exhausting to run. Normally my energy is <i>up</i> after a game, but something about the setup just wrung me dry. (Since I'm naming games, it was running on Eero's Solar System.) Anyways, the idea was that they would be in a new place every time, with <i>stuff</i> developing between the player characters, and to lesser degree with a few NPCs: the continuing narrative would basically have been the drama the characters cooked up between them across the variable backdrop. I still think the concept is solid, but I'm not sure how to make it work.<br/><br/>The game I'm starting now is an old-schooly dungeon crawl using ACKS, with the westmarchian meta-rule that either everyone ends up back in civilization at the end of a session, or everyone can schedule a continuation within 7 days, or we roll on a table (inspired by the Jeff Rients' one) to see who makes it back alive and in what shape. Everyone knows that the purpose of the meta-rule is to allow a different bunch to play the next time.<br/><br/>The game that runs more slowly is Trail of Cthulhu, going on maybe 20th (15th? 25th?) session of the Armitage Files. It is not amenable to these strategies so easily, unfortunately. Still, the players are keen, so sometimes we manage two games a month. ...but sometimes there are long nasty breaks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_360059">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/john" title="john"><img alt="john" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/john">john</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360059/#Comment_360059" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-16T17:02:28+00:00" title="February 16, 2012  5:02PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 16, 2012 5:10PM by john.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for your suggestions -- I especially like your solution for the dungeon crawl.

In my real game, one player has more of a 3/4 flake rate while a couple of the other players are down around 1/8. Add to that social proof: when one person flakes that can cause a cascade. <br/><br/>It's interesting when highly abstracted math mostly jibes with real world experience, though. And those other additional factors just make things worse, not better. Bottom line - I shouldn't beat myself up because we're not playing that often, it's just the numbers.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: john</cite>Thanks for sharing your thoughts here.

We had 3 fairly hard-core players, plus myself. We also had a couple that were less consistent. This was probably the most successful game I've ever run in terms of consecutive sessions played and length of campaign. Due to the fact that it was also my *first* moderately successful campaign, I had a big problem saying no to people who were interested in the game, and as some players drifted out, others came in. At one point, I had- I shit you not- 12 player characters.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne night, almost all of them showed up.<br/>\n<br/>\nMan, that was a crazy night. It was also, looking back through the haze of time and memory, a pretty good session. I don't necessarily think that I was at the top of my GMing game back then, but I was definitely at the height of my rules-mastery, I'd learned to deal with having my plots shredded by crazy PCs, and I'd learned to improvise like a mother. Long-standing wall-flowers comfortably backed the plays of the main players, occasional wing-nut players threw their monkeywrenches, and new players got thrown right into the thick of the mix, with the full support of the rest of the players. Powerful NPCs were thwarted, millions of dollars of property damage were caused, and I walked out of there with a story to tell for years.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy did it work? I've never really thought that much about it, but I'll try now. First, the above-mentioned fighting trim I was in was a vital component. Secondly, though it's part of the first, is a complete unwillingness to back down from play, no matter what happened. Third was definitely that my hardcores (and I) were, well, hardcore. We were all young and mostly single, with no kids and no major demands on our evenings. The peripherals drifted in and out, but so long as the core was there 9 weeks out of 10, it worked.<br/>\n<br/>\nFourth, and possibly the most important, was a decision I made very early on in the campaign, and almost never (once that I recall) deviated from: Each session was one night of in-game time. Each session began at dusk, and ended at dawn. Each period of play was bookended, and the players often went their separate ways, to their individual havens, at the end of each night. The biggest benefit of this was that there was never any reason to handwave someone out of or into a scene based on shifting attendance from week to week. This allowed me to make it work when more than half of my player base was gone for 2-3 weeks in a row, leaving me with 2 players who were ALL fired up to play.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, I guess it boils down to: an ability to adapt to changes, a commitment to play, and a low barrier to entry and exit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_360352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360352/#Comment_360352" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-17T21:18:24+00:00" title="February 17, 2012  9:18PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wolfe, that is fucking brilliant.
