My name is C.J. Carella. You may remember me from assorted RPGs I wrote back in the 1990s and early Oughties for such companies as Steve Jackson Games, Palladium Books and Eden Studios. After a hiatus from writing, I'm getting back on the saddle, trying to start a new series of products, both novels and RPG supplements through a new company, Fey Dreams Productions LLC. <br/><br/>First up is my first novel, Armageddon Girl. It started out as a game setting for the upcoming Eden Studios sourcebook Beyond Human, and it grew and mutated into something bigger. I'm hoping to release the novel in October or November of this year, along with New Olympus: The Armageddon Girl Companion. I'm trying to do something different with New Olympus, a sort of hybrid between a short story collection and a non-system specific gaming sourcebook for the setting of the novel. Armageddon Girl is set in an alternate Earth where superheroes appeared during the 1920s and went on to radically alter history in the ensuing decades. <br/><br/>I've posted more information about the novel and the sourcebook on my website <a href="http://cjcarella.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://cjcarella.com/</a> , including sample chapters of the novel. I'll be launching a Kickstarter campaign sometime this August to help in the publication of the two books.<br/><br/>The reason I'm posting this (aside the usual shameless self-promotional ones) is to ask for some advice about helping integrate the setting with assorted game systems out there. I've been fairly out of touch with the RPG world since around 2005, so I'm still finding my way around. I'm hoping to eventually post game stats for assorted characters and special items on my website and maybe end up producing a full-fledged RPG based on the novel's setting, and was hoping for some ideas about what games would work for it, especially games by companies that wouldn't mind my using their rules to stat out characters on my website.<br/><br/>My apologies for the Wall o' Text, and if I breached protocol in any way, please let me know so I can edit or delete the post accordingly.<br/><br/>C.J.

Welcome to story-games.<br/><br/>I've still got plenty of your stuff sitting on my shelf at home. Quite a bit of it used for inspiration in a variety of games (even if it wasn't played the was it was probably intended). <br/><br/>The best way I could suggest to integrate your game with other systems is to simply produce the best possible game you can with a direct focus (don't try to do too much and water down your creative vision). If you've got a good game, you'll get some fans who do the work of hacking it to other systems for you. For a case in point, look at stuff like Apocalypse World and it's fan-base, and then look at the ways it's been hacked. Or flip this around and look at the dozens of variant systems that have been unofficially used to emulate a setting like Warhammer 40K.<br/><br/>If you build it, they will come. <i>(If you try too hard, they won't know what to make of it and they'll probably get bored.)</i><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419656">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419656/#Comment_419656" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-06T15:39:46+00:00" title="August  6, 2013  3:39PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi C.J.!  Nightspawn/Nightbane is still the best original setting Palladium ever published (it's like TMNT + Vampire, which is obviously the best idea ever). Glad that you've decided to come back to games after some time away.<br/><br/>Indie games circles don't feature a lot of generic systems that are widely played (being much more focused on specific rules implementations for specific games), but your best bets are probably Fate -- which is a Fudge offshoot and maybe the best generic system around -- and something involving the Apocalypse World engine. In terms of superhero games, I'm consulting on an Apocalypse World-based game called "Worlds in Peril" but we don't have a release date yet, so that may not help you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419664">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419664/#Comment_419664" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-06T16:38:53+00:00" title="August  6, 2013  4:38PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, welcome!<br/><br/>I wonder if "providing stats for characters in a variety of systems" is something that makes any sense to this crowd.

Glad to have you back in RPG land.  My take on system overviews: <br/><br/>FATE is probably the most broadly popular choice - it has many adaptations both in the story games scene and beyond.  It is open-license (OGL) and just came out with a universal core rulebook.  I think the most popular superhero adaptation is probably ICONS.  <br/><br/>Apocalypse World by Vincent Baker is extremely popular in the story games crowd with with a lot of adaptations (incl. Dungeon World, Monsterhearts, Monster of the Week, and more) - though I don't know of a superhero adaptation offhand.  It isn't open license, but the author has apparently been very free with giving permission for use.  <br/><br/>The Cortex Plus system by Cam Banks et al (Margaret Weis Productions, Ltd) was used for a Smallville RPG and Marvel Heroic Roleplaying (now going out of print).  It's proprietary, but they might be amenable to limited use of it.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419685">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cjcarella" title="cjcarella"><img alt="cjcarella" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cjcarella">cjcarella</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419685/#Comment_419685" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-07T02:08:12+00:00" title="August  7, 2013  2:08AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you all for the input.

Before getting back into design, I would recommend playing as many different games as you can with as many people as you can. Now that we have Google Hangouts, this is pretty easy to do. <br/><br/>In no particular order, I would recommend: <br/><br/>Powered by the Apocalypse games (Apocalypse World, Monsterhearts or Dungeon World) Probably the most popular Storygame systems)<br/><br/>Either Fiasco or Prime Time Adventures. (To really show off the narrative play style and to help kill character as avatar tendencies dead). <br/>The Sundered Land. (How many rules and procedures do we really need in play for a good game?)<br/>Grey Ranks. (Modern games can tackle serious subjects and do them justice with mechanics that support the fiction).<br/>Fate. (cos it's hot right now and it makes a great gateway game for trad gamers ==&gt; Story gamers).<br/>Contenders (I just got this recently and whilst I'm not a fan of cards in games because they are fiddly, this game has really interesting mechanics). <br/><br/>In short, play play play and see what others have managed to come up with since you've been away would be my advice.  <br/><br/>Stu.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420024">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neonchameleon" title="Neonchameleon"><img alt="Neonchameleon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neonchameleon">Neonchameleon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420024/#Comment_420024" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-14T02:51:35+00:00" title="August 14, 2013  2:51AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 14, 2013 2:53AM by Neonchameleon.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd second StuMC's list and also add:<br/>Dogs in the Vineyard<br/>Dread (Jenga version)<br/>Something from the Cortex Plus family (Smallville, Leverage, Marvel Heroic, the forthcoming Firefly (note: NOT the old Serenity system)).<br/>Montsegur 1244 (as a superb limit case).<br/><br/>Fiasco, Dread, and Monstegur are all one-shot games designed to take a couple of hours to play and requiring no prior knowledge of the rules.

What it does is takes some theme or aspect you want to bring out and does that <i>really</i> well.  Most generic games that are out right now are rehashes of older systems.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
