What I wound up with was a distant cousin to the Bard mechanically, but I still think it\u2019s fun to play.<br/><br/>I used Johnstone Metzger\u2019s <i>Class Warfare</i> as a template for many of the moves, but I wound up rewritting or scrapping many of them before I was done to give the class a better sense of unified purpose. One thing that I haven\u2019t been able to decide on was how to handle the core mechanic for Tactician. Should you get a few hold at the beginning of each battle, or roll for each maneuver you attempt? The former results in less rolling and more consistency, but I\u2019ve used this type of mechanic a lot, and I think some people don\u2019t like it. So, I\u2019m trying it out both ways. Which do you like more?<br/><br/>I\u2019m not quite sure to see how Tactician will work out in play yet, since it delves into territory covered by basic moves. I could use some comments or critiques if there\u2019s anything I\u2019ve overlooked.<br/><br/>Hold version: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwbHes6iNuGrM2phaEtnWGdwbEk/view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwbHes6iNuGrM2phaEtnWGdwbEk/view?usp=sharing</a><br/><br/>Roll version: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwbHes6iNuGrcThPQ05ycFpXRkk/view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwbHes6iNuGrcThPQ05ycFpXRkk/view?usp=sharing</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442728">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442728/#Comment_442728" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-10T03:27:06+00:00" title="February 10, 2015  3:27AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            They both look pretty much fine, balance-wise.

How do you see this class functioning outside of large scale combat?  Is the Warlord supposed to represent an experienced military leader, like a general or mercenary captain?  Does he automatically have access to an NPC army, or is he supposed to command the other PC's?  (This is a quick route to trouble in my experience).  Is the idea that he rallies a war band every time a fight is coming up? Can he take a war band into the dungeon?<br/><br/>Also, there's the old military saying that "Amateurs talk tactics, but professionals study logistics."  You could make military command a lot more interesting and varied by introducing some moves that address things like personnel issues, communications, and supply. <br/>For example, he could have a move called "Supply Dump" where he rolls +WIS to have  pre-positioned supplies in place when the party needs them, along with a few hireling guards.  That would make him genuinely strategically useful during a dungeon crawl, not just in a huge fight (which is a fairly rare occurrence in my experience).  <br/><br/>I feel like the mechanic of rolling before conflicts and getting holds to spend during the conflict is a bit overused, and can take away from the suspense -- if you roll well and get 3 holds, you can be pretty confident of winning, or at least not losing too badly.  I'd rather see the Tactician move work kind of like the Leadership move in the Apocalypse World Hardholder playbook, where the Hardholder rolls Hard when the conflict is at a crisis point, and they either get their gang to go along with them, or they fail and the crap hits the fan  So the Tactician move could represent the Warlord seeing that the enemy is trying a flanking move, and shouting orders to the fighting force to refuse the flank or charge on the left or whatever.  <br/><br/>That's intrinsically more interesting because the player is risking a roll in a highly charged situation rather than spending holds that they already know they have, and means they have to take the risk of a blown roll and hard move by the GM.  (There's a perfect example of this in a famous Civil War battle, I think Chickamauga, where the commanding General for the Union ordered one of his units to move over to close a nonexistent gap, which actually created a gap where there hadn't been one before, letting the Rebels charge right through the middle of the line.  The Union would have been totally screwed, if General Thomas hadn't rolled well and rallied the troops, becoming the "Rock of Chickamauga".)  <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442944">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Morrius" title="Morrius"><img alt="Morrius" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Morrius">Morrius</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442944/#Comment_442944" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-16T16:08:04+00:00" title="February 16, 2015  4:08PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>How do you see this class functioning outside of large scale combat?

How they would function inside of dungeon crawl is less clear. So, I may be deviating a bit too much from the core dungeon-crawling style of play. <br/><br/>I'm starting to worry that this class may suffer from "decker syndrome", or an over-sepcialized niche that excludes others. I think there's still some need for a tactically-minded fighter that isn't met with the core classes. But this may not be the best way to go about doing it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442946/#Comment_442946" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-16T17:41:35+00:00" title="February 16, 2015  5:41PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I like the first (hold version) better.

It was a partial re-skin och DW, so the Soldier straight-up included some moves from the Fighter and Barbarian playbooks. However, I did write some new ones.<br/><br/>For context, Soldiers in typical Redwall stories are sent from their stronghold to travel with the small party to fulfil some prophecy or other (i.e. the PCs), or are separated from their company as the story starts. So they aren't expected to be around large armies a lot of the time, but instead bring the mindset of a trained soldier to the team.<br/><br/>Here are some of the Soldier's moves, maybe you can use some:<br/><br/>Starting moves:<br/><b>Frontline Comrades</b>: whenever you fight alongside another beast, take this bond with them if you don\u2019t have it already: _______ is a trusty comrade. When you save someone\u2019s life, they take the same bond with you if they don\u2019t have it. (You can resolve these, but you might not want to \u2013 it helps you aid each other.)<br/><b>Commanding Presence</b>: when you lead a group in battle, the group shares 1 hold as per the Defend move. Any member of the group can spend this hold and have it count as if the group is defending them.<br/><b>Interrogator</b>: when you parley using the threat of violence as leverage, hold one more on a hit.<br/><br/>Advanced moves (lvl 2-5)<br/><b>Formation</b>: as long as at least one ally fights by your side, you have +1 armor.<br/><b>I Am The Law</b>:  (from the Paladin, but replace "divine authority" by "military rank")<br/><b>Watch Duty</b>: when you take watch, you treat a missed roll as a 7-9 result.<br/><b>Eulalia</b>: when you let out your battlecry at the start of a fight, everyone who joins in takes +1 forward.<br/><b>Top-Notch Equipment, Sah</b>: when you take damage, you can let your armor, shield or weapon take the brunt of the damage for you. Armor and shields have their armor value reduced by one, and should it reach 0 the item is destroyed. Damage on weapons are up to the GM.<br/><br/>(lvl 6-10)<br/><b>Don\u2019t break formation</b>: Replaces Formation: as long as you fight side by side with allies, you have +2 armor and all allies within your reach have +1 armor.<br/><b>Forced March</b>: when you undertake a perilous journey, you can lead a forced march. Don\u2019t assign a quartermaster or a trailblazer \u2013 treat those rolls as being hit on a 10+. However, everyone must roll to Defy Danger using CON.<br/><b>I Was Using That</b>: whenever you are disarmed, or when something you\u2019re using takes damage (even through Top-Notch Equipment, Sah), you take +1 forward against the attacker.<br/><b>Commanding Officer</b>: when you lead a group in battle, the group holds 3 instead of 1 per the Commanding Presence move.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442975">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442975/#Comment_442975" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-18T01:45:53+00:00" title="February 18, 2015  1:45AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>You totally need a <b>War Stories</b> move.
