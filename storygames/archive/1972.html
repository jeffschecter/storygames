                    From <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1960&amp;page=1#Comment_46002" rel="nofollow">What don't you understand?</a>
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Melinglor</cite>3) I don't understand Simulationism.</blockquote>
I mean, I can understand a lot of the impulse behind it, and I have to remind myself often that although I'm bored to tears by someone <i>else's</i> subject of emulation, I can be just as fussy about Middle Earth as they can about modern Covert-ops warfare or 14th-Century France. What I don't understand is where it fits into the Big Model, and how (for those of you who don't buy the BM) it interacts with other game preferences. For instance: it's been said that the Nar/Sim divide lies in Emergent Theme vs. Preset Theme, but I'd really like to know what that preset theme <i>looks like.</i> I mean, I can see how it can be a <i>result</i> of play where address is stifled, but as a <i>goal</i>? Do people really sit down and say (or imply), now, I'd really like to make sure our Theme is preset up front, so as to ensure that play won't be hindered later on by emergent address"?<br/><br/>On a broader note: is Sim (A) really a Creative Agenda like the others? The way I usually see it described, it's kind of like play that <i>falls short</i> of something else. Like, sure there's fights, but there isn't really any "money-where-your-mouth-is" Challenge, so it's Sim with fights as exploration tools. Or, sure there's moral themes, but we're just emulating the source material and not challenging or judging the themes, so it's just Pastiche. Now lots of people, including Ron Edwards, have defended Sim as its own kind of fun. But really, it seems like pretty faint praise, akin to "It wasn't amazing, but it was a good popcorn movie." or "Eh, it was good for what it was." is that all Sim is, a red-headed stepchild amongst better-loved Agendas?<br/><br/>Or is Sim (B) a particular non-CA preference that blends with other preferences? Like, "We wanna be faithful to Star Wars canon, and ALSO Step on Up"? or "we want rules-lite with very little handling time, and also the verisimilitude of living in pre-industrial London"? Sure, the violation of Sim fidelity may deal-breaking to some, but so can playing in non-high fantasy settings, or an overly humorous playstyle, or a game system that only uses D6s. it doesn't necessarily make it an agenda.<br/><br/>I'm looking for any and all input here. . .confirm or deny any misgiving, point out factors I'm missing, weave all these points into a coherent system, whatever. I'm hoping that people who are 1) Theory-thinkers, 2)Sim-enthusiasts, or 3) both can help me sort out these issues. Theoretically because I want to understand the Model in its totality, and practically because I think there's a lot of Sim-preference in my actual gaming buddies, and I'm wondering where that leaves me and my filthy hippie Thematic longings.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                </div>

                            Hey Joel--<br/><br/>The immersionists I know consider a simulationist approach to setting essential.  Having to assimilate startling new knowledge about a setting breaks immersion for those guys, so they want to have their setting well-understood, consistent, and established.  They don't want people narrating stuff into it.<br/><br/>So, I guess, in this case, simulationism is kind of an adjunct to the immersion.  I wonder what Merten would say, from looking at the My RPG Flaws thread he seems to be a flaming immersionist.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

Guilty as charged. I don't really know how to approach the subject - G-d knows I've tried - since it's kind of a huge lump of, I think, agenda, style of play, preferences, rewards and especially culture. I'm still not sure if I get the Simulationism in Big Model; it feels like a garbage bin where everything that's not Narrativism or Gamism gets thrown in. Having said and that re-read the Simulationist essay, it does make sense, though. I'll try to tackle this from character-immersive point of view - it should be noted that there are probably lot's of other stuff under the Simulationist umbrella, but I'm referencing to this one, since it's what I do. Also, I'm thinking this up as I go, backed up by some discussion on the subject.<br/><br/>The first thing that should be understood is that the main goal of Simulationist play is to <i>elevate beyond the fiction</i>. Think it as a virtual reality you want to absorb yourself into, and forget that you're Jack The Player playing a game. There is no game and there are few or none abstractions - there is just you and the virtual reality, inhibited by six million other people, or something else, depending on the nature of the virtual reality.<br/><br/>The second thing is that you strive to be a black box human. You simulate the reality by simulating a human (or something else), with all the human limitations, most notably, communication. Think yourself, as a real human person, in social situtation or something else; these are the tools available for you, in the virtual reality. There are no abstract mechanisms or procedures that would let you, the player, shape things or control things in the virtual reality. There are only tools available to the character - that is, pretty much the same tools available to you as a real human being. The tools probably wary from your real self tools, since character is someone else and the virtual reality is something else, but the basic approach is the same.<br/><br/>There is no story, no strive to create a story, or tools to create a story. A Story is an abstraction visible only to players and since you're excluding the players from the picture, you get no story. What you do have is a potential for intresting things to happen. See <a href="http://www.ropecon.fi/brap/ch14.pdf" rel="nofollow">Chaotic Role-Playing</a> which explains this better than I could.<br/><br/>I think those are the main how's, probably some of the why's and differences between, for example, Narrativist and Simulationist play.<br/><br/>So, to answer the questions, I'm leaning on the A) it's a Creative Agenda, because there are clear goals which don't really mix with the other mentioned CA's. So, why would someone want to elevate beyond the fiction and forget the player-self in order to do that? My personal answer is that it grants access to emotional content; when you're adapting a fictional person and putting aside yourself, you get an access to that fictional persons emotions, straight and pure. They are happening to you. There are probably other goals as well, but that's the one I'm mostly sticking with.<br/><br/>It could also be <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> in the sense that it can probably be mixed with other preferences and none of the CA's have to exclude other CA's. Mine does, so I'm not the person to get into this one.<br/><br/>Umm... I don't know if I really answered your questions or shed light to the subject. It's an difficult issue.                        </div>

                            I think a lot of people get caught up in the same problems with Sim as with Nar. They focus on technique level stuff and say "hey guys, it must be sim cos I'm using this technique!" In the same way that people point at Shared Authority and jump at saying "well, I must be playing Nar then."  <br/><br/>Immersion is a good example of something that to me is at the technique level, that people assume implies a particular agenda. It can be Sim, sure, and it is often used for it, but it doesn't have to be. For example, I've played in horribly gamist immersion-based LARPs, political brinkmanship games and the like. <br/><br/>I tend to see Sim as enjoying the fiction for the fiction's sake. How you go about following through on that is another matter entirely, though. I think the diverse ways of expressing that agenda cause all kinds of confusion. Expressing it as an interest in the way the world is modelled by rules, seems on the surface a radical departure from getting into the headspace of a particular character purely to enjoy that headspace.                        </div>

                            Sim is "getting it right". I say this as someone who considers a fair bit of my historical play as GNS-S, despite a lot of people swearing up and down to me that I don't understand Sim. With regard to preset theme vs emergent... if I'm playing a superhero game with preset theme, I'm going to feel cheated if beating things up doesn't solve problems. If I'm playing a superhero with emergent theme, I'm going to feel cheated if beating things up doesn't solve problems AND create new ones.                        </div>

                            Mmmm, re-hash.<br/><br/>Guys, here's the thing about Sim as a CA (yes, I'm talking about CA in the Big Model here, and that is all). CA's have processes that the group engages in in order to fulfill their goals. Nar has the Addressing of Premise; Gam has Stepping On Up; and Sim has Creative Denial. <br/><br/>Another way to put it is that both "the Right" and "the Dream" are equally important in the phrase "the right to dream." Sim is based on a process that filters (denies) everyone's input (creativity) into what the dream looks like/what the dream experience is. This is an active process; it's not sitting back and watching the pretty countryside scroll by, it's going out and changing that landscape to reflect your individual groups version of the Dream.<br/><br/>There are two big reasons why people have a hard time with this. One is that the techniques that people identify with Sim play are totally used all the time across the board (as has been pointed out). The other is that one groups enacted version of their Dream can be totally and sometimes violently foreign to another groups, to the point of seeming not even like the same activity. The fictional content of play for Sim does NOT seem to follow as broadly identifiable trends as that of Nar, for example. <br/><br/>But once you view it through the lens of why you're doing it, not what you're doing, it gets pretty simple. To me, at least.<br/><br/>I hope that helps in some manner.<br/><br/>(edited to add more xamples)                        </div>

                            I'm always tempted to write off Sim as some sort of strawman, but from time to time evidence of people playing and enjoying honest-to-goodness Simulationism appears in <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=22017.0" rel="nofollow">AP threads</a>.<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure simulationist play is just disproportionately underrepresented in our "new-school RPG design" circles. Simulationism as a CA has traditionally been pretty well-supported by existing game systems; thus, it's players drawn to the Gamist and Narrativist tendencies who are dissatisfied and have the appetite for a new way of doing things. Folks enjoying their simulationist play simply scratch their heads and wonder, "Why do <i>those</i> guys have such a bug up their ass?"                        </div>

It absolutely is a CA. It only seems to fall short of something else because you don't personally care about the things Sim people care about (and, in fact, those things bore you to tears, as some of your other recent posts have shown). Sim people probably think your Nar play falls short of something else.<br/><br/>Why does the defense of Sim seem faint praise? Because the people defending it in CA threads are generally Nar/Gam people who understand Sim at a basic level but don't get fired up about it. When they're actually Sim people themselves, they often are so caught up in the specifics of the specific brand of Sim they do, they can't explain the more general case to anyone else.<br/><br/>Reread what Nathan said. He has it on the money. I speak as a person who has taken part in a number of Forge threads about Sim where people on both sides agreed that everyone was on the same page (by the end of the thread at least).                        </div>

That could be because there really isn't that much to design, game-wise, with Sim. At least not much which hasn't been done yet, and re-invented couple hundred times.<br/><br/>Also, what Adam said about people in Sim talking about their specific brand. Sim is more about how you and people in your microculture (gaming group, or number of groups) play, than something definite, easy-to-take-apart design.                        </div>

That could be because there really isn't that much to design, game-wise, with Sim. At least not much which hasn't been done yet, and re-invented couple hundred times.<br/><br/>I completely disagree. I think there's absolute tons of possibilities for Sim design.

True. It also may not help that folks in those micro-groups aren't really sharing the info regularly with people interested in dissecting it, either.                        </div>

And you're probably right. Let's restate that: there's not much to design with the current design paradigms (resolution, procedures, resource management, and such). Although, there could be, I just can't see it.
<blockquote>True. It also may not help that folks in those micro-groups aren't really sharing the info regularly with people interested in dissecting it, either.</blockquote>
Exactly. Players in the same microculture are content, have been playing in certain way for ages, and it serves them well. New players can be introduced, if wanted, though learning process takes a while.<br/><br/>Conventions seem to have the notion of "we came here to play", not "we came here to discuss on how we play and improve it". Design-front seems to be doing a lot better with that.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnzo</cite>The immersionists I know consider a simulationist approach to setting essential.  Having to assimilate startling new knowledge about a setting breaks immersion for those guys, so they want to have their setting well-understood, consistent, and established.

This makes a lot of sense to me, and is a good explanation of Sim-aversion to free-narration rulesets. However, that still leaves the issue of game systems that <i>don't</i> allow one to just "narrate stuff into it," but which <i>are</i> geared toward addressing Premise. Or, to dissassiciate the issue from published games, a <i>play group</i> that doesn't do free narration but does address Premise. So the "Emergent Theme/Preset Theme" issue still looms large, for me at least.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Merten</cite>I'm still not sure if I get the Simulationism in Big Model; it feels like a garbage bin where everything that's not Narrativism or Gamism gets thrown in. Having said and that re-read the Simulationist essay, it does make sense, though.</blockquote>
I hear ya. My <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=15558.msg166169#msg166169" rel="nofollow">very first post</a> on the Forge was a posing of the question, "is Sim really it's own thing, or is it defined by absence," i.e. "Sim is <i>not that</i>." I was generally told (encouragingly, not "shut up"-ly) that I'd stumbled on the Beeg Horseshoe through independent reasoning. I just re-read the thread, and found it contains some wisdom toward understanding Sim that I'd forgotten--most notably MJ Young's renaming of the Sim priority from "Exploration" to "Discovery." But after all this time I still feel like there's an elusive something I'm missing, conceptually. As you say, I read the essay and the threads and it makes sense to me, then I apply it to actual play and I'm like, "huh?" Sorry I can't articulate it better than that.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Merten</cite>The first thing that should be understood is that the main goal of Simulationist play is to<i>elevate beyond the fiction</i>. Think it as a virtual reality you want to absorb yourself into, and forget that you're Jack The Player playing a game. There is no game and there are few or none abstractions - there is just you and the virtual reality, inhibited by six million other people, or something else, depending on the nature of the virtual reality.</blockquote>
That's a really articulate picture of Immersionism, Jukka. It definitely shows clearly the purpose of immersive play, and explains how and why certain play techniques clask with that goal. I don't think it applies to the whole of Simulationsim, though. It certainly doesn't apply to my play group, which is very fiddly about mechanics to simulate what "would" happen--look at some of the examples in my <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1974&amp;page=1#Item_2" rel="nofollow">other thread</a>. Immersion may be a subset of Sim, where rules-fiddlyness and clockwork-world building is another. Just like there can be multiple (and fundamentally incompatible) ways to Step on Up or Story Now, based on difference in techniques.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: hamsterprophet</cite>There are two big reasons why people have a hard time with this. One is that the techniques that people identify with Sim play are totally used all the time across the board (as has been pointed out). The other is that one groups enacted version of their Dream can be totally and sometimes violently foreign to another groups, to the point of seeming not even like the same activity. The fictional content of play for Sim does NOT seem to follow as broadly identifiable trends as that of Nar, for example.</blockquote>
Yeah, I agree with all this, Nathan. It seems to mesh pretty well with what I was just saying to Jukka.<br/><br/>(by the way, I hope you're not annoyed at the rehash. I've just got sme nagging confusion that just wasn't quite assuaded by the first--and secont, third, etc.--hash.)
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>It's not so much that Sim is a dumping ground, as it is that folks didn't get as fired up about it and design to it the way they did with Narr and Gam.</blockquote>
That seems to me to be the case, too. Perhaps this thread will be a springboard toward more rigorous Sim-think and Sim-design in the indie community?
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>I will say that I wanted to shout "Hosanah" to the heavens after the recent AP thread by Ron Edwards at the Forge, regarding<i>Dead of Night</i>. If you're curious about Sim and the concept of designing to it, you should really read that thread.</blockquote>
You know, I read that too and it sounded awesome. Likewise, the <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=22017.0" rel="nofollow">Werewolf: complete the mission</a> thread that Ron participated in was pretty insightful. problem is, though I read those threads and feel like I understand them, when I reflect later I've still got this confusion buzzing behind my eyeballs. I'm trying to identify and understand that buzzing.<br/><br/>I'd like to change gears somewhat. I wrote the OP in a late-night haze, and now I come to view it in the cold light day (and after being reminded of things like my old post and the Dead of Night thread), I realize that I get the "deal with Sim, in general, pretty well. So I'd like to zero in on the one issue that's causing me the most befuddlement: incoherence.<br/><br/>I mean , I can tell you wnat bores me to tears in at least <i>some</i> Sim play (in fact, <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1974&amp;page=1#Item_2" rel="nofollow">I already did</a>), but I'm curious what it is, from a Sim standpoint, about Gam and Nar play that ruffles feathers. I mean, concretely. I can assimilate a statement like "Nar theme is emergent, while Sim theme is preset," thus a clash--but what does that look like really? Actual play examples would be great, though a hypothetical would be sucfficient. Likewise Gamism: how does Stepping On Up interfere with Sim priority, and at what point is there <i>too much</i> Stepping Up? Because of course Sim players make SOME moral choices for their characters, but at some point it crosses a line. And of course Sim players make SOME tactical choices for their characters, but at some poiint tactics overpower the Sim, hence a line. Where are these lines drawn exactly? WHat does it look like in play when the lines are crossed? Do these questions even make sense, or am I smoking the Happy Root?<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>

<p>The king of MachallÃ¢m has become petty and corrupt. The PCs are a party of righteous adventurers who've come to the city to do something about this.</p>
<p>The GM doesn't expect them to make a choice here; he clearly lays out a route by which the PCs can get involved with the king's advisors and bring him to his senses by discussion and example.</p>

 I think I'm trying to say that the core act of role-playing, creating a shared imaginative space, is simulationist. Once the SIS is summoned up, some people may want to use it as a tool for some other purpose, others primarily value it for itself.                        </div>

Drawing the line is a personal preference, but I think most of them are or could be based on the thing mentioned in the Simulationism essay - internal consistency. How far would my character go? How would he react? This thing could happen, this thing is very unlikely to happen. The narrative play seeks to drive things to conflicts and intresting situtations, often - I presume - at the price of internal consistency. Wouldn't it be cool if... And so on. Gamist play seeks to achieve something against all odds and seek out a winner - and reward the player for doing this, often at the price of internal consistency. <br/><br/>Simulationist player happily sends his character home to get a good night sleep if it makes sense, even if there's a huge pointer of Awesome Here above the city. His character does not know or does not care. And tends to sleep a lot.<br/><br/>I'm just shooting at the dark with examples from the far ends of the spectrum, here. I don't really know Narrativist or Gamist play.<br/><br/>I don't know about preset and emergent themes; Simulationist play certainly has preset themes, but can have emergent themes. Again, I point to the article about chaotic play which pretty much is about adding a lot of preset potential hooks to a game and then seeing what comes out.                        </div>

                            Hmm. Does anyone have an example of Nar input into a Sim agenda that broke internal consistency? That's the big thing I'm wrestling with: I don't see Nar play as acting against character, but exploring a new aspect of a character, allowing a character to change and grow. How is that counter to Sim? Shouldn't characters be variable in their actions just as real people are, if the simulation is to be complete? How does a Sim player just "know" that a character MUST do this one thing (e.g. sleep, do paperwork) and <i>no other</i>?<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>

                            Hi Joel,<br/>
<br/>
Without wanting to sound dismissive or patronizing, I think you should read some detailed actual play accounts of Sim games, like the Werewolf game above or my own Vampire game I linked in the Werewolf thread. That will probably be more enlightening than abstract discussion. I mean, "preset theme" is not a feature of Sim, it's just a minor technique. A player just "knowing" that his character must do one thing is not a feature of Sim, it's just an Ephemera.<br/>
<br/>
Bear in mind that the question is what the top priority is. Sim is held together by the shared appreciation of the fiction. You won't identify that by looking at single Techniques or Ephemera. It's the Instance of Play and the social reinforcement you need to look at.<br/>
<br/>
There is also not much merit in seeking some example of an obvious conflict or clash. Most of the time, it's not that obvious. It's not like, Nar requires X to happen and Sim requires Y to happen. It's more a lack of sufficient common ground for appreciation and positive reinforcement, a failure to connect and get things flowing.<br/>
