There was 3 PCs on the first mission and 5 PCs on the second and third missions. We've had a great time and have loved the game from the start.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut debriefing the last two sessions we've been thinking that the game feels too <i>easy</i>. There has been one or two bit tighter spots, but the PCs have survived without resorting to Weaknesses. Rate of flashbacks has been steady, one Strength per session. With two levels gained among the players per mission, the total number slots for Strengths have been increasing mission after mission (and because the PCs who used Strength have got them too, one one has run out). It's felt a little bit effortless for the PCs, so far, even though the narration has been good stuff and the whole group has enjoyed the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, our first planet was a bit half-assed one (threat at 4 X number of players), but after that we've been playing by the book (as far as I know, I'm not GMing myself), AA at highest FA/NFA -1 (AA was 6 on the second mission and 7 on the third). Even with only one Strength used per planet we were quite able to wipe out the alien scum. If the players  used two (or more) Strengths per planet, there would be only couple of encounters per planet left to deal with in purely"usual" fashion.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre these experiences anomalies? Are the players just lucky? Luck might turn in the next session.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre we doing something wrong? It might be that the players have been bit "too" careful or non-competetive at times. Or that we've been too focused on killing aliens and not roleplaying ourselves into trouble between characters. Or that the GM hasn't been as tactically sharp as he should be.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr is this exactly how it should be?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165877">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165877/#Comment_165877" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-28T04:17:31+00:00" title="August 28, 2008  4:17AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you're having fun then it sounds like you're doing fine to me. 3 planets is just getting started. And it will definitely help to have 5 players when it sounds like only 2 of them have ever levelled.<br><br>Planets are easier, generally, at the start as you have enough resources and everyone (GM and players) is learning how to play. I think the planets will start getting tougher soon though.<br><br>The guys who have levelled up have raised the AA by doing so and have already spent through some of their (limited) Strengths. The guys who haven't levelled up are arguably in a better position.<br><br>I presume the AA will be getting nearer 10 soon (in fact, picking the "10" from the list is always a way for a GM to pick a sure-fire hard mission) and the GM will start to use abilities such as Regeneration, Ignores Armour, Lasting Wounds or any of the other ones that will put the party under extreme stress.<br><br>What abilities have the aliens had so far?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_165880">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AnttiKi" title="AnttiKi"><img alt="AnttiKi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.veljeskunta.info/anttiki/antti4_icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnttiKi">AnttiKi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165880/#Comment_165880" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-28T04:26:27+00:00" title="August 28, 2008  4:26AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 28, 2008 4:26AM by AnttiKi.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Gregor Hutton</cite>What abilities have the aliens had so far?</blockquote>\nReduced Visibility, Flee and Ignore Armour. As the GM I should also note that I've managed to ignore some very basic options in the encounters thus far, such as being able to change PC's range when the aliens beat them. Thanks for the reassurance, we'll start rotating the GM position now and aim for more challenging encounters in the future.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165882/#Comment_165882" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-28T04:49:36+00:00" title="August 28, 2008  4:49AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah cool.

Awesome.<br><br>Wait till they meet Swarming aliens or ones that cause Lasting Wounds (ouch!) or can Ambush or that have Exploding Bodies. And, for sure, move the PCs if it suits you when you beat them. Push some out of the encounter beyond Far Range and drag others in close for you to feast on. Induce Weakness can be a nasty one too... and Suicide can really sweat some Flashbacks out of them.<br><br>As the GM you'll always have more planets and you can use the Higher Officers to be more demanding in the fiction if they make slow progress on a planet ("Sergeant, your squad was handpicked for this VITAL mission after you carved down the Moon Beasts of Carravagio effortlessly.

Our way of gaming in abnormal circumstances over the net and in three-hour sessions has probably limited the pace of planet annihilation a little too much.
