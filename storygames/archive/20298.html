Whether or not he knew where to find this girl, Tiliva. [Implicitly, but not stated at the table: the innkeeper is the granter, the players are petitioners.]<br/>We went into the mode where you say what your character says; I was portraying this innkeeper.<br/>I was like, shuddering, and going "No, I don't know her! Who told you?" [Being a little transparent to set up the scene -- but by now, I can be pretty subtle and the players still pick it up.]<br/>And they were like "We think you <em>do</em> know something". [Implicitly, tactic: laying the cards on the table and asking for the same]<br/>And I was like, fearfully "No. I'm not involved". [Implicitly, tactic: flat out denial]<br/>And they were like "Who're you afraid of?" [Implicitly, tactic: good cop]<br/>And I was like "I just don't want there to be any misunderstanding. I don't want you to think I'm caught up with that glitch stuff. You know I hate it." [Implicitly, tactic: being clear, setting boundaries, identity politics]<br/>And they said "GLITCH! WTF ARE YOU IN WITH THE GLITCHERS YOU SCUM!" [tactic: bad cop]<br/>And I: "No, it's not like that at all, that was what I was trying to say. I was helping her, but..."<br/>They: "WERE YOU HELPING THE GLITCH? That's so wrong!!!"<br/>I: "This is what was afraid of. You guys jumping the gun. Look... I can't explain it but... I'll tell you where she is if you promise not to turn her into the city guard." [The innkeeper diegetically thinking: they'll understand once they see her. Tactic: bargaining.]<br/>They: "Sure, sure, we promise, now where is she?" [Tactic: false promise, deception]<br/><br/><br/><br/>Robin Laws' idea is simply to be mindful of motivations/desires and of "tactics".<br/>Guys as you know I'm pretty challenged when it comes to social skills.<br/>I was doing allright in my no-myth days but I had a lot of trouble portraying random shopkeepers in those first few sessions of The Lost Mine of Phandelver.<br/>I picked up Unframed and read Laws' chapter and everything became much crisper and better and more dramatic in the dialogue scenes, both the players and me did better just by me seeing the "petitioner / granter" structure and tactics exchanges in my own head, not even mentioning it to the players, just talking the scenes out old school style.<br/><br/>But after a new player joined he was really trigger happy with "I ROLL PERSUADE" "I ROLL DECEIVE" etc, and I was struggling a bit with it, the other players approached me and they were like "It's kinda frustrating that you need social skills to resolve social situations".<br/><br/>And I was like. OK. We need to whip out Hillfolk proper. I want to try it.<br/>And we tried it.<br/>And we've gone back to D&amp;D but informed by the idea of "dramatic scenes", even though they've nixed the drama tokens (for now). So far (two sessions in, since our DramaSystem game) it has worked very well.<br/>Heaven knows that I didn't have any social skills. But this way of thinking has really helped me and now I think it's helped the players, too.<br/><br/>PS.<br/>I know that Laws had fiction in mind, it grew out of Hamlet's Hit Points and analyzing cable TV shows.<br/>But it's also similar to the teachings of behavioral therapy on social skills.</blockquote>\nI'm actually less interested in Laws' advice than in the techniques for implementing it.  I think that being aware of intents and tactics during roleplay exchanges opens up all sorts of interesting possibilities, but every time I've tried it, I just get caught up in the flow of dialogue and can't label anything without pausing the exchange.<br/><br/>So, Sandra, if you could explain how you brought your various readings and thinkings and experiences playing Hillfolk into your D&amp;D game, I'd love to hear it!  <br/><br/>For example:<br/>Was it a matter of training habits?  Did you consciously say to yourself "tactic: laying the cards on the table" or "tactic: denial" during play, or is this more a retrospective analysis?  If it was contemporaneous, what did you do with that information?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447423">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447423/#Comment_447423" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-30T18:37:34+00:00" title="July 30, 2015  6:37PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can relate to Dave's experience.

(Hence it's a very good match with Kevin's "socialite challenge" tables.)<br/><br/>Then you just have to listen. The granter won't give it. What can does the petitioner say to get it anyway, and how does that change the granter's position? From the new position, what can the granter say now?<br/><br/>I have practiced this since last summer, which is when I read Unframed (I read it after our first LMoP session, I think, or after one of the first). I also spend a lot of time with mindfulness practice -- you guys know I'm very emotion-driven and that I value emotions and impulses over logic a lot of the time, and it's always been hard for me to "control what I am saying", to have a "mouth filter" so I just don't blurt out dumb stuff.<br/><br/>But that's OK. I just need to start "listening" to what both the petitioner and granter is saying. Are they coming at the problem from new angles ("tactics", in Laws' parlance) or are they repeating themselves?<br/><br/>So the question: is it a retrospective analysis? Most of the labeling is retroactive, but that's just the <em>naming</em> of the "tactics". <em>Using</em> different tactics is conscious, for sure. I think "OK, can I come at this from a different angle" and then say or act out something differently. I <em>sometimes</em> name the tactic (I might think "Oh, shit, the only way out ofthis bind is for the NPC to lie their hat off") or I might just think "Uh, time for another tactic" and sort of feel my way through to a new take on the problem.<br/><br/>Like when portraying the innkeeper: Before we started "acting it out" I had a conscious grasp on why the innkeeper was hiding their connection to the glitch girl.<br/>Then during the "acting", I thought "OK, hiding the truth is it not going to work because they have seen through the lie. He is pleading for his life at this point, but he still has an upperhand in that he had a reason for helping her while still being anti glitch". I didn't think "being clear, setting boundaries, appeal to identity politics", I just had the innkeeper do that because I started getting a "feel" for the character.<br/><br/>Training habits? Yes! I still forget sometimes. While it's much easier than I thought, it's still a bit of an effort.<br/><br/>What's interesting about this technique is that it works even if only one party is doing it. Leading with the fiction and staying in the fiction, but keeping the statements crisp and relevant because you're focusing on "they want something and they're struggling for it".<br/><br/>This can be an NPC asking the PCs clear out a haunted swamp: Do the players have their characters push against it? If so, try different tactics, try different angles. Appeal to their pride, trick them, threaten them.<br/><br/>Then let the dialogue land where it falls. There's no die roll or something afterwards. If the PCs are convinced to clear out the swamp, they are. If they aren't, they aren't.<br/>Same goes for you and your NPCs.<br/><br/>As long as you're clear about why your NPC isn't immediately giving in (and remember -- that can be a very good option, not everything has to be a dramatic scene) -- you can compare their motivation to what the PCs offer up in terms of threats, bribes, flattery etc.<br/><br/><br/>In D&amp;D a lot of the time the dialogue scenes are about the PCs trying to find out whether or not an NPC is telling the truth. In those cases, I never allow Wisdom checks to use "Insight" or whatever. I'm more about having the NPC deliberately saying contradictory things; doing my best to trick the PC but from the perspective on an NPC that maybe doesn't know everything the GM or the PCs know.<br/><br/><br/>Another thing this system solves is the old "The Dice contradicting the Cloud" problem of social scenes. The old "you make an excellent speech but then the dice bite you" or "You make a tame speech but the dice give it to you anyway". When I was a player in a WFRP3 game, with the funky "narrative dice", we started putting fortune ahead of the Execution in IIEE. I was pleading for my life, but before I started pleading, I rolled. The dice bit me, so I deliberately described my character's defiance in the face death instead of pleading, so I died. Same with another character, a speech maker, she rolled great die faces to make a really excellent speech so that was what her player then had to do (luckily she was a genius and Emmy winnner so she pulled it off).<br/><br/>But with this system, there isn't anything like that (unless you bring the drama tokens in, too).<br/>It's just about whether or not you can convince the other party.<br/>If you have <em>real</em> leverage, you don't need a dice roll.<br/>And if you don't, no dice roll in the world could help you.<br/><br/><br/>Guys, why don't we try to hash out some examples here in thread?<br/>Let's say you're wondering whether or not I am in possession of any treasure maps.<br/>I do, but I want to hang on to them because they are my only clue to find my daughter, she made the maps and then left.<br/><br/>Then you might ask "Old lady, do you have any treasure maps?"<br/>I'd then say "No, I don't."<br/>If you believe that, then the scene is over.<br/><br/>Let's say it's later and you have spied out that I really do have the treasure maps.<br/>You'd say "Old lady, we saw you with the treasure maps. We want them."<br/>I'd go. "What are you talking about? I have no maps!"<br/>You'd say "Drop the act, you bat. We saw them, through your kitchen window!"<br/>I'd go "That's some nerve, spying on me like that! Is that the sort of people I'm dealing with?" [This is "appealing to their character" -- not necessarily thinking "hey, I better use 'appealing to their character' tactic, just saying what made sense to say, felt right to say while being mindful of my old lady values and my old lady wish to hang on to my private maps]<br/>You might go "That's right, we are folks who hungry as crazy for treasure! Listen... how about we can just make copies of the maps?"<br/>I'd say "Any documents you may have spied are mine to keep. Adventurers, you should leave now. And count your spoons tonight."<br/>You might go "C'mon, it's not like you're gonna be able to get the treasure in your frail state. Let us make copies, you can get a share of the treasure."<br/>I'd say "The treasure I seek is not measured in coins." and I'd say, dropping the character voice and going back to my own:  "And she walks over to the lamp, pulls out a drum and starts tapping, tapping, tapping. What do you do?"<br/><br/><br/><br/>Awareness of tactics helps seeing when a scene is still crisp, full of things to find out, hash out, or if it's repeating itself and running on fumes.<br/><br/>In this case, this dialogue is still ripe with things to find out (will the PCs even find out why she is keeping the map for herself? will they get it?) but it can blend in and out with other actions, spells, attack rolls etc.<br/><br/>I'm no Frank Herbert but the above exchange was written as I came up with it line for line.<br/>It becomes even easier when there are two parties and you only have to do the work of one. It becomes like a Pong game, answering each others tactics with other tactics, or giving in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447425">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447425/#Comment_447425" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-30T19:53:30+00:00" title="July 30, 2015  7:53PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wish I could learn apply the same crispness and brevity to my own posts rather than spouting these LSD-fueled mammoth length missives. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447428">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Coalhada" title="Coalhada"><img alt="Coalhada" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Coalhada">Coalhada</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447428/#Comment_447428" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-31T02:05:18+00:00" title="July 31, 2015  2:05AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One useful technique for implementing this in-game is to watch for when you start repeating yourselves.

That's a great description of how it goes when it works.  I think that to turn conversation into gameplay, you need some sort of "take action-get feedback-take more informed action" pattern, and this is an excellent example.  I am wondering about the problematic case, though, when the players are the petitioners and they are not bringing in good habits.  <br/><br/>Suppose you're the GM, and to you, this old lady is a compelling character with a strong and interesting motivation.  You're ready to play her, and excited for a back-and-forth with varying stakes and tactics.  But now suppose that the player characters approach her with any of the following:<br/>- they repeat the same tactic over and over<br/>- they fail to take anything away from your responses<br/>- they try tactics at random<br/>- they can't tell whether they are wasting their time with no chance of success or not<br/>- their goal is vague ("tell us anything you know that might help us!")<br/>- they refuse to escalate beyond a certain point, but also refuse to take "no" for an answer<br/>- various other bad stuff that falls out from the above or otherwise erodes the fun<br/><br/>How do you deal with this?  Is it hard to notice what they're doing wrong?  Is it correctable within the fiction, or does it need to be addressed directly?  If directly, is it a "new playstyle" teaching moment, or just a quick one-off suggestion ("Try a new tactic!")?  Does some sort of intro need to precede play such that GM "how to play" feedback will be interpreted constructively?  Where do you draw the line between "this needs to go better" and "time to end the scene, which is fine"?<br/><br/>I think one problem I've run into with this is that bad habits are quite often survivable, but can poison the fun going forward.  Like, the players eventually get the info they wanted, but getting there was kind of a chore, and the next similar situation that arises, they approach with bland practicality or pessimistic irritation.

They want peace, and the PCs seem able to enforce it.<br/>15. They want protection, and fear someone involved.<br/>3. They fear their connections to events will be revealed.<br/><br/>The entries aren't really meant for on-the-fly use, they're part of like a town generator. (Unfortunately, it uses terms like "Scenes" in a way that is confusing to me and my porte-monstre-tr\xe9sor\u2013addled mind, unlike DramaSystem's use of scenes, which aren't prepared).<br/><br/>So let's talk about problems, real and potential. I have to be honest and say that after one year of doing it, I haven't noticed any problems (that doesn't mean there haven't been any; who knows what's festering in the unseen hearts of the players).<br/><br/>The only two things that happened is this:<br/>1. When one of the players was the DM for a guest one shot (on Greyhawk, with new characters, it was pretty good!), I tried this against one of the NPCs. The setup was that we had uncovered an assassination plot against the NPC's boss, and had been asked to join that plot. I was trying to report that to the NPC honestly and also speak about problems with the boss, that we might (in the future). The scene started meandering and, above all, became unclear. The GM seemed to think I wanted something more out of the scene than I was explicitly asking for, and it started getting flustered and confusing.<br/><br/>I stopped, went meta and said: "Listen. My intent here is just to convince him we are telling the truth. Does he believe us, and what are the consequences?" And we could wrap the scene up.<br/>(Later of course that NPC turned out to be a secret bad guy <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> but I wasn't fishing for that.)<br/><br/>The other thing was that we had a new player join the group, very trigger happy with the skill rolls. I don't use so many skill rolls because (for D&amp;D) I'm all about cloud-based resolution; like pouring out water to find traps etc. So one of the old players approached me between plays and said "We kinda want more skill rolls, now when there's a social situation, you need social skills to resolve it" (he was one of the players that had been very good at these scenes, but maybe he didn't know it, or maybe he was speaking on behalf of the new player).<br/><br/>I said "OK, we need to play Hillfolk", and we did, but I wish I had gone more expliticly into the "tactics" part. We did go in to petitioner/granter, though, so we'll see if future scenes will be better. The new player managed Hillfolk very well. Let's see if those skills transfer over to D&amp;D. It's too soon to tell.<br/><br/>So as I bite into your post, it's gonna be all hypothetical.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447433">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447433/#Comment_447433" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-31T06:12:43+00:00" title="July 31, 2015  6:12AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Suppose you're the GM, and to you, this old lady is a compelling character with a strong and interesting motivation.  You're ready to play her, and excited for a back-and-forth with varying stakes and tactics.</blockquote>\nFirst of all, this hasn't been my expectation yet. The NPCs are just dots on a map with a couple of lines on an index card (including a reference to the MM: <em>everyone</em> needs stats!). In the case of the innkeeper, the stakes came from a random table, and the same for Tiliva, and a later really excellent scene (between a blind guy who had a dying brother, corrupted by glitch).<br/>My use of this structure started from an encounter with a random shopkeeper in one of the early sessions of The Lost Mine of Phandelver. I was so flustered, I was like "We... eh, need heroes! Yes this town need heroes!" and the players were like "Uh... we're just level 1 dorks, we're no heroes yet." I didn't know what to say. Since I've gotten the petitioner/granter idea in my head, I usually do know what to say (or when to just meta past the exchange). It's weird.\n<blockquote>they repeat the same tactic over and over</blockquote>\nThis hasn't really happened yet but it's common according to the Hillfolk book. It says it's something to see as a sign to end the scene, to go meta and (in the case of Hillfolk) say "OK, did you get what you wanted?".\n<blockquote>they fail to take anything away from your responses</blockquote>\nThat's fine. If they don't get it, they don't get it. The game world is a tangled web, it's not a funnel that leads to one particular goal. Also, it's a lesson to me that I was too subtle, but that hasn't happened yet.\n<blockquote>they try tactics at random</blockquote>\nThe tactics typically flow from the situation in "cloud", their traits and their motivation. If they can rationalize any random tactic, it's fine. Don't see a problem.\n<blockquote>they can't tell whether they are wasting their time with no chance of success or not</blockquote>\nNeither can I, right? As I improvised the "treasure map daughter" example above (I wrote it line by line), I was surprised that the chance of success was so low. Sometimes I'm surprised that the chance of success is so high. "Chance" in this context is misleading since there's no die roll involved.<br/>If there's an impasse, something will usually happen. One side or the other will break away from the conversation.\n<blockquote>their goal is vague ("tell us anything you know that might help us!")</blockquote>\nThat's not necessarily a vague goal nor is it something that the spoon counting lady would want to deny them.<br/>I'd go "What is your current situation?" and then give them just the tiniest morsel that this lady could diegetically know.<br/>This is actually a pretty common exchange in my games, and usually brief. Not the most satisfying but that's where the events in the "cloud" led them.\n<blockquote>they refuse to escalate beyond a certain point, but also refuse to take "no" for an answer</blockquote>\nDo you mean "the PCs don't escalate, they give up, but the <em>players</em> don't want to give up"? Or what do you mean? It sounds paradoxical to both take a no and not take a no.\n<blockquote>various other bad stuff that falls out from the above or otherwise erodes the fun</blockquote>\nThen it's time to stop talking, have something happen (or say "nothing happens") and say "what do you do?".<br/>Like, I'd cross my arms, pout, and turn away in character, then as I left character, turn around and say "Well, that's what she does. What do you do?"\n<blockquote>Where do you draw the line between "this needs to go better" and "time to end the scene, which is fine"?</blockquote>\nThe line it is drawn very close to "end the scene, which is fine". Since we had three amazing scenes last session, maybe my expectation will go up, but I hope not -- the "it's fine" expectation seems more productive to me.<br/><br/>Also. It's not about being a great thespian (although I like acting and have played with actors in other groups). It's about your character's leverage and fictional position. Which...  if you get into it... might make you a good actor.\n<blockquote>Like, the players eventually get the info they wanted, but getting there was kind of a chore</blockquote>\nThe cure for this is to be very aware about "why can't they get it?". If they <em>can</em> just get it, then there's no need for a choreful scene. Just give it to them.<br/>And if there <em>is</em> a reason why they can't get it, then there is a legitimate challenge which probably won't be boring or choreful.\n<blockquote>So it's bad for the game in the long term, but because it often seems navigable enough in the short term, it often doesn't register for me as "address this now!"</blockquote>\nI have no idea what pessimisms are festering. Since the players complain so much about various house rules (I've done a lot of experimenting with initiative as you know), I asked for some positive feedback during DM appreciation month back in, I think, february, after half a year of play. I got compliments for "making encounters with NPC come alive", which made me happy.\n<blockquote>A similar problem (long-term lack of enthusiasm) occurs when one dialogue scene is fun and another one sucks and no one is clear on what comprised the difference.  "This one was fun!" doesn't seem to be sufficient without at least some awareness of what we all did to make it so.</blockquote>\nWell, I thought vague, meandering, goalless, confusing dialogue scenes sucked, and Laws' text solved that problem (as long as I can remember to use it). Other problems? We'll adress in due time I think. It's been like 100 times better.\n<blockquote>I have all sorts of thoughts about dice/clouds, formal/freeform, challenge/entertainment, opposition/collaboration and more.  For now, though, I'm just trying to understand what's been working for you, so I can enter those components into the equations.</blockquote>\nYou should know that your "Delve" comics have also inspired my way of running the game.<br/>Also "the Old School Primer", by, I think, Finch. I knocked the primer because it missed out on what I thought was the most important part of the OSR (the different play structure, the wider yet more proceduralized/quicker prep, the focus on exploration over story) and instead focused on things I thought non-essential. But now I do like it for what it is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447435">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447435/#Comment_447435" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-31T07:02:27+00:00" title="July 31, 2015  7:02AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 31, 2015 7:05AM by David_Berg.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Er, one miscommunication I'd like to quickly address -- the negatives I'm describing refer to "roleplayed dialogue where the players bring in bad habits and I don't stop them and the fun wanes", not "roleplayed dialogue" in general.

The reason the old lady doesn't want to admit to having the map is because it's got some demonic writing on it, which she fears may curse those who read it, and may have already cursed her.  If the superstitious villagers know she's read the marks of demons, she'd risk being burned at the stake as a witch.  She knows the PCs are not from the village, but still, she's not about to let her dark secret out to anyone.<br/><br/>The PCs don't know that she has a map, but they've been told by reputable sources that she "has long known more about the dungeon than any other".  They're looking for info about the dungeon's interior layout, the sorts of questions the old lady would pretty much need to stare at the map to answer.<br/><br/>Does that sounds like a viable situation to you?<br/><br/>I'm thinking of it as, "The challenge is for the players to overcome these hurdles and get a look at the map, for example by overcoming her skittishness, earning her trust, getting to the root of her unease, and assuaging her unease with some combo of genuine knowledge and viable deception."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447446/#Comment_447446" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-31T08:25:11+00:00" title="July 31, 2015  8:25AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, so immediately a difference in philosophy comes to mind (your view seems more explicitly "challenge-oriented").<br/><br/>This is a situation that I wouldn't plan, but may very well come up organically in play.\n<blockquote>for example by overcoming her skittishness, earning her trust, getting to the root of her unease, and assuaging her unease with some combo of genuine knowledge and viable deception.</blockquote>\nThis could very well happen. I don't usually think of solutions like that, but that sounds very typical of what happens in our play.<br/>It's similar to scenes that have already played out in our campaign.<br/><br/>However,\n<blockquote>The challenge is for the players to overcome these hurdles and get a look at the map</blockquote>\nthis isn't in line with my thinking.<br/><br/>They might talk to her, and maybe they'll find out about the map and even see it, or maybe they won't.<br/><br/>The dialogue could go<br/>PCs: "Hey, would you happen to know anything about the interior layout of the dungeon?"<br/>NPC: "Be careful of what you wish for, young hobbit."<br/>PCs: "What do you mean?"<br/>NPC: "All I know about the dungeon is trouble. You best stay away."<br/>PCs: "Huh... ok, thanks."<br/><br/>(That was improvised line-by-line. They didn't even find out about her mark of demons! Weird!)<br/><br/>Let's try it again:<br/>PCs: "We've heard you know more about the dungeon than anyother. Tell us."<br/>NPC: "Tongues run loose in the village. Don't believe everything you hear."<br/>PCs : "So, what <em>do</em> you know?"<br/>NPC: "I regret what I already learned. Don't fall into the same fate, travellers."<br/>PCs: "We can take it. We are strong in spirit."<br/>NPC: "That's easy to say, but hard to prove."<br/>DM: "What do you do?"<br/><br/>OK, so that one didn't go great either... but that is how it is sometimes! Maybe in this one, the PCs can prove that they are strong enough to resist the demonic writing and that they will protect her from the village's wrath.<br/><br/>I can afford to "pixel nag" because there isn't just one way to just one dungeon.<br/>I think two factors are at play here: my "throw a hundred darts and maybe a couple of them will end up bullseyes" prep ideal, and the subtle "micro-railroading" that we humans unconsciously do. We want people to discover our cool prep so we make it easy: in real life, the players could probably have teased out the information from me, it's burning inside to get out.<br/><br/>I can also afford to have deceptive NPCs. This isn't Simon's Quest where an NPC is just white letters in a black box. I'm revealing through body language and tone that she knows more than she lets on (I don't need to do this consciously).<br/>But it could've taken a while and it could very well have ended up like in one of the two examples there.<br/><br/>Let's try it just one more time:<br/>PCs "Hello, forest mother. We hear you know more about the dungeon than any other. Won't you share your knowledge with us?"<br/>NPC: "I don't know anything."<br/>PCs: "We think you do. Why are you hiding it?"<br/>NPC: "I told you, I don't know anything. I'm innocent."<br/>PCs: "Innocent of what? We haven't accused you."<br/>NPC: "I know what you're fishing for. Information about that demonic dungeon! Well, I don't know anything about that."<br/>PCs: "Who said it was demonic?"<br/>NPC [fearful, selfdoubt, hesitant] : "Everybody knows that! I don't know more than anyone else."<br/>PCs: "Well, it's the first we ever heard of it. Are you hiding something you evil witch!"<br/>NPC: "I am not a witch... Oh, goddess, let me not be a witch."<br/>etc etc<br/>The PCs could defeat or comfort her in this witchiness and then the map could come out. Or maybe they kill her and never find the map.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447447">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447447/#Comment_447447" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-31T08:26:40+00:00" title="July 31, 2015  8:26AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's impossible to predict what tactics the PCs will chose and it will lead to different places and outcomes.

Yeah, the "this is a challenge" orientation might be making a huge difference here.  It's certainly the only think standing between me and just showing them my cool map.  <br/><br/>Like you, I'm perfectly comfortable if the players give up quickly.  And I also think it makes for fun play when the players escalate quickly to dramatic things like accusations of witchiness (though my players would never do this to an old lady who hadn't clearly earned it).  Things only get tricky for me when the players are into the challenge: "Hmm, there's more here than meets the eye -- let's solve it!"  <br/><br/>I like supporting this, because when it works, it's great!  I can't always get it to work, though.  I don't encounter a problem with the outcomes, I encounter a problem with the process.  Just because we all realize that the players' wish might not be granted and that other options exist doesn't mean we're able to drop a challenge we're already invested in when it starts to grind.  You know?  The players are like, "We want to beat this!" and sometimes I'm a bit late or indecisive on saying, "Looks like you can't right now!  Maybe go do something else?"<br/><br/>So, even if you're not <i>looking</i> to build dialogue challenges, I'm curious about what you do when one emerges.  Like, this is interesting to me:\n<blockquote>PCs: "We can take it. We are strong in spirit."<br/>NPC: "That's easy to say, but hard to prove."<br/>DM: "What do you do?"</blockquote>\nBy ending the dialogue transcript there, you're implying that something happened there.  Perhaps that "What do you do?" is a key phrase, communicating to the players, "Now you have to try to meet that last demand and prove yourselves instead of just continuing to talk as you please."  Or, a less specific, "Stop talking and do something," or, "Shift gears," or, "Whatever you do next, you need to address the NPC's last statement, you can't ignore it," or something.  That sounds like a very useful signalling technique!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447454/#Comment_447454" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-31T09:06:32+00:00" title="July 31, 2015  9:06AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 31, 2015 9:09AM by 2097.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [wdyd as a signalling technique]<br/>Yeah, it's great!

Will you help us?<br/>GM: Mmm, yes, I shall pray to the gods for your success.  If you'll, ah, leave me to it...<br/>P2: Thank you!  But if we could also ask you to share your knowledge of the dungeon?  We are a cautious group, and this dungeon reminds us of one that nearly killed us until we had a map of it.  We need to know its inner details so we can plan.  Food, light, defensible positions...<br/>GM: Ah, yes, of course.  The entrance is-  Oh, you want to know what's inside?  I'm sorry, lad, I don't know anything about that.<br/>P1: The villagers say you have often demonstrated such knowledge.  Please, even if it isn't exactly what my comrade was asking for, defensible positions and all that, please tell us what you do know.<br/>GM: It's been a long time...  What are you going to do again?<br/>P1: Clear it out.  Kill all the beasts that emerge from it to prey on your village.<br/>GM: Oh.  Well, you could wait by the entrance for them to emerge...<br/>P2: <b>[Pulls P1 aside.]</b>  Is she <i>that</i> old?  I mean, is she <i>really</i> out of it?<br/>P1: I dunno.  The villagers all seemed to think she was extremely reliable.  Kinda seems like she doesn't want to deal with us.<br/>P2: Weird for a village elder.<br/>P1: Yeah.  Well, let's try to help her focus. <b>[Turning back to Vigdis]</b> Wise lady, it appears we may have caught you at a bad time, and if so, we apologize.  I assure you, however, that our mission is urgent and that we are quite capable of ridding you of this longtime plague.  If you will just spend a little time with us, helping us prepare, we will be quickly on our way.<br/>GM: <b>[Vigdis tells them a bunch of stuff about the dungeon they already know]</b><br/>P2: Thank you.  What about the interior?  What about beyond that first cavern?  We saw at least three passages, and the villagers said you knew which of them was most vital to avoid.<br/>GM: The- the left one.<br/>P2: Which one is that?<br/>GM: The one to avoid.  Or-  Or is it-  <b>[Glances to the right -- I'm thinking toward the bookcase in the room, but I don't immediately offer that info, as that would be a big flashing "go here" arrow.]</b>  Mm.  Avoid the left one.  I, I think.  It has been a while.  <b>[Players glare and clench jaws in frustration.  It doesn't intuitively seem to me like the characters have yet done anything which would overcome Vigdis's desire to get rid of them, but I look to see if I can find something, and settle on their promise of clearing the dungeon.]</b>  You really think you can end the plague of beasts?  Others have tried.<br/>P1: We have saved many villages.  We banished the demon curse of Harkethal; we killed the Wizard of Werville in his underground lair; we even killed a monster that dissolved wood and metal with its flesh.<br/>P2: As long as we can learn about what we face, we always find a way to defeat it.<br/>GM: Well... <b>[Another glance to the right]</b> I shall take some of my herbs and pray for clarity.  I think my memories will return.  Give me a half hour alone.<br/>P1: Very well.  <b>[They exit.]</b>  She seems scared of something.<br/>P2: Yeah.  Was she looking for an eavesdropper?<br/>P1: Or something.  Do you think she's evil?  Maybe she goes to the dungeon to perform spells and the beasts obey her.<br/>P2: Nahhh.  Well, you never know...  Let's listen in.<br/>GM: <b>[Narrates sounds of movement, drawers opening, leaves rustling, stones grinding.]</b><br/>P1: Preparing her herbs.  Or something else.  Can we see in?  <b>[They discuss various plans for climbing onto the roof etc. but abandon them.  Eventually we just fast-forward to the end of the half hour.]</b><br/>GM: My memory has returned, in part.  Here is what I recall: <b>[I figure Vigdis has spent most of that half hour memorizing what she can of the map.  She proceeds to tell them a few of the details that I remember, with some awkward pauses as she remembers stuff from the map that doesn't know what it is in real life, like X's and triangles.  I am wondering if the players will catch onto any of these "oops" moments, and they do.]</b><br/>P1: This is very helpful.  Thank you.  You said in that second stairway, there was something there?  A "try"?<br/>GM: No no no.<br/>P2: What were you about to say?<br/>GM: Nothing.  I told you everything I remembered.  The gods have only blessed me with that much.  Please, I am very weary, leave me now.<br/>P1: Look, it is clear to us that something else is going on here.  Is there someone you're afraid of?<br/>GM: The... uh, the ritual is taxing... that's all!  Are you going to go save my village or not?!<br/>P2: Is something going to come after you for helping us?  We can protect you.<br/>GM: <b>[Snort]</b> No, no, don't be foolish.  Please, just go, let me rest.  Protection.  What do you, what do you even mean by that?<br/><br/>I could go on, but I think you get the sense of the process here.  In my experience, this can go either of two ways: <br/><br/><b>1)</b> The players infer her interest in protection, follow that up, leverage their deeds and reputation to assure Vigdis that they are experts in protection from demons, and get her to show them the map.  Not only will they then have the map info, they will also diagnose the demon mark and assure Vigdis it can't curse her, thus winning an ally in the process who may help them later (e.g. vouching for them to some other village elder).  <br/><br/>The players feel that certain kind of awesome that comes from a well-earned victory.  <br/><br/>This is the part I love.<br/><br/><b>2)</b> The players decide that Vigdis has some village relationship that impacts her helpfulness, my hints that they're off base fall flat, they try to make deals with Vigdis for protection of her allies or destruction of her enemies, my hints at other directions also fall flat, and the players run out of ideas.  We consider saying, "That's it, you go all you could, move on," but then the players feel like they're so close, maybe they should just try another new tactic, perhaps some fake ritual, but how would that work?  <br/><br/>This is the part I hate.  <br/><br/>And then when they do eventually move on (or even succeed, if it takes too long and feels random rather than clever), it's with some sense of frustration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447458">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Coalhada" title="Coalhada"><img alt="Coalhada" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Coalhada">Coalhada</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447458/#Comment_447458" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-31T09:24:54+00:00" title="July 31, 2015  9:24AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 31, 2015 11:00AM by Coalhada.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ..                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447459/#Comment_447459" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-31T09:25:03+00:00" title="July 31, 2015  9:25AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 31, 2015 9:33AM by 2097.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<small>(Edit: this was a crosspost, a reply to David's post about What Do You Do.)</small><br/>That's great!

Maybe unconsciously (a la the "burning desire to reveal cool stuff" theory), but definitely not deliberately. If they go on a goose chase, wild or not, that's fine.<br/>\n<blockquote>they try to make deals with Vigdis for protection of her allies or destruction of her enemies,</blockquote>\nAnd she's not interested in such deals. Since you have her reason-for-not-granting crisp and clear in your mind, you can shut those other deals down with force, or let her have what benefits her out of it but it's not enough for her to reveal the map.\n<blockquote>We consider saying, "That's it, you go all you could, move on,"</blockquote>\nYes, this is the jackpot. Go to that place more quickly. You're close, but for now you can't do anything. Maybe her secret will be revealed in time, maybe it won't.<br/>Last Friday I had a backstory for the local glitch cult leader (that had ensnared Tiliva, the missing woman) but the PCs just killed her on sight (note to self: their first human kill, they're gonna need to update their traits to reflect that).<br/>Later they found out her backstory from someone else when they asked around. Grist for the "burning desire" theory, almost to the point of quantum ogre [James and Jason, the Quantum Ogre means when you have some encounter that you want the PCs to show so you change reality so that they get there no matter what decisions they make]. <img alt=":/" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/confused.png" title=":/"/> But hey, it was reasonable, they asked someone else who had been involved in the ritual.<br/><br/>Same here. They didn't find out about the map. There are a hundred things in the world that they don't know about. This is one more. You got an interesting scene out of it.

Out of the twelve example leverages, the first three are practical and the the last few are social.<br/>Leverage isn't the same as a potential emotional concession.<br/>And resistance and leverage isn't the same thing, either. Leverage is what you use <em>against</em> resistance. You move on quickly when there's no resistance. When there is strong resistance, but no leverage, you can bounce against the wall for a bit. Then the concession is that the petitioner didn't get their wish (because they didn't have enough leverage). The petitioner would get the drama token if it was an emotional request and we were playing DramaSystem. In games without drama tokens, just nothing happens. It's still a worthwhile scene.<br/><br/>It's like the example in Hillfolk (and this is an scene about an emotional petition) on page 29. Delia has no leverage and doesn't get a concession. Lack of leverage doesn't mean no scene. Lack of resistance does.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Coalhada" title="Coalhada"><img alt="Coalhada" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Coalhada">Coalhada</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447468/#Comment_447468" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-31T10:24:58+00:00" title="July 31, 2015 10:24AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 31, 2015 11:04AM by Coalhada.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ..                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Coalhada" title="Coalhada"><img alt="Coalhada" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Coalhada">Coalhada</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447469/#Comment_447469" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-31T10:27:55+00:00" title="July 31, 2015 10:27AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 31, 2015 11:01AM by Coalhada.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ..                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447470">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447470/#Comment_447470" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-31T10:30:58+00:00" title="July 31, 2015 10:30AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, first to answer your cross edit.<br/>I agree with seeing DS in framework terms, but as a framework to create social and above all emotional conflicts. This is a very valuable framework and I've been itching lately to bring it into D&amp;D, to have these sorts of emotional characters and concessions.<br/><br/>However, the resolution system in Unframed is just that, a resolution system ("Trade tactics until one tactic works or its clear that no tactic will work") that's used in DS also. <br/>Since that resolution system might get a little one-sided over time if relied solely upon, DS also introduces the drama tokens and the forced concessions. They are less needed in NPC vs PC discussions, and they're less needed in a system with a focus on procedural scenes. If there is a <em>lot</em> of PvP, I can see their appeal for sure, and I do like PvP scenes so I'm thinking of bringing them over.<br/><br/>The "forced concessions" aren't used every scene, and (unlike Fiasco), the drama tokens on their own don't resolve the scenes, they are awarded post-hoc after identifying the concession/lack of concession. The main resolution system (used whenever there <em>isn't</em> a forced concession) is the same that is posited in Unframed.<br/><br/>Now to answer your follow up post.\n<blockquote>A scene with no leverage at all is the same as a scene with no resistance but with the opposite result. <br/>All the leverage examples are 'emotional' in DS terms (which uses a somewhat loose definition of the term TBF). Even if you are simply accepting a bargain, you're conceding the rightness of your counterpart's position. </blockquote>\nThat's a semantic quagmire that I'm not willing to enter.<br/><br/>However, my position is this:<br/>When there is no resistance, you can still have a brief scene, a brief "Oh, yes, of course, the map, here it is".<br/>When there is no applicable leverage, you can still have a longer, interesting scene because the mystery is, as always, "Is there <em>enough</em> applicable leverage?" You don't really know whether or not there is applicable leverage until you start the scene and see what the petitioner brings to the table.<br/>If it turns out there is no leverage, well, then the scene ends.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447471">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447471/#Comment_447471" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-31T10:35:03+00:00" title="July 31, 2015 10:35AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll grant that DramaSystem frames its needs and concessions in emotional terms, to the extent of redefining desires from practical ("I want to invent writing") to emotional ("I want to be respected") terms.<br/><br/>But the resolution system ("trading tactics") itself doesn't concern itself with solely emotional terms, and as phrased in Unframed, applies equally well to both practical and emotional requests.

I agree with that.<br/><br/>You're saying Unframed's essay is a step back from that. I agree with that as well, if "back" doesn't mean "worse". It extracts a surprisingly small core from the whole of DramaSystem -- and the rest of DramaSystem, that it throws out, is still worthwhile. But it's its own thing, and the extracted core can work marvels on its own.<br/><br/>You're saying that Unframed's essay leads back to ongoing argumentative stances. In PvP, sure, maybe you're right, but clearer and with methods to sometimes be able identify repetition and resolution if or when they occur. In PC vs NPC, naw. That hasn't been my experience at all. It has led to some pretty darn excellent play.<br/><br/>Don't misinterpret me as saying "Robin says this, Robin says that", I'm just saying that dropping the divide between emotional and practical has served me well for the last forty sessions or so of D&amp;D.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html

Go to that place more quickly.</blockquote>Well, let me explain the reasons why I don't.  Not because my way is right, but because I'd like to hear your take on the fine details of how and when to call the scene finished.<br/><br/>The reasons why I am often slow to jump in and say, "You got all you could, move on," include:<br/>- I too am caught up in the players' struggle!  Will they get the map or won't they?  "I still want to know... they might be close*... hey, wait, this became not-so-fun somewhere along the way... oops."<br/>- It feels arbitrary.  In the scope of the overall game, it's anything but arbitrary, but from "within" the challenge, for those who are tackling it, the ending to that effort arrives in a way that is arbitrary to the challenge endeavor itself.**<br/>- It leaves a bad taste.  Without any formal measures of how the challenge proceeded and concluded, the last impression is simply, "This isn't fun anymore, let's stop."  I try to remember to emphasize the good parts ("Hey, you learned about the first set of tunnels!  Good job!  This wasn't a waste of time at all!") but sometimes that works better than others.<br/>- No one is eager to be the bringer of that bad-taste ending.  My rule is "most bored person wins", but even so, the most bored person at the table may hesitate if they're not sure if everyone else is bored too.  A simple question could work ("You guys running out of steam here?"), I suppose, but that hasn't come naturally, and I'm guessing it's because no one is eager to bring the bad taste.  Sometimes I make it the GM's job (I prefer that everyone be equally accountable for the fun, but sometimes clear division of labor is worth the compromise), but knowing that something is your job doesn't always make you eager to do it.<br/><br/>* Hmm, maybe an arbitrarily-invoked "snatch victory from the jaws of defeat" procedure would go over better than an arbitrarily-invoked defeat.  Perhaps the key is to end the free roleplay without necessarily ending the scene/challenge immediately.  Is "What do you do?" ideal for this?<br/><br/>** I suppose that during the intro to play, I could try to establish "as long as it's fun" as a more formal constraint on open-ended challenges.  "You run out of things you can try which are actually entertaining," could be an explicit "lose" condition.  I'm not going to do this in Delve for immersive player vs character reasons, but I figured it was worth mentioning.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447494/#Comment_447494" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-31T20:56:46+00:00" title="July 31, 2015  8:56PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 31, 2015 8:58PM by 2097.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1. I am the most easily bored participant in any group I've been in, since I moved to this city at least. So I've got my ear to the bore-ground.<br/><br/>2. But it's not necessarily about boredom. It's about having tried all your ideas. Convey everything and tried everything.<br/>Tonight I played with three new players in a new group, I was a player. I liked the people, but it was the most railroady bull I have ever seen or imagined. But here's an interesting thing. Our defeat of the big bad was a bit weird and we found ourselves in an empty room, with an unconscious (actually dead, but we didn't know) monster behind a magical barrier that we couldn't cross. The GM had in his mind that we were done, that we should leave the mountain and go back. But he didn't convey this. I was the first to go "Ok, we've tried everything, let's leave\u201d. Which turned out to be right. We believed we still had to break the barrier but actually the barrier was a force of good.<br/>So boredom and "we've tried everything" was connected.<br/><br/>And "what do you  do?" isn't necessarily about <em>ending</em> free roleplay. It's more of a prompt, a \u201dreassess your options". But sometimes you can remind the players of those options.<br/><br/>I guess I don't really see that map lady scene as such a disaster. They can still go back. There are always threads dangling that they can save for later or pull now.<br/><br/>In the \u201dbarrier room\u201d case tonight, I reasoned similarly. We could go out and see. Find out any dangling threads.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447495">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447495/#Comment_447495" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-31T21:08:21+00:00" title="July 31, 2015  9:08PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nah, "disaster" would be a clear overstatement, and the lingering threads are fine.

(Pity some of the posts were deleted! I would have liked to read them.)<br/><br/>Two observations:<br/><br/>1. It's very interesting how you both, in your examples, go to great efforts to telegraph "hidden" information to the players. Certainly not a technique I would expect every GM to use, although it's very good for this.<br/><br/>How key is it in this kind of scene?

I'm very curious how this all interfaces with the whole Myth/No-Myth discussion. How much of this is prepped beforehand? Which prep improves play?<br/><br/>I've seen some attempts to, for instance, make a list of things which will get an NPC give in and surrender information (or whatever).<br/><br/>It could also take the form of a rubric (e.g. "Guarantee of safety", "non-threatening demeanour", "mention of granddaughter"; two of the three are sufficient to get the NPC to fess up) or checklist.<br/><br/>I've never tried this in practice, because it just seems like too much work, but it's interesting to ponder ways to "prepare" social challenges.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447499/#Comment_447499" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-31T21:49:06+00:00" title="July 31, 2015  9:49PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 31, 2015 9:49PM by David_Berg.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Waugh!

"Look, adventurers, you've already asked me to search my memory and you've already offered me protection, and now you're just doing it again in different words.

Is an old lady in a medieval village going to be so clear in her thoughts and words?  It doesn't feel right to me.  So instead, I say stuff like, "I'm tired, I've done my best, please leave me," and the players don't get that this refers to their tactics, not just to the NPC's general disposition.<br/><br/>Perhaps I could try to train myself to combine my vaguer NPC speech with some more concrete supplemental signals.

Just knowing motivations, likely reactions, and so on. What kinds of things would she react to? If so, how? What does she know? Who is she friends with? What's her past like?<br/><br/>In other words, an NPC is just a more-complicated version of a mirror (imagine coding a computer game, and you can quickly see how). There's no categorical reason for why one should be prepped and not the other, however; each are objects in the imaginary space that you can interact with, and an "objective" approach to handling one which doesn't call on GM-whims-in-the-moment is ideal for a GM who is struggling with mental hygiene.<br/><br/>Incidentally, this is also why OSR folks are really big on Reaction Rolls. <br/><br/>If you think about it, there's no reason you couldn't use Reaction Rolls for objects like a mirror, as well.<br/><br/>It sounds like for you prepping a mirror relieves tension/stress, whereas prepping an NPC seems like an area where you don't need to do anything, because you don't know what the players will do. It's shades of grey fading into each other, in other words, and personal preference coming to the fore.<br/><br/>(Sidenote over!)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447542">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447542/#Comment_447542" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-02T02:57:53+00:00" title="August  2, 2015  2:57AM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now, and this is what I was aiming that whole sidenote at in the first place:<br/><br/>Let's imagine a magical mirror, which may, perhaps, hide some secrets (if nothing else, that could be "its function").<br/><br/>Let's apply the petitioner/granter method to a character interacting with it.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Yes?<br/><br/>What tactics or strategies might the character bring to bear?

One thing that makes this work isn't to just go "What are you saying exactly?" but instead just answer in character. The players says "Ok, I guess we tell her to take us to the dungeon" and then you answer "Take you to the dungeon? Why should I?" or similar. I actually accidentally answered out of character the other day ("she says something about the vineyard"), the players kept talking into character and it brought me back into it.<br/><br/>Just like how someone standing with crossed arms and pretty soon the entire room is doing the same.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462497">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462497/#Comment_462497" name="Item_102" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-26T15:52:14+00:00" title="April 26, 2017  3:52PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's been almost a year since the last necro, but\u2026<br/>One of the players who was present for all of this\u2026<br/>We took a break for about half a year and now we're gearing up for a new campaign (see "Currently prepping").

Conversations for him are an obstacle to overcome, so you as a Player have to actually convince another human being that your idea/plan/argument is effective.<br/>This is veeery difficult to do in an rpg <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/><br/>And while the GM is supposed to somehow help you get there, most PC-vs-PC (thus Player-vs-Player) discussions end up in an impasse (and feel not fun).<br/>Rules are there to cut through this.<br/>Because fictional characters might change their mind for a host of reasons, and as far as a decent story goes they should, but people at the table usually won't :P<br/><br/>And your Player, I would bet, simply wants rules back into the mix so he can know "how things work" and can feel a measure of control again.<br/>Free roleplay is fun, but the moment I actually care about the outcome, being in control is important... and if the GM just calls all the shots, then there is no way a Player can ever be in control.<br/>The game then shifts towards appeasing the GM's tastes, so that the GM will deem your ideas/arguments/plans good, and they will succeed (unless the GM has other plans, of course).<br/>Rules give Players a (more or less illusory) sense of safety and control.<br/><br/>It's interesting, because it's the reverse of OSR play.<br/>There you always roll, which is pretty random and tends to fuck you up, so you try avoiding rolling dice by feeding the GM your amazing ideas and dialogues ... if they are deemed good enough things just happen with no rolls.<br/><br/>Here, Players want more rolls back in the mix because they are the only clear rules they see, the only elements they feel like they can understand, calculate, predict, control.<br/><br/>That, at least, would be my bet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462568">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462568/#Comment_462568" name="Item_104" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-28T08:52:54+00:00" title="April 28, 2017  8:52AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I talked this through with the player and we got on the same page again (my side <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> )<br/><br/>I think the comparison that I've brought up before about searching for traps or searching for treasure in the finchian style is pretty apt.<br/><br/>Let's say the random table gives the result where the NPC knows nothing, but pretends to play coy in order to be able to make up some false info to get some money out of the PCs as a reward.<br/><br/>Then we can talk that scene out using Laws' techniques and it's an interesting scene in and of itself.<br/><br/>And I'm not "deciding" the outcome anymore than I "decide" that the player who steps on a white square instead of the red, traped square, avoids triggering the trap.<br/><br/>In one sense, yes, I decided to trap that square when I made that dungeon (or decided to run a purchased dungeon).<br/>But that's not "<em>story</em> before", that's <em>facts</em> before.<br/><br/>And in another sense, yes, it's my job to convey the layout of the room, the colors on the floor, to clarify from the players so I know what they're stepping on. As a referee, I "decide" what's happen but it's not in a story-telling capability.<br/><br/>I think this is also why I think prep is so important in this idiom. Because the combination of referee and improviser becomes extremely unfair; unlike other idioms where the GM can be an improviser without problem.<br/><br/><br/>As for the OSR-ness of it. I'd argue that this goes back to Breeyark and, again, to trap-finding in the finchian style. But, if I do something in a different way than any particular historical record, I'm good with that as long as the way I'm doing it is <em>good</em>.<br/><br/>I gave the player those pages from Unframed. It hasn't been fair that the "rules" have been there, but invisible.

Including staples such as lying, appealing to authority, appealing to morals, threats, insults, flattery etc.<br/><br/>And every move the petitioner makes can have one of two consequences:<br/>\u2022 The granter gives in<br/>\u2022 The granter has a countermove (that the petioner can try to counter in turn until the stack is resolved)<br/><br/>And every move the granter makes have one of three consequences:<br/>\u2022 The petitioner gives in<br/>\u2022 The petitioner has a countermove (that the granter can etc etc)<br/>\u2022 The petitioner considers this particular stack resolved or paused and tries a new, different move<br/><br/>Now, there are some points that are subjective:<br/>\u2022 Whether the countermove is a valid countermove. For plausably mimetodiegetical corner cases, these uncertainties are best resolved in-fiction with a countermove to the countermove. For complete non-sequiteurs, like "Give us the map" - "Pink dromedaries are orange" the players of course will call shenanigans.<br/>\u2022 Whether or not the NPC would, with their info and capabilities, have the countermove available. Would the town guard think of that particular reply? This is a referee call just like handling searching for a trap in the floor. But, in general having the NPCs be competent makes them feel more real and alive and for cornercases, see "valid countermove' above.<br/>\u2022 Whether or not the NPC even should countermove instead of just give in. This, I feel, is sufficiently handled not only by the two above points of move validity and move availability, but by applying Linehans checklist for intensity. Does the town guard <em>really</em> care that much about what the PCs do?<br/><br/>The meta rule of listening for repetition breaks up a lot of stalemates.<br/><br/>Generally I find this method to be crisp, razor-sharp and unambiguous, with built-in methods to identify and resolve uncertainty and subjectivity.<br/><br/>Again, the method is predicated on having a clear handle on the NPC, what they know and what they want. If that's not there, the "move availability" can be hard to determine properly and same can be said for the "intensity" a la Linehan.<br/><br/>Note that "intensity" in her model doesn't mean intenseness in emotional expression, but is more about stubborness, not giving in, clarity etc \u2014 it's about how you "choose your battles" more than how you "fight" them.<br/><br/>Laws has a binary model for it: is there conflict or no conflict \u2014 Linehan is more nuanced but her checklist makes it somewhat quantifiable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462724/#Comment_462724" name="Item_107" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-01T08:46:35+00:00" title="May  1, 2017  8:46AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Btw, Hasimir,  great post, and to be clear: I disagree with your interpretation of the system, so I wanted to clarify where my interpretation differs.<br/><br/>It looks and sounds like "free roleplay" but things are going on in the DM's brain where the outcome is more structured.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462725">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462725/#Comment_462725" name="Item_108" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-01T09:03:46+00:00" title="May  1, 2017  9:03AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And you have correctly identified a snag.

You try to develop awareness of whether things are going in circles and repeating itself, and if it does, change tack.
