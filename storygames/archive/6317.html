I've identified myself (since discovering the Forge, Story-Games, and the community) as primarily interested in Simulationist play, leaning towards Narrative, with Gamist as a distant third, but I'm partnered with a (and have many friends who are) hardcore Gamist of the Old Skool type.<br/><br/>As such, I've tried to reach out, expand my horizons, and try playing more Gamist-oriented stuff, which I haven't touched since I was in high school.<br/><br/>And hey, look, I liked it.  And so did a lot of other people from the looks of it.  The frequency of posts regarding Moldvay and the RBH seem proof of this.<br/><br/>At one point, we picked up Descent, which is basically old school D&amp;D as a board game.  It was great in a lot of ways -- instant character creation (pick a card!), this snap-together puzzle maze maker thing, pre-built scenarios.<br/><br/>Ultimately, however, we found that (1) setup took forever, (2) the game itself took forever, and (3) it was really, really overbalanced towards the players versus the DM, such that once we found certain combinations of objects, we couldn't lose.  We're thinking of trying it again at some point with the expansions, if they can solve the third problem.<br/><br/>Moldvay presented us with different issues.  The adventure/dungeon generator?  Loved it.  Really fast character creation?  Great.  The actual combat?<br/><br/>Well, not so much...<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=6017&amp;page=1#Item_0" rel="nofollow">This post</a> really resonated with us.  Mike Holmes' comment that we should be playing something else if what we're playing doesn't work also did so.<br/><br/>Our biggest issue was, as noted in that post, the rock-em, sock-em robots nature of the combat (roll, miss, roll, miss, roll, hit, damage).  James Nostack's request for something more abstracted seemed liked a good idea.<br/><br/>I understand Rich Forest's comment that Moldvay RB's "unit of adventure" in D&amp;D isn't the combat round or the encounter: it's the expedition.  But clearly some gamers are interested in a system where combat *is* such a unit. <br/><br/>In the meantime, we've tried out the RBH, and though we really liked a lot of it (the tokens, the zones, the skills, the advantages of certain weapons in certain situations), it still felt very swing, hit, swing, miss.<br/><br/>Mike's reference to Hero Quest interested me.  I'd never read the book (though I'd certainly heard of it), and the idea of purely abstracted Advantage (in the manner of D&amp;D's Hit Points, but taken further) sounded neat.<br/><br/>So I borrowed HQ from a friend (thanks Mike O!) and came to two conclusions:<br/>1. The advantage mechanic was interesting.<br/>2. I don't think I'll ever want to play HQ.<br/><br/>While I liked the ideas that were put forth by the HQ rule set, I had some real issues with it: it seemed very complex; I didn't like how advantage from one fight could be carried over to the next (I knock him over!  I gain 30 AP!  Now I can use that when I fight the next guy!); and I especially didn't like how complicated character creation was.  All of it seemed very grounded in Glorantha: great for HQ, but not so much for a generalized, abstracted system.<br/><br/>So I realized that I wanted something that had the almost-instant character creation of Descent, and an abstracted combat system akin to HQ, with the camera pulled back enough such it wasn't always interested in individual blows.<br/><br/>So, last week, I threw something together, and we tried it out this weekend.<br/><br/>It was...interesting.<br/><br/>I don't know what I've got, but it seems a step in the right direction.  We tried out the scenarios that James listed in his post: 5 dudes versus 5 zombies in 10 minutes, 5 guys versus 25 goblins in 15 minutes.<br/><br/>From that playtest I made some changes and got: <a href="http://www.peccable.com/roleplaying/riskbreaker-0.0.1.pdf" rel="nofollow">Riskbreaker</a>.

Is the only difference between Skill Damage and Killing Damage that Killing damage spans all skills (e.g. if you have Killing Damge of 3, you can no longer use any Skill of 3 or less to stay in combat) and Skill Damage is limited to a single skill (e.g. if you have Killing Damage of 2 and M3:Sword Skill Damage of 1, you can't sty in combat with Sword, but you could switch to M3: Dagger and keep fighting)?<br/><br/><br/>The first thing that occurs to me is that circumstantial Advantage might be represented by tokens, as physical bits are frequently easier to track and visualize than marking and erasing a sheet of paper.<br/><br/>By the same turn, I an imagine an awesome* prop for this would be a scale set on the table to concretely represent the tide of battle turning.  You would pile tokens for each side in on or the other plates and the scale could tell you who was advantaged.  <br/><br/>*Of course, unless calibrated for the weight of the token it couldn't tell you how much a side was advantaged by.<br/>*And only a single battle could be represented at a time.<br/>*Maybe it just seems cool in my head <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>I want to take these ideas and smash them together with SOTC (for Aspects &amp; Zones), Red Box Hack (for Arenas and Awesome tokens from assisting), Geiger Counter (for index cards representing locations and having advantage dice associated with specific locals), and Microlite 20 (for simple D&amp;D fun).

In other words, your ability to stay in battle is based on your base Stat in the skill you're using.  I can do as much Skill Damage to you as I like and not get one step closer to taking you out of battle.  However, you'll probably not be making any of your rolls...<br/><br/>Actually "Skill" Damage is something of a misnomer.  You're actually lowering the associated Stat, which is what you roll against for the Skill.  I guess that didn't come across clearly enough?  <br/><br/>That said, I never thought what happens when you reach a Stat/Skill of 0.  I guess you just automatically fail all your rolls?  Sucks if you're trying to run away and your Agility has been taken out.<br/><br/><br/>Physically representing Advantage sounds cool - though the actual scale thing sounds (as you noted) a little too complicated. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I was actually thinking of something like strips of paper numbered from -10 to +10 and you just move a marker up and down the scale as necessary.<br/><br/><br/>By all means, smash away.  Shoving a bunch of ideas from the games I talked about in my first post is what resulted in this ruleset in the first place. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>-d-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139802/#Comment_139802" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-15T12:57:09+00:00" title="April 15, 2008 12:57PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The chance to turn a mechanical bonus into a damage advantage definitely has me thinking.

Hopefully something useful is in there:<br/>\n<br/>\nCheck out this: http://www.geocities.com/zozergames/zenobia.html<br/>\nHas some similarites (and had more, I think, in previous versions). Paul beat most of us to simultaneous combat. <br/>\n<br/>\n----<br/>\nReading the text, some of the instructions seem to carry meaning that is implied, referring to procedures that you know, but aren't relaying. Like:<br/>\n<br/>\n"This system assumes everyone is fighting all the time and abstracts that, basically ignoring it with only a few mechanical effects."<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you ignore something with mechanical effects? Are you just saying that it's not blow-by-blow? If that's the case, give positive description, not negative. That is, say what it does, not what it doesn't. Something like:<br/>\n<br/>\n"Each roll involves potentially a lot of fighting, and gives us information as to when the battle changes."<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, stating it like that says why I like systems like this... no whiff factor. You roll, and you either are in a better position than you were, or a worse one. No rolls where we end up right where we were before the roll. But we don't have to tell people that. It'll be obvious to them when they play. <br/>\n<br/>\nHere's another implied procedure:<br/>\n<br/>\n"Every fight has only two sides. If there are more than two sides, break the fight down into smaller fights until there are only two."<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you're saying that if a side has two opponents who are not on the same side (making three sides, total), then your side has to split to take them on? Yes? Not clear. If so, then who gets to determine who they are paired off with? Even if you leave it up to the players, they will fight over who has to deal with what. And maybe it's best if sometimes the other sides decide. So having a method for determining who gets to decide is important. It could even be something like, "The GM gives the players ten seconds to decide who takes on what. If by the end of that, they cannot agree, then the GM gets to assign the sides any way he likes, and will not be nice about it." <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso you could have an effect of ambush be that the side doing the ambushing always gets to decide first. And, by the way, the ambush bonus should be based on a contest between things like Hide, and Sneak and Observation and Distract, etc. Instead of GM fiat. They risk up to 3, and get that much advantage. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt's very important to get this part right, and make it clear. A step-by-step process would be helpful. <br/>\n<br/>\n----<br/>\n"Subsequent rounds' are affected by this skill level difference." You were talking about the advantage differential previous to this. Confusing. I assume you're actually refering to the higher skilled side? Or does the side with the advantage get more advantage? <br/>\n<br/>\n----<br/>\n"Ties on the same side do not matter." Yes, they do. Both players will want to land the killing blow on the orc. Or there may be some tactical consideration that will make it beneficial for one player to go before another. Somebody has to make the decision which is resolved first. It's good to have a method for when it does matter. Again, it doesn't have to be deterministic. But there has to be a final way to determine these things when it is contested. <br/>\n<br/>\n----<br/>\nWhy are ties broken by the side with less advantage? Just an underdog rule? What if both skill and advantage are tied (advantage is zero)? It'll happen. <br/>\n<br/>\n----<br/>\nSpecial Actions and Advantage Actions seem similar (all of your examples sound, to me, like building advantages). But generally, they both allow most any skill to be used. In play, of course, the player will always want to use his highest ability. Is the rule actually that the player may invoke any skill they like in these cases (except for the combat ability in use in the case of an Advantage action)? Or that the situation dictates which abilities are actually useful? If you can use only one ability for "everything else" then why take more than one ever? <br/>\n<br/>\n----<br/>\nWhy not just add two to each stat, to make the roll-under comparison direct (instead of adding stat +2, and rolling under that number)? I don't think that it'll affect the other math. And why not use a D12, with a limit of 11 or something? So that the higher levels are worth something. Basically there's a huge disincentive to taking high levels of ability, it seems, in that they are only valuable in limited circumstances, and not on the die roll (with the cap in place). <br/>\n<br/>\nContinued...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_139919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139919/#Comment_139919" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-16T06:45:07+00:00" title="April 16, 2008  6:45AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...from above. <br/>\n<br/>\n----<br/>\n"Any remaining damage can be assigned to other opponents."<br/>\n<br/>\nOthers opponents on the same side?

They lose that amount of advantage, right? Not damaged? I'm pretty sure this is what you mean, but you aren't explicit.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm sensing that it may be that the downside is always the same. If so, just describe what the upsides give you for each type, and have only one description of losing that applies to all losses. Easier to remember that there's no difference then. <br/>\n<br/>\n----<br/>\nThere needs to be mechanics for skill damage recovery. I'm thinking about the Heal ability. I'm thinking that it's probably pretty simple: pick a risk level, roll against it, and if successful, get back that level of damage. If you fail, the caster takes that level of skill damage, or something, from spell backfire, which cannot be healed by Heal (eventually he'll burn out his ability to heal, and they'll have to rely on long-term healing). <br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact that can be your limit on magic in general... failures don't reduce your advantage, but cause skill damage to that skill (or maybe both!). So eventually they become less and less reliable, and eventually you have to go and do long-term healing. <br/>\n<br/>\n----<br/>\nI'd make the penalties to fighting three rounds one point of skill damage, instead of one point of Kill Damage. This will still limit the fight, but represents exhaustion, etc, and can be recovered with a recovery action. <br/>\n<br/>\n----<br/>\nOverall, I'd say that the only problem I see is that you have to gain advantage to hurt somebody. meaning that fights are many rolls, because it takes two successes in a row to damage the opponent once. It could go back and forth quite a lot. Why not limit Risk to, say, Advantage +2, instead of just to the level of Advantage? So that even if you're at -1 you can risk it, and you can go for damage right off the bat if you like. <br/>\n<br/>\nOtherwise you risk replacing the "whiff-factor" with a "seesaw factor." Another idea is to make Advantage non-zero sum. Maybe each side starts out with 1 Advantage, and it goes up from there. You could also just not cap risk. Meaning that when the advantage gets high, you can resolve quickly. So things don't drag out too long. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat's not quite right there, but you get where I'm going. <br/>\n<br/>\n----<br/>\nI'd look at the zone rules for RBH and TGCHNN and such for movement. That is Zones should give you mechanical advantages that may be leveraged only with certain skills and such. This would be a good way to make it so that other skills would come in useful, rather than allowing any skill to be used to gain advantage at any time. Like "Glass Cases Zone: use Distraction skill to gain advantage by breaking glass cases." Just a thought. <br/>\n<br/>\n----<br/>\nWhat are you thinking for armor? Using the classic trade-off rules, the side with more armor could start off with an advantage, but at the cost of lowering their skill. Like choose a level one through three, and this is how much skill is lost, or relative advantage they have. You could do the same with weapons, actually. The other, more traditional exchange would be skill for bonus damage for weapons, and skill for damage reduction with armor. <br/>\n<br/>\nNot great (I think these probably can be easily min-maxed), but it might be a start in thinking about armor and weapons. I'm personally a realist about these things and usually just give them situational modifiers as appropriate (usually in a fight, the side with the better armor simply has an advantage, hence why you wear armor). But for a competitive game, you don't want to make armor an advantage purely, without some cost, or there's only one winning strategy, to wear it. <br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nThat leads me to another observation, which is that your "everything else" resolution is wishy-washy at this point. Interestingly, your notion that it seems odd that a win at contest A can't roll over to contest B seems short-sighted. That is, why not have most rolls be an attempt before hand to store up damage. From another POV, the entire dungeon is one big combat, the foes just change at times to traps, or contests to find stuff for advantage. Treasure, for instance. If you find a magical sword, you now have an advantage against all foes who do not, right? Finding healing herbs can be an advantage in a contest to do Healing. An invisibility potion is an advantage to an ambush roll, if found. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I'm saying is that if you unify the combat and non-combat procedures into one overall resolution method, then I think everything flows together into one seamless whole. Note that using HQ's extended contest rules, I have, in fact, resolved entire dungeon delves as one contest. Your method would be even better for this, because it allows for longer-term back and forth. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139987/#Comment_139987" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-16T09:42:50+00:00" title="April 16, 2008  9:42AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My current thinking on this general problem (it's not your system, Daniel, but rather trying to think about this problem) - is to think of it in terms of grand maneuvers.<br/><br/>So, in our last game, the players took out an entire lair of Goblins.  Their tactics looked like this:<br/><br/>Draw Out Enemy + Bottleneck + Barricade &amp; Melee Line + Archery Bombardment.  They used some flaming oil to turn the Bottleneck maneuver into a damaging set-up.<br/><br/>The Goblins had their own tactics for dealing with intruders:<br/>Protect the King + Cut off Escape + Charge (x2) + Archery Bombardment + Distractions.  As you can see, this is a pretty defensive set-up, designed to box someone in, and then pelt them to death and stab them with spears once they're trapped. <br/><br/>So when the players implemented their own tactics - which was essentially to create a defensive line, and lure the enemy into assaulting it - the Goblins didn't have a whole lot that would overcome that.  Their two Charging units were completely wiped out in the flaming Bottleneck.  The heroes had built their line outside the perimeter of the "Cut off Escape" unit, so those goblins were pretty useless.  Once the fighting died down, the players tricked the remaining Goblins to come in as back-up and loot the "human corpses" - so the remaining goblins walked into another flaming-oil ambush.  The king's guards made one last Suicide Charge to try to break through the barricade, but it didn't work.<br/><br/>This was the fun part: devising this stuff and watching it play out.  I just wish we didn't have to watch it play out one sword-stroke or sling-bullet at a time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_140025">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140025/#Comment_140025" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-16T11:13:25+00:00" title="April 16, 2008 11:13AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that Daniel's game has this close to covered, James, no? That is, each of the parts you mention like setting up the distractions and bombardments would be maneuvers made to gain advantage. Then comes the damaging roll to take out some of the gobbos. And their rolls then to try to regain the advantage by charging the barricade, for instance, their failure, and finishing them off. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour entire example could maybe be done in just a few rounds of rolls with Daniel's system. Assuming that he just kinda allows that to happen. Right now it seems to point a tad more incremental than this, but I think that's easily fixed by removing some of the caps that slow you down. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing that would help to make this work is if each team member worked to give advantage to their "Side" and that side then was resolved as a whole against the whole other side. Just a thought. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I agree with your thrust, James, that this is a pretty good goal. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_140036">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140036/#Comment_140036" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-16T11:54:04+00:00" title="April 16, 2008 11:54AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (I haven't had a chance to review Daniel's doc in depth.

I really appreciate it.<br/><br/>Mike: I'll try taking your comments one at a time.  There's a lot of really great stuff here.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Reading the text, some of the instructions seem to carry meaning that is implied, referring to procedures that you know, but aren't relaying.</blockquote>\nAbsolutely dead on.  It's very much a first draft, unfortunately, and I'm sure there's stuff that's not coming through clearly enough, which will hopefully be fixed in future drafts.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Are you just saying that it's not blow-by-blow? If that's the case, give positive description, not negative. That is, say what it does, not what it doesn't. Something like:<br/>"Each roll involves potentially a lot of fighting, and gives us information as to when the battle changes."</blockquote>\nThe original sentence isn't clear at all.  Yes, what I was basically trying to say is that the system isn't blow-by-blow, and that characters are taking damage while things are going on (represented by the combat counter).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>In fact, stating it like that says why I like systems like this... no whiff factor. You roll, and you either are in a better position than you were, or a worse one. No rolls where we end up right where we were before the roll. But we don't have to tell people that. It'll be obvious to them when they play.</blockquote>\nThe whiff factor was very much what I was trying to avoid.  Though, shouldn't I be making the intentions of the system up front?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Here's another implied procedure:<br/>"Every fight has only two sides. If there are more than two sides, break the fight down into smaller fights until there are only two."<br/><br/>I think you're saying that if a side has two opponents who are not on the same side (making three sides, total), then your side has to split to take them on? Yes? Not clear. If so, then who gets to determine who they are paired off with? Even if you leave it up to the players, they will fight over who has to deal with what.</blockquote>\nI was trying to keep things as simple as possible, but one <b>could</b> set up multiple fights with advantages amongst groups (i.e. three groups fighting in a melee produce 3 'fights': Group A veruss Group B, Group B versus Group C, Group C versus Group A).  The problem I had with that is that you're splitting your forces, so how do you handle things like the outnumbering factor (what side do you get the bonus against?).  I agree that having an established system would be better than leaving it up to the players, but I'm not sure how.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Also you could have an effect of ambush be that the side doing the ambushing always gets to decide first.</blockquote>\nI like this very much. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>And, by the way, the ambush bonus should be based on a contest between things like Hide, and Sneak and Observation and Distract, etc. Instead of GM fiat. They risk up to 3, and get that much advantage.</blockquote>\nAnd I like this even more!  Consider it added to the rules. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>It's very important to get this part right, and make it clear. A step-by-step process would be helpful.</blockquote>\nAgreed, it's just that I'm unclear how I'd do some of the specifics (see above).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_140183">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/peccable" title="peccable"><img alt="peccable" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/peccable">peccable</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140183/#Comment_140183" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-17T07:31:06+00:00" title="April 17, 2008  7:31AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 17, 2008 7:52AM by peccable.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>"Subsequent rounds' are affected by this skill level difference." You were talking about the advantage differential previous to this. Confusing. I assume you're actually refering to the higher skilled side? Or does the side with the advantage get more advantage?</blockquote>\nYeah, this isn't clear at all.  What I meant was:<br/><br/>"Advantage increases by the <b>current</b> difference in skill level between the two sides each subsequent round."<br/><br/>Here's an example:<br/><br/>Your group has ambushed mine, and the first round shakes out such that even though we start out equally balanced (15 versus 15), you manage to do some skill damage to my side such that I'm down 3 points (15 versus 12).<br/><br/>At the end of the first round, though, between what you've spent on the attacks and some Advantage Actions I've taken, I'm at +3 Advantage on my side.<br/><br/>As we start the next round, we see that your skill level is 3 higher than mine, pulling the Advantage back to 0 as we begin.<br/><br/>In other words, skill differences produce Advantage at the beginning of every turn.  It's basically a continuation of the first round, where we started from zero, plus the difference in skill level.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>"Ties on the same side do not matter." Yes, they do. Both players will want to land the killing blow on the orc. Or there may be some tactical consideration that will make it beneficial for one player to go before another. Somebody has to make the decision which is resolved first.</blockquote>\nHow about: "Characters on the same side can go in any order they like.  If there is a conflict, the character with the higher effective Agility goes first.  In the case of a tie, roll."\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Why are ties broken by the side with less advantage? Just an underdog rule?</blockquote>\nYeah, it's an underdog rule.  The way I saw it is that if you come into a round with a massive amount of Advantage against you, you're in for some hurting.  I thought it would be interesting to give the underdog the chance to either pull off crazy Advantage moves to try saving themselves, or just run the hell away.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Special Actions and Advantage Actions seem similar (all of your examples sound, to me, like building advantages). But generally, they both allow most any skill to be used. In play, of course, the player will always want to use his highest ability. Is the rule actually that the player may invoke any skill they like in these cases (except for the combat ability in use in the case of an Advantage action)? Or that the situation dictates which abilities are actually useful? If you can use only one ability for "everything else" then why take more than one ever?</blockquote>\nOK, now I think this is the first of your comments that I disagree with.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Special Actions are:<br/>\t* Maneuver: Escape/move between fights.<br/>\t* Alteration: Delay/prevent movement<br/>\t* Tactics: Move/Re-allocate forces<br/>\t* Recovery: Recover Skill Damage<br/><br/>None of them gain you Advantage.  You can <b>lose</b> Advantage (if you fail) or mess up your forces in various ways, but none of them are actual "I'm trying to gain Advantage" moves.<br/><br/>Also, I'm sorry if this is unclear, but my intention absolutely was that the situation dictates what skill you use.  The "you can use any skill" meant that you can use any skill you have that's appropriate, to separate it from Damage Attacks, which only allow you to use your current fighting skill.<br/><br/><b>That</b> said, however, I think I'm going to change this in any case.  I'll explain when I get to your comment about Risk caps.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Why not just add two to each stat, to make the roll-under comparison direct (instead of adding stat +2, and rolling under that number)? I don't think that it'll affect the other math. And why not use a D12, with a limit of 11 or something? So that the higher levels are worth something. Basically there's a huge disincentive to taking high levels of ability, it seems, in that they are only valuable in limited circumstances, and not on the die roll (with the cap in place).</blockquote>\nThe math in the system is very much in flux at the moment.  The original system worked for me because I wanted mooks to have a fight rating of 1 and a 20% chance of success (since that sounded right in my head).  The cap at 90% on the higher end was (1) just how it worked out and (2) interesting to me in that you're not getting better at your maneuvers, but you can take more Skill and Kill Damage before being messed up or knocked out of the fight, along with producing Advantage every turn, all of which seem worth it to me.<br/><br/>I'll definitely think about reworking it though, as it gets tested.<br/><br/>Whew!  That's the first post.  I'll try getting to the second later.<br/><br/>Thanks again!<br/><br/>-d-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_140197">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140197/#Comment_140197" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-17T08:40:07+00:00" title="April 17, 2008  8:40AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, lots to work on...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout "intentions." Nowhere in Monopoly does it say, "We have an auction mechanic, because that represents real world market forces at work." <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not against design notes. But I really don't like them to be interspersed with the rules. This is a personal thing, obviously Vincent feels otherwise, for example, and he's right sometimes. Sometimes the intent is important to state because there's a judgment to be made, and the intent gives clarifications on how to make those judgments, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut where it's just a procedure, just write the procedure, IMO. Then, later, if you want to have a chapter in which you discuss your design methodology and rationales, go for it. Just don't make me have to read through that in order to figure out how to play. I am going to assume that your system is playtested and works as designed, and alter it only when I find a problem. So you don't have to justify it at all to me or anyone else. <br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, explain what it is, simply, and not what it ain't. The worse problem with text like this is that the subtext reads like, "Dudez, this is sooo much better than those other systems that do blow-by-blow" which sounds self-conscious. Just don't do that. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe games that inspire this one always have a "surprise" die roll. Note that in games that consider themselves even more tactically aligned, these are often called "encounter" die rolls. But the point of them is to determine things like the range at which the opponent is detected and such. I'd suggest using such a system here. Mix it in with ambush. Ambush is just the result of getting a high result on the encounter roll, more likely to happen if the side has intelligence on you (an advantage from an earlier conflict, no doubt). Basically whichever side wins this contest, they get to decide on who is attacking who..<br/>\n<br/>\nHeh, you can have a tank who pulls agro... sorry, WoW moment there...<br/>\n<br/>\nDare I say it, but the side that wins the contest gains an advantage called "initiative?" <br/>\n<br/>\nNote that this involves either having each opponent roll against all the others, or everybody rolls individually, or... perhaps you want to have some "team" rule. Where you use a representative character for his whole team. This could be the one that they select, or, in a case like ambushing, if they're all involved, it could be the least skillful. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYour clarification of the procedure each round to adjust the advantage by skill is very important. Sometimes less is more. Don't say that you do this phase again next round... just say what you do in a round, and it should be clear that this is the procedure every round. <br/>\n<br/>\nUnderstanding this ameliorates some of my concern about length of fights, in that one side will constantly be getting the advantage back automatically, if their skill is not attacked. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYour rule to resolve ties is the standard one. Not bad. If you wanted to get more tricksy, however, you could allow players to sacrifice some of their skill to bid up their agility to go earlier. Trading off going first for effectiveness. Another risk they can choose to take, for whatever reward that they feel it might be worth. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nContinued...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_140198">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140198/#Comment_140198" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-17T08:40:22+00:00" title="April 17, 2008  8:40AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 17, 2008 8:44AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...from above. <br/>\n<br/>\n"Appropriate" for determining which abilities can be used in a particular situation is determined by... the GM? This is why I was arguing for zone definitions that include when you can use what ability. Because GM arbitrary calls here are problematic. Because player behavior is driven to whining about plausibility until the GM gives in. If it's hard-coded somehow, and not a judgment, then the GM is off the hook, and doesn't have to face this. It's also then part of building an interesting challenge. Players can have to roll to determine if a particular zone holds some hidden potential with some skill.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I get what you're saying with "special" stuff. Some of it I'd still define by advantage mechanically, however. To go back a step, I think that all of these options have to have hard mechanical results. So... let's say I delay you somehow... what mechanical effect does that have in play? Sounds like an advantage in certain situations. Or how about it means that you make the opponent lose a turn? <br/>\n<br/>\nThat's actually a quite optimal option if you allow it, under certain circumstances. If you double-team an opponent, then one hurts him, while the other takes away his action. But it's a possibility for this sort of thing. <br/>\n<br/>\nBasically I'd split "Special" actions into their actual action categories, and describe each and every one of them with mechanical precision. What I'm advocating is an "effects first" system. You're already half-way there. Allow the player to define the action in in-game terms in any way that fits the mechanical outcome. So... if a player is "delaying" a character using the "alteration" action, so as to make him easier to hit and hurt, this is an advantage action. If he's "delaying" a character so as to make him lose a turn, then use the rules for that (if you put such in). <br/>\n<br/>\nI like your definitions for "maneuver" above. A player making a successful maneuver action can choose to either disengage from fighting altogether, or select new opponents. Don't group this in "special" actions, make it it's own category. In that category, explain how greater risk has greater rewards. <br/>\n<br/>\nTactics: if these are not done to create advantage... then what mechanical effect do they have? Your description makes them sound precisely like maneuvers. The example is, in fact, one of taking away enemy advantage, which is the same as gaining advantage. If you allow there to be a special "funneling" rule, then that's going to be superior to using "Advantage" in some cases, and disadvantageous in others. So there's no real choice. So just make it advantage. That way, too, the roll will determine how succcessful the funneling is, rather than have it be all or nothing based on the numbers of opponents. <br/>\n<br/>\nRecovery: OK, cool, this one is mechanically defined. It's not clear from what you have written, but I'm assuming that the rule is that you have to have performed a successful "maneuver selecting no opponents" the action before? Meaning that if you're being chased, that you have to succeed, and they have to fail on their turn, right? That's cool. <br/>\n<br/>\nReading the rules again, maybe you do have a long-term healing magic rule... it works the same as skill damage healing? Only you need to have the skill in question, and the damage reduced is from Kill Damage, not skill? <br/>\n<br/>\nBasically I'm seeing the following mechanical effects identified:<br/>\n - The ones you had<br/>\n - - Gain Advantage<br/>\n - - Cause Skill Damage<br/>\n - - Cause Kill Damage<br/>\n - Others<br/>\n - - Change Opponents/Disengage/Engage<br/>\n - - Recover (only if currently Disengaged)<br/>\n - - Delay Opponent (take his action away)<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd go with those six, until you can identify some other specific ones. Instead of kludging several into "Special" actions. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you definitely need a "toughness" skill. So you can make giants who are low skill, yet hard to kill (which you seem to be asking for). Something like: Toughness can be used to make a free roll to recover kill damage once during a fight. Representing wounds that appeared to be bad, but are turning out not to be as bad as they first appeared. Armor could modify this, or actually BE the source of toughness. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_140199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140199/#Comment_140199" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-17T08:46:49+00:00" title="April 17, 2008  8:46AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and following these two posts above, one general note:<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you have some of this all nailed down, we get to tackle the big Game Theory problem... ensuring that the game is tactically rich.

Others opponents on the same side? Or anybody?</blockquote>\nAgain, first draft unclearness. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  Opponents on the same side in the same fight that make sense situation-wise.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>"If a character fails a Kill Damage Action, not only is his opponent not damaged, but his side immediately loses twice the amount of established Risk!" They lose that amount of advantage, right? Not damaged? I'm pretty sure this is what you mean, but you aren't explicit.</blockquote>\nAck, that's an awful mistake there.  Yes, his opponent is not damaged and his side's loses ADVANTAGE equal to twice the established Risk.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>I'm sensing that it may be that the downside is always the same. If so, just describe what the upsides give you for each type, and have only one description of losing that applies to all losses. Easier to remember that there's no difference then.</blockquote>\nThere are generalities within types.  Advantage actions have the downside of losing your established Risk if you fail.  Damage actions have the downside of losing either your established Risk (if you succeed) or twice your established Risk (if you fail).  Special actions have you either losing or being damaged/delayed/disadvantaged by your established Risk if you fail (particularly if I include that 'Spell Failure = Skill Damage' idea you came up with).<br/><br/>I think that's what I tried doing when I wrote that section, as actions are grouped together as above.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>In fact that can be your limit on magic in general... failures don't reduce your advantage, but cause skill damage to that skill (or maybe both!). So eventually they become less and less reliable, and eventually you have to go and do long-term healing.</blockquote>\nThis is a very cool idea!  There's also the possibility of you take points of damage and can choose where they go: Advantage loss or Skill Damage.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>I'd make the penalties to fighting three rounds one point of skill damage, instead of one point of Kill Damage. This will still limit the fight, but represents exhaustion, etc, and can be recovered with a recovery action.</blockquote>\nI still like the idea that mooks can only stay actively fighting (without some sort of healing/medicine) for three rounds, though.  It speeds things up.  I'm not sure which direction to go on this one.  The 'exhaustion' makes more sense, but the idea of the abstraction is that people are fighting and getting hit the whole time this is going on.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Overall, I'd say that the only problem I see is that you have to gain advantage to hurt somebody. meaning that fights are many rolls, because it takes two successes in a row to damage the opponent once. It could go back and forth quite a lot. Why not limit Risk to, say, Advantage +2, instead of just to the level of Advantage? So that even if you're at -1 you can risk it, and you can go for damage right off the bat if you like.</blockquote>\nPure skill, outnumbering your opponents, or ambushing them will all give you Advantage, though, the first two without any sort of roll at all.  The +2 rule would be interesting, but it makes things a little more complicated.  I liked the purity of just 'spending' Advantage as damage.  You don't have it, you can't spend it.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>You could also just not cap risk. Meaning that when the advantage gets high, you can resolve quickly. So things don't drag out too long. </blockquote>\nNow this I like a lot.  Here's my thinking:<br/><br/>1. If you're playing one guy swinging his sword or firing his bow, you're capped at 1-3 Risk, max.<br/>2. If you're playing a group, like you leading a calvary charge, you get a cap of (3 x number of guys).  You and your five hirelings could do a max of 18 (3x6) skill/kill damage.  Would the same thing apply to Advantage action caps?  This makes hirelings interesting in that their skills are boosts to your Advantage (via their skill level and the possibility of outnumbering your foes), as well as your Risk cap, but the rolls are still all you.<br/>3. If you're doing something that has an Area of Effect (AoE attacks!), like pushing over a vat of boiling oil or casting a Fireball spell (making magic more interesting than just color!) there's no cap on Risk.  You can spend up to your max positive Advantage. (That last one is particularly interesting if the 'you take Skill Damage if your spell fails' rule is in place).<br/><br/>This way makes sense to me, since without a cap on individuals, it get kind of crazy ("My 1 fighter takes out 30 goblins in 1 turn!").                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_140227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/peccable" title="peccable"><img alt="peccable" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/peccable">peccable</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140227/#Comment_140227" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-17T11:24:39+00:00" title="April 17, 2008 11:24AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (continued)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>I'd look at the zone rules for RBH and TGCHNN and such for movement. That is Zones should give you mechanical advantages that may be leveraged only with certain skills and such. This would be a good way to make it so that other skills would come in useful, rather than allowing any skill to be used to gain advantage at any time. Like "Glass Cases Zone: use Distraction skill to gain advantage by breaking glass cases." Just a thought.</blockquote>\nIt's an interesting idea, but I don't know if I'd want to quantify this so specifically.  As a GM, if I've described the battle as being in an area of a museum full of glass cases and the player said he was going to start smashing them to distract the enemy, I'd let him, but I don't know if I'd want it spelled out to that level.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>What are you thinking for armor?</blockquote>\nI honestly wasn't planning on implementing rules for it, just as there aren't rules for specific weapons (a sword is mechanically the same as a spear or a bow).  The stat you're fighting with was supposed to represent all of that.  I suppose you could implement it as a specific increase in a stat towards a specific use: magical weapons give you +Muscle or +Agility when using your Fight skill, magical armor would give you a higher Fight stat, but only with regards to the amount of Kill or Skill Damage you can take?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>That leads me to another observation, which is that your "everything else" resolution is wishy-washy at this point. Interestingly, your notion that it seems odd that a win at contest A can't roll over to contest B seems short-sighted. That is, why not have most rolls be an attempt before hand to store up damage. From another POV, the entire dungeon is one big combat, the foes just change at times to traps, or contests to find stuff for advantage.</blockquote>\nHuh.<br/><br/>So a dungeon becomes a "Party vs. Dungeon" fight, with advantage on each side?<br/><br/>There's something very much like Descent boardgame in this: if the 'Dungeon' (GM) can pool up advantage from the party messing up (setting off traps, alarms, etc), then he can convert that into 'damage' like 'creating' monsters from the advantage points and the like.  You could even have a Donjon-like element in characters converting their Advantage into finding treasure.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Treasure, for instance. If you find a magical sword, you now have an advantage against all foes who do not, right? Finding healing herbs can be an advantage in a contest to do Healing. An invisibility potion is an advantage to an ambush roll, if found.</blockquote>\nI'd handle the sword as I noted above, healing herbs would be a temporary +Wit on a Healing spell or Medicine roll, and yeah, the invisibility potion would just be +Advantage in that situation.<br/><br/>All in all, some very neat ideas.  I've got a lot to think about.<br/><br/>Also: I just saw your new post.

Post at whatever pace you like. But I hope you don't mind me giving feedback as fast as it comes to me. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow...<br/>\n<br/>\nFor listing actions, have a standard template like:<br/>\nAbility Used:<br/>\nWin:<br/>\nLose:<br/>\n<br/>\nIndicating what happens in each case, and showing how the action plugs into regular resolution. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFor magic you have a great idea there in the caster being able to select where the damge goes. How about he can also select Kill Damage, if he so wishes. Representing actual backlash against his form, or even just expending bodily resources in the attempt. It might not get used a lot, but then again it might. In any case it would be interesting if/when it happens. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the exhaustion idea, if you go with a strict roll equal to or under, then you can rate mooks as a 1 for skill, and if they lose that one skill after three rounds, then they go to a zero skill, and no chance to succeed. Accomplishes your goal of elimination, without neccessarily having them take kill damage. You can narrate them surrendering to the vastly more powerful PCs, and the like. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, I assume that "skill damage" as "exhaustion" actually does include small injuries and the like. Not enough to really threaten your life, but certainly enough to make you less effective. Perhaps instead of "exhaustion" you can say that they're "worn down" or something more evocative. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree that the "Advantage +2" rule I proposed is inelegant. Again it might work better to simply have it where Advantage is rated as two higher all the time. Again, making it non-zero sum would do this. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour ideas for Risk cap are exactly what I was hoping you'd come up with. That said, you're starting to privilege magic a lot. They get to distribute their failures between three pools instead of one, and have no risk cap. That gives it more options than other abilities. You might need something to balance this. <br/>\n<br/>\nTruth be told, I have no problem with a warrior taking out thirty goblins in one abstract roll. How's that any different from doing thirty abstract rolls? I mean, he'd have to build up some massive advantage first... so if he manages to crush them all under a boulder that he's taken several turns to loosen up and get it so that the gobbos are under it, why not let him crush them all? Or even just do a whirlwind of death? I mean a "turn" has no set length, does it? It's "as long as it takes a character to get to a roll" no? <br/>\n<br/>\nI mean you can play out armies with these rules, and have the turns be an hours worth of battlefield maneuvers, for instance. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don't want to have to pre-define zones or something, then maybe you can have a randomization system or the like. Again, with a tactical game like this, do whatever you can to avoid the problem where you're forgetting to give one player an opportunity to use the abilities he spent on, while another player uses the same ability over and over and over. Again, it leads to either hard feelings, or players always whining to get an ability OKed for use. <br/>\n<br/>\nArmor increasing the fight stat is very with the system you have, but it's easier just to say that it absorbs the first hit of Kill Damage. Same effect, right? <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm tempted to ask for a second level of roll for damage that converts the kill damage in a contest between weapon strength and armor/toughness. Yeah, a Soak Roll, basically. But that's probably not what you're looking for... <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWith regards to your example of how it would be like Decent and Donjon, yes, exactly like that is what I'm thinking. Do search rolls in a room to find treasure, the cap on the level gained being equal to the fight ability of the monsters in the room... that sort of thing. If the dungeon wins a roll to slow you down in the early going, it means that the denizens are no more awake and altert or something, and this is what it's advantage represents. That sort of thing. <br/>\n<br/>\nEach "encounter" in the dungeon, be it with monsters or traps, or other challenges, all just modify the running total. Note how players will have to burn any advantage they have to win fights, meaning that they can never get way out ahead, and have to "re-advantage" after each fight if they want an advantage going into the next. So this leads to lots of player tactics sneaking around and trying to figure out what's going on and such. Making the "Scout" character indispensible. Or the wizard with "Magic Eye" spell. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_140262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140262/#Comment_140262" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-17T15:54:25+00:00" title="April 17, 2008  3:54PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool stuff!<br/><br/>I have a question:<br/><br/>Why did you choose to make Advantage something that only one side can have (you get some first, then you lose some, now I get some, and we can keep going back and forth without getting anywhere)?<br/><br/>How about Advantage is something that both sides can accumulate, regardless of how much the other side has?

Combat is a zero-sum game, right? Well, only really in terms of the win conditions: somebody gets what they came for, the other goes home in a body bag. The actual back and forth can be, I'd argue, non-zero sum. Often a tactic may advantage your opponent, but you use it anyway, because it gives you even more advantage. In fact you could have an "All-out" sort of rule where the player can take garunteed levels of advantage by giving the opponent the same amount. This is akin to large bids in HQ's extended resolution system, but has better results in yours, I think. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis gives rise to realistic desperation tactics, going all out when you're the underdog, and hoping to get a lucky roll. This is a great effect. It means that, instead of most games where players get more and more tentative when they start go get behind, players have incentive to ramp up the heroics when they get behind. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, the "realist" in mean wants to allow for advantage to be reduced due to circumstance... it seems wrong that advantage always goes up. But it's certainly dramatic to do it this way, and it solves the problem of the never-ending combat neatly. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_140346">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/peccable" title="peccable"><img alt="peccable" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/peccable">peccable</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140346/#Comment_140346" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-18T11:28:01+00:00" title="April 18, 2008 11:28AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll talk about the zero-sum question now.  I've got notes responding to some of the other comments I've gotten, but don't have them together now.<br/><br/>The 'Advantage set around zero, positive for your side means negative for the other' concept was basically the first one I had, so you've got to understand that I'm definitely reluctant to let it go.  The basic idea is that you can't press your advantage (cause damage) until you have advantage to press.  If you can keep your opponent off balance, he's not going to be able to get at you with any sort of effectiveness.<br/><br/>Removing this and having positive points on both sides, to my mind, causes several problems.  The most obvious is that the system becomes a race to boosting up huge amounts of Advantage and just hitting, hitting, hitting.  Which doesn't sound interesting at all.<br/><br/>It just seems that there would be no real back and forth - no ebb and flow to the battle.  In the original system going for a big hit (a high Risk damage action) meant that, if you failed, the Advantage could swing wildly towards your opponent (2x your Risk in Advantage loss) and then you'd be in a bad way until you could get some equilibrium.  The flip side of that is a turn that starts with your opponent with a huge Advantage over you -- I feel like the existing "underdog" rule already encourages desperate moves to whittle that down.  Double or nothing.<br/><br/>The zero-sum allows a form of defense.  Some of my party can just work at keeping you off-balance enough such that we don't get slammed by you.  That doesn't seem possible in a points-on-both-side system.  It seems to me that would kill the whole idea of Risk/Reward, which is kind of the whole point.<br/><br/>Is the obvious answer that this 'keep you off balance' mechanic an action that allows you to subtract from your opponent's Advantage rather than add to your own?  If that's it, I have to say that my Action list just seems to be getting longer and longer, to the point where the whole simple, abstracted idea feels like it's going out the window. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I've now got two votes for 'positive Advantage on both sides'.

You want the effect where the disadvantaged party can't really act, because they're sitting back on their heels.<br/><br/>As you mention, that's achievable in other ways. Perhaps once you've got some Advantage, you can gamble it away to reduce the other side's Advantage? Or, perhaps gaining Advantage gets harder and harder as your Advantage grows, meaning you have to change tactics eventually.<br/><br/>Or, simply: Only the side with the highest Advantage can make a Strike (try to take the other party out altogether). Now consider what a conflict looks like if a) increasing your Advantage gets harder as it increases, and b) only the party with the highest Advantage can try to take the other party out.<br/><br/>I disagree with you about the Risk/Reward angle, though. In your system, even though it's zero-sum, you always Risk losing Advantage to increase you own, or Risk increasing the enemy's when you try to decrease it. It's the same effect exactly, as you would have in a "both sides positive" situation, except we change when you add a number to one side as opposed to subtracting it from the other. The Risk element remains the same under both versions.<br/><br/>Look at how gaining Awesome Tokens works in RBH. It's definitely Risk/Reward, even though both sides can accumulate the Tokens.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_140364">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/peccable" title="peccable"><img alt="peccable" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/peccable">peccable</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140364/#Comment_140364" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-18T12:05:44+00:00" title="April 18, 2008 12:05PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 18, 2008 12:06PM by peccable.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's Dan, actually. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br/><br/>The "sitting back on their heels" sounds really icky, I've got to say.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  Is that how it comes off?  The more I think about this, the more I think that maybe my Simulationist roots are really showing, with me clinging to how things "would really be" as opposed to what would be interesting/fun from a Gamist perspective.<br/><br/>So how about something like this:<br/><br/>* Advantage is a positive value on both sides.<br/>* Initial advantage is calculated using the initiative type stuff we've talked about (rolls for ambushes, etc).<br/>* One side's advantage goes up every turn based on the skill difference (or no one's if there is no skill difference), including the first turn (this generalizes the 'start Advantage at skill difference, then change it by that every other turn' set of rules).<br/>* Actions that would cause you to lose Advantage (on a failure) in the original system now add to the Advantage of the other side.<br/>* Converting Advantage to Damage (taking a Damage action) still lowers your own Advantage by the amount you're spending.  This differentiates 'cost' of damage actions from 'consequences' of failure in an interesting way.<br/>* There are actions (Distraction, for example?) that lower the Advantage of the other side.  This could actually be what the Tactic skill is for -- the 'funnelling' is represented by lowering the other side's Advantage?  This could be generalized as a type of Advantage action, I guess.<br/><br/>Note that there's no longer 'negative' Advantage in this system, which means that both sides can attempt Damage actions if they have any Advantage at all.<br/><br/>Another interesting side-effect is that it generalizes consequence: your opponent's side's Advantage goes up by what you Risked.  The (2x) rule is covered by the 'cost' for Damage action attempts.<br/><br/>(As a side-note, I'm thinking of generalizing the 'consequence' rule mentioned earlier in the thread for magic-users: you can take Skill Damage, Kill Damage, lower Advantage or some combination of all three, as the general consequence rule.  You can narrate your failure as exhausting you (Skill Damage), hurting you (Kill Damage) or helping your enemy (Advantage)).<br/><br/>I'm trying to think if something like this would lose any of the advantages I see in the original system...<br/><br/>Thoughts?<br/><br/>-d-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_140390">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140390/#Comment_140390" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-18T14:30:02+00:00" title="April 18, 2008  2:30PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Daniel,<br/><br/>Sorry to get your name wrong! I was typing too fast, clearly.<br/><br/>I like the "new" version, personally. Just for the record, I think the whole "only one side has advantage and can act freely" can work just fine, if it's the effect you want. It might or might not be less fun, depending on how you set it up.<br/><br/>One question: if every roll is going adjust the Advantage of one side or the other, why do you need a rule for it to increase round by round? It sounds like it's going to be increasing plenty just on its own.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_140674">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140674/#Comment_140674" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-21T11:13:24+00:00" title="April 21, 2008 11:13AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not bad. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem I have, however, is not with negative advantage or anything, but with the fact that it means that when you're negative, your only choice is to do something to get the advantage back. You can't attack, even at a disadvantage. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'd allow stuff to lower advantage, so as to not have it escallate out of control too fast, just biasing it to the upside.
