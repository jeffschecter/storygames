My players and I are all going to get together and  run through character creation, as I explain the setting and rules to them. However, I have a few concerns...<br/>\n<br/>\nGiven that there is <i>so much</i> setting in there, what do you think the best way is to present this to players? How much information should I frontload them with? This seems like the sort of game that would run better with <i>very</i> informed players.<br/>\n<br/>\nI sent them the link to the preview section of the book, and I was thinking about making a cheat sheet with ven terms, laws, and customs on it. Are there any good resources like these online already?<br/>\n<br/>\nI was also thinking about introducing the different parts of the game in a modular way, similar to what I used to do with Burning Wheel. My idea was to have them make their characters tomorrow, but wait to do things like Devotions and Season stuff. I figured that, once everyone gets the core mechanics under their belts, and a feel for the setting, we can slowly inject more and more of the system each session.  It seems like this would work pretty well for HotB.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you all think? Any other advice or experiences with HotB that I should be aware of?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_232032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232032/#Comment_232032" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-12T13:34:45+00:00" title="September 12, 2009  1:34PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played a short session, with Mr Wick, and he only ran through the setting briefly. I think that works well. You don't need much frontloading. It's basically a sort of pseudo-aristocratic-English setting and people tend to get that instinctively.<br><br>Injecting more of the system each setting seems a fairly good idea.<br><br>Graham                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_232038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232038/#Comment_232038" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-12T15:35:00+00:00" title="September 12, 2009  3:35PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 12, 2009 3:35PM by Josh Roby.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Charlie Gilb</cite>Given that there is <em>so much</em> setting in there, what do you think the best way is to present this to players?

Vast swaths of the "setting" material are basically worked examples of basic principles.  The setting material in the book isn't so much "what is true" but examples of how you can make true things about the setting.  I would make this clear to your players: the book isn't a checklist of things they can get wrong; it's a manual for doing things right their way.<br><br>You could probably run just fine explaining just a handful of principles:<br>1. The ven are good at everything... except restraint.<br>2. Ven society has been back-stabby and power-grabby for centuries... and romantic love was just invented.<br/>3. The most important thing in the world is Style.<br/><br/>Remember, wisdom/cunning/prowess risks allow the players to flesh out the world to a <em>powerful</em> extent.  Follow <em>that</em> lead, rather than canon setting material from the book, and you'll be fine.<br/><br/>I wouldn't start play without creating Domains \u2014 they're powerful context for nobles, and having that in the back of their minds will help them overcome dungeoncrawl adventurer thinking.  Skipping devotions at first may work unless one of your players wants to make that his thing, so you may want to check first.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
