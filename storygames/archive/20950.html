A couple years back, I showed up for a session, and I think five of six players were women, something we all noticed and commented on.<br/><br/>"I'll play a guy," I said, as I tend to play cross gender a lot and as I'd made the assumption that there were probably 2 female PCs.<br/><br/>I think a couple others said the same thing.<br/><br/>"No one has to play a guy," said Walt. "Or everyone can, if you want."<br/><br/>It turned out that each of the character sheets had two sides, one for a female version of the PC and one for a male. They differed only in the name and the picture.<br/><br/>In addition to giving folks choice, Walt was trying to make it very clear that, while the default world of Victoriana is sexist, whether or not a group is keeping that element, one need not and should not make the game sexist.<br/><br/>I've also seen games where the GM lets the players choose gender and name of the PCs. At first I found the second part a pain, because Names Are Hard, and especially at a convention game, I don't want to hold things up while I dither. But, it adds a surprising (to me) amount of buy in.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459903">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459903/#Comment_459903" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-04T20:52:04+00:00" title="February  4, 2017  8:52PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's awesome, Lisa.

I had to scrap some of the character names, and replace them with names that are believably gender-flexible. This leads to some fun play when I use the hack - sometimes you get Lady Blackbird with a female Captain who is in love with her, but a male bodyguard, for example.

I mean, in meatspace, in my immediate social circle I can be protective of people I realize are vulnerable and confront or oust people who I realize are being harmful... But on the Internet, how can I be protective of others, in a way which makes a difference? On the Internet, confronting offenders seems to be ineffective, except maybe at boosting the coward lowlifes' self-esteem ("Look, I'm getting some attention 'cause of bullying people over the Internet! Yay me!") and the only ways I know of to police or sanitize my own social circles amount to isolationism.<br/><br/>Any ideas what kind of concrete help a victim of Internet bullying could get from acquaintances or concerned strangers, and isn't getting?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460028">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460028/#Comment_460028" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-07T15:07:41+00:00" title="February  7, 2017  3:07PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Any ideas what kind of concrete help a victim of Internet bullying could get from acquaintances or concerned strangers, and isn't getting?</blockquote>\nThat's the question of the hour.

The next two aren't (and I would posit that they shouldn't be).<br/><br/>So:<br/><br/>I'm going to hurt you/kill you, is a THREAT. Report it, law enforcement should act on it.<br/><br/>If you attack me or infringe upon my rights in a particular way I will defend myself against you using any force necessary is a WARNING. There's nothing anyone can do about it, nor should they be able to. It's instructive and beneficial to individuals and society as a whole.<br/><br/>I wish someone would hurt or kill you is an OPINION. Also perfectly legal. Rude, perhaps, but there's usually no legal recourse (in most jurisdictions) and there absolutely should never be. In fact, trying to suggest there should is one thing that leads to me and others warning that such things could lead to us having to act in a way most wouldn't like. The only correct type of response to opinions is ignoring them utterly, or voicing your own in return. "Yeah, well, I think no one should do business with you because you say that about people." Perfectly legit response, and one that has proved effective in certain instances.<br/><br/>The only thing wrong with free speech (the second two, not the first) in the US is that it isn't broad enough and lacks sufficient protections to ensure it gets used regularly enough. Those failings have created a generation or two of people incapable of dealing with free speech (specifically as it relates to critique). That's a personal weakness, not a reflection of too few regulations.<br/><br/>BTW, I say this as someone who was mercilessly bullied and physically abused growing up, and continues to suffer some forms of bullying and mental/emotional abuse even today. I just have learned enough to effectively diagnose and deal with the situations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460090">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460090/#Comment_460090" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-09T15:30:15+00:00" title="February  9, 2017  3:30PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 11, 2017 3:05AM by Jeff_B_Slater.">edited February 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            .                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460095">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460095/#Comment_460095" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-09T19:13:44+00:00" title="February  9, 2017  7:13PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote> We fight abuse by... making consequences for those who abuse others </blockquote>\nThing is we're not doing that.

However, it has some fundamental aspects that keep it existing as a category.<br/><br/>For instance, "The Second Amendment exists specifically to empower citizens to mount effective resistance against a tyrannical government. I therefore caution all elected and appointed officials that should they choose to ignore established due process and systemic checks and balances (amounting to disregard for the will of the people) they are risking another armed revolution by people such as myself."<br/><br/>Now when you cut out the flowery language what I just posted is exactly the same as what you just posted. It's telling specific people 'do this and I'll fucking kill you'. The thing is, what I wrote is a close paraphrase to much of the discussion surrounding the very formation of our government and legal systems. As such it's intrinsically permitted. <br/><br/>So the grey comes in determining just how/when/why such language is valid. So far the courts have held that it's a matter of immediacy of action, ability of action, and warranted action to a reasonable threshold.<br/><br/>That means that "I'll assassinate all Executive branch officials if they unnecessarily declare  martial law without Congressional approval" IS legal, while "I'll assassinate you if you ever wear a cotton shirt again" would likely be actionable (at least civilly) since it's likely to happen in the near future, you're able to do it, and the wearing of cotton isn't a reasonable warrant for such an action. While you may well be able to kill the executive branch too, there's no indication that such an action is impending, and if it ever did happen there would be at least some broad support for it as well as historic precedent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460128/#Comment_460128" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-10T21:31:25+00:00" title="February 10, 2017  9:31PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            These are unsettled times.

So hiring diversely? Vague guidelines are fine. Going after designers? You'll have to provide more than innuendo.\n<blockquote>As GM, you have a lot of power to "run the table" in terms of who gets to talk, so use that to make sure everyone gets a voice.</blockquote>\nWhich is why I wish games would provide more tools and advice, if not actual mechanics, to address this.\n<blockquote>I struggle with fear of the issues she's talking about everytime I post on the internets. And I don't speak out enough, so I guess their tactics are working.</blockquote>\nSo do I, but at this point I'm too exhausted to be afraid, and know far too many people kept silent by their so-called <i>'allies'</i> to remain so anymore.\n<blockquote>As a point of correction, the reference to Dwolves was to indicate that someone had said that directly to her, as a slur and a threat. Not a commentary on the comic book.</blockquote>\nIn good faith I will assume you know her personally and have a better basis for that interpretation. However what I saw was her rhetorically suggesting the possibility and using a clip of the comic to indirectly indict the group behind it without explicitly calling them out. And considering how many in this community have been forthright in their condemnation of PAX, I don't think my interpretation was unwarranted.\n<blockquote>The negative response here pretty much underlines her issues. Lack of understanding, another attack layered on the ones she's talking about, etc.</blockquote>\nI call shit out. I make spaces for others. I outreach to women and minorities. I back projects on Kickstarter that are minority lead projects or projects that have great diverse teams. I defend people who need defending. I give love to those who are being hurt. I hold people accountable. I run games with inclusive content. <a href="https://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?570300-Sexual-Harassment" rel="nofollow">I was even addressing sexual harassment on rpg.net before that was the cool thing to do</a>.<br/><br/>But because I use <i>different methods to achieve the same results</i> I've now been accused of not only underlining #BlueStocking's issues and lacking understanding, but actually attacking her, which is what vaguely defining the terms of battle makes possible. And not only are these implications defamatory, <i>they make it harder for me to do those things and protect my friends</i>.\n<blockquote>She's talking in part about people online trying to delegitimize her speech, and here you are... online... anonymously... deligitimizing parts of her speech.</blockquote>\nShe's calling on us to target unnamed individuals in the same way <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23ZakSmith&amp;Mode=like">#ZakSmith</a> targets named individuals. And I'm calling out the parts of her speech I see as potentially <i>harmful</i>, just like I do everywhere else, regardless of race or gender. Should I be treating her differently because she's a woman? Does being 'anonymous' somehow invalidate my point?\n<blockquote>The online environment of hostility is a <i>big</i> part of the equation, and I think those of us who want things to be better need to be diligent about not contributing to that.</blockquote>\nAgreed, which is why I think the whole <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23ToneArgument&amp;Mode=like">#ToneArgument</a> defense is bullshit. Tone <i>matters</i>, and if you can't moderate your speech online, you shouldn't expect people to listen to you.<br/><br/>So that being the case, how can we implement #BlueStocking's more confrontational suggestions <i>without</i> contributing to the hostility?\n<blockquote><blockquote> We fight abuse by... making consequences for those who abuse others </blockquote>\nThing is we're not doing that. At all. Ever.</blockquote>\nYes. We are. With absolute measures, and often holding the wrong people accountable for the wrong reasons in our eagerness.<br/><br/>And which moral authority is defining abuse and deciding the consequences anyway? If it were as simple as 'people making death/rape threats/suggestions' should be banned/fired we'd be set. But it's not, is it? And if anyone can define abuse, then all sentencing requires is an accusation.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%23Bluestocking&amp;Mode=like">#Bluestocking</a> said "there's a threshold where we need to start discussing what makes a person a bad person. And sometimes, when it's pushed far enough, they're just too horrible to say bad. There has to be another word". Yet that discussion did not take place.
