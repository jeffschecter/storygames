Ass-kicking characters that evoke power and sex appeal.  <i>Armored knight poignantly masks his feelings while looking into the distance.</i><br/><br/>Indie games, of course, can't afford such lavish art, but I do find myself wondering what sort of artwork would evoke complex, nuanced characters, the role of relationships in story, etc.<br/><br/>Discuss!

This is just a fancy name for a journal constructed from crap paper i filch from the print shop i work at.  But over the last year or so i've realized i can make this little things look and feel really awesome by just adding a sticker over the outside to make a full cover.<br/><br/>For the game i'm currently working on the art i found by Louis Daguerre is utterly perfect (down to silly details - the game uses a deck of cards and insists there be no one but those who are playing the game, and this picture has only two people...and they're wearing red and black...)<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Daguerre%2C_Louis_-_The_Effect_of_Fog_and_Snow_Seen_through_a_Ruined_Gothic_Colonnade_-_1826.jpg"/><br/><br/>And, while we're on Subtlety - i will mention my most favorite painting of all time, which is a visualization of a poem that speaks to me why i create stories that can't be recalled fully, or retold accurately, or made into any kind of artifact.  Why i'm in love with the ephemeral, so to speak.  Because, to me, there is no moment that is not epic, and there is no story that is not (perhaps secretly) connected to the whole, ongoing, universal story of everything...<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Bruegel%2C_Pieter_de_Oude_-_De_val_van_icarus_-_hi_res.jpg"/><br/><br/>"unsignificantly<br/>off the coast<br/>there was<br/><br/>a splash quite unnoticed<br/>this was<br/>Icarus drowning"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342148/#Comment_342148" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-10T13:06:04+00:00" title="September 10, 2011  1:06PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://efemeros.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/ritarit_kansi.jpeg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="http://efemeros.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/ritarit_kansi.jpeg"/></a>I'll contribute an example from a real-life roleplaying game. My friend Sami Koponen published <a href="http://isabout.wordpress.com/fables-of-camelot/" rel="nofollow">Fables of Camelot</a> in Finnish this summer. He got the cover art from a Finnish indie children's picture book artist. I was rather pleased with the art when I saw it, thinking that it was both stylistically mature (mature naivism to boot, a difficult thing to do well) and nuanced about the topic of knighthood, medieval worldview and the clash of modern values with the medieval milieu in the game. An absolutely excellent example of what you can do in independent publishing, ignoring commercially acceptable art conventions. It's been pretty shocking for me and my artistic sensibilities to hear from many Finnish roleplayers that they find the cover art extremely clumsy and amateurish, and unworthy of a publication when "much better" art would be easily available if you just bothered to look for it. In a convention last weekend I was actually laughed at by several hobbyists when I told them I thought the art excellent, and probably better than anything else used in Finnish rpgs this year. Apparently I just don't understand over good art.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342230">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Upstart" title="Upstart"><img alt="Upstart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/303/n8GYZQSU6A1IL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Upstart">Upstart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342230/#Comment_342230" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-11T09:32:04+00:00" title="September 11, 2011  9:32AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My problem isn't that RPG art tries too hard to look like video game concept art. My problem is that the artists aren't professional enough to pull it off. RPG art budgets are so shoestring and the artists so amateurish that I wish games didn't have interior art at all. <br/><br/>I'm not a big fan of that Fables of Camelot cover, but for a naivist piece it's not horrible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
