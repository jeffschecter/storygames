While it's easy to generate lots of ideas and cool plots, it's hard to get a good, focused ending where major plot threads/issues are focused on and resolved. <br/><br/>I'm looking for brainstorm ideas here. Tell me of a GM-less session that ended in a cool climax - and why it did. Or a game (your own, or somebody else's) that solves the problem. Or a random idea you have that might fix this.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254427">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254427/#Comment_254427" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-02T04:36:59+00:00" title="February  2, 2010  4:36AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Oh.

Last week I played an Archipelago II hack where we were all vaguely aware of the developing arc, and when we'd reached the obvious climax, it got called out. There were other dangling threads we could have resolved but the ending felt right. I think this flies in the face of normal geek tendencies to be completist and wrap up every detail. So in that game I was the Witch and had some evil plans and so forth, but the King destroyed his rival, became a werewolf and planted the seeds for his kingdom's downfall. Seeing how my little threads turned out wasn't nearly as important as that resonant and pivotal moment.<br/><br/>Games with mechanical end points don't have this potential problem.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254435">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254435/#Comment_254435" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-02T05:30:40+00:00" title="February  2, 2010  5:30AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some events are universally recognised as The Climax. For example, if you introduce a prom into a high-school game, you know everything will come to a head there. Similarly, the ritual in a Cthulhu game is the climax. So is exploring the deep cave.<br/><br/>If you introduce a ticking bomb (literally) or a couple who should be together but aren't or a final confrontation or a plot to destroy the city, into any game, you've set yourself up for a climax. This needn't be cheesy. You can have estranged couples outside of romantic comedies and final confrontations that are merely talking.<br/><br/>Sometimes, the climax takes a similar form, but is less dramatic. We played Ribbon Drive on Thursday, driving down the coast of California. For some reason, it was obvious that San Francisco was the climax, perhaps because it's a landmark.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254436">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254436/#Comment_254436" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-02T05:40:34+00:00" title="February  2, 2010  5:40AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Graham, but that means often telling a tried and true story, and the power comes from staying within the boundaries. But what if I want different, without necessarily subverting it?<br/><br/>There's a show here about couples before the wedding, on the preparations. Each week (4 episodes, 25 minutes each) ends with the marriage ceremony. Once, they did something I really liked, when most of the fourth and final episode was post-wedding.<br/><br/>But I think this leads us to some of the answer: What type of story do you wish to tell? If you want to tell the story of how a couple came together, or a romantic comedy story, then the wedding is either the finale, or the starting point. A story where the wedding is the middle-point or 75% in is usually quite different.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254452/#Comment_254452" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-02T07:32:51+00:00" title="February  2, 2010  7:32AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Give the players an end goal to reach - tell them if they don't reach it the bad guy wins - give them a limited amount of time/resources to reach the goal. As their resources run low they will focus in on the goal. At least that's been my experience with Matrix Games.

The final episode of the first series of Mad Men ends with a confrontation: just an office conversation, but it's clearly an ending. Our Ribbon Drive game ended with a couple getting together. The high school prom ending also works if you blow up the prom.<br/><br/>Some things just seem like endings and everybody at the table knows it. Other examples: a mystery coming to light; someone accepting themselves for what they really are; any big and dramatic location.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254774">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frederik%20J.%20Jensen" title="Frederik J.

When the major issues raised in the story are resolved. I.e. keeping track of the major issues that the story revolves about is a good thing. One way of doing that is to make these issues explicit to all the players - and perhaps also to limit the possibilities of throwing in new issues late in the game.<br/><br/>This is exactly what 1001 Night does: During the story, players ask questions to the current story teller by putting down a die on the table and stating the question. Once it has been resolved, the player rolls the die and either takes it herself or gives it to the story teller, depending on the roll. Once the story teller has won 8 dice, no more dice can be put down. The story teller ends the story when there are no more dice on the table - i.e. when all issues that the audience cares about has been resolved (or the story teller introduces an abruption in the meta layer (the courtiers in the palace)).<br/><br/>In most other games, I use small pieces of paper to write down important story elements like characters, places, and items. This reminds everyone what has already been created in the fiction - making reintroduction easier.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
