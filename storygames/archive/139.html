<p>I'm starting work in about 2 weeks at a new place, <a href="http://sconex.com" rel="nofollow">Sconex</a>. It's a social networking site (like MySpace or Friendster) that's targetted exclusively at High School students. This got me thinking: could ads at kind of space be a way to access younger kids?</p>
<p>ADDED: Also, please post other concrete suggestions for getting younger people to pick up on story-games. Wandering into a FLGS is probably unlikely unless someone is already a fan.</p>

                            If you mean the wider young audience I think you need to disassociate from RPGs entirely.  The words role-playing need to not show up at all.  <br/>
<br/>
Teen self identity is built around how they view themselves, which is  a reflection of how their peers view them.  This means activities they will gravitate to are things the collective peer group views as cool shit.  RPGs are not that.  They have too many stereotypes tied to them that make them uncool.<br/>
<br/>
Personally I don't think the game has been written that would be successful at appealing to teenagers.                        </div>

                            Yeah, I figure that ads at that space would be a great way to target younger kids.  Like cigarette and whiskey ads should get high results. <br/>(okay, okay)<br/><br/>Hmmmm. I think the best way is to just target them with ads, game by game, introducing it as a game that a few friends can knock around with in study hall or lunch with minimal setup... and no "PLAYERS HANDBOOKS" and other open geekery needed present to make the game function. Roleplaying incognito. This may go over well, as HS students are often self-conscious and want to avoid cruelty directed at them for geek-like activities.<br/><br/>"What are you guys playing, poker?"<br/>"...er, no, we're playing Battlestar Galactica with PTA"<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            There have been a few people looking at this for sometime now, and the answers are a mixed bag. Before I get into my own thoughts about it, I'd like to just drop some links to things other folks are trying. <br/><br/>Wizards of the Coast is doing a program to push literacy and D&amp;D at a younger audience by doing "Adventures in the Afternoon" a program where librarians start D&amp;D campaigns in local and school libraries. Their page is here: <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/library" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/library</a><br/><br/>Chris said some cool things about this while talking about getting poor and disenfranchised kids into gaming at his blog right here: <a href="http://bankuei.blogspot.com/2006/01/loaded.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://bankuei.blogspot.com/2006/01/loaded.html</a><br/><br/>There are a couple of communities of teachers and educators who have been using RPGs at schools in various ways and for various reasons (Paul Elliott and Colin Chapman being among them), as well as parents playing games with their children. <br/><br/>Paul Elliott's game Totem was designed to be run in a school environment: <a href="http://www.geocities.com/zozergames/totem1.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.geocities.com/zozergames/totem1.html</a><br/><br/>There is also a Yahoo group for teachers who play and use RPGs in the classroom (it is a closed group, but some of you might meet the entrance requirements, so you can check): <a href="http://uk.groups.yahoo.com/group/rpgteacher" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://uk.groups.yahoo.com/group/rpgteacher</a><br/><br/>I also know there were several threads about someone playing Heroquest with his son -- but due to the lack of search I can't find it now. So if anyone has that linked, could you toss it up?                        </div>

<p>I actually agree entirely, so there's some putting a cart before the horse here. To even bother marketing a game at high school kids (with the assumption that they're not gamers already) you need to make a game from the ground up that's accessible to them with a relatively low (i.e. non-lame) profile. There's a few games that might be close, but nothing is totally packaged and rady for it. (And by accessible I don't mean "dumbed down", but rather stripping away a lot of off-putting material.)</p>
<p>FWIW, there were a few relative-cool cliques that got a way with having some roleplayers in there. (The drama kids and goths in particular.) But that might have been an anomoly.</p>

                            ::coughs into his hand::<br/><br/>Actually the socio-political environment of the average highschool is way more complicated than "cool" and "geek" and has been so fragmented across focused market groups that...<br/><br/>:: stops::<br/><br/>Okay, to say it without moon speak: kids are ideal subjects for focused marketing. That can include marketing that targets them as geeks, as geek pride is a growing segment that has a lot of money to throw down. However, the game has to then be specifically targeted at geeks and not just fall into the trap of being "kinda generically geeky." You want to geek? GO ALL GEEK. SHOUT NERD UP BIATCH! <br/><br/>Same deal with targeting other segments. All "kids" aren't the same, after all, any more than all adults are. <br/><br/>The big issue with coming at them not through adults (as all the links I was posting above do) is that you then have to show them something cool enough that it gets past the cellphone, videogame, music glut. Kids aren't lacking for entertainment clammoring for their dollar. So if you want them to pay attention you have to give them something different, something they can't get other places. <br/><br/>Of course, tying it into those other things can work too. Something like the Code of Uranis without the massive background, designed to be played via text-message while IN CLASS could have some real possibilities. <br/><br/>Of course, if you sell it to my students I'll crush your nuts.                        </div>

                            I've been thinking a lot about this myself.  The biggest thing I look to is manga.  If you go to any mainstream bookstore, you'll find a fairly large manga section and a gaggle of kids sitting around reading it.  Now, most folks, assume it's just the pretty pictures, but the real thing that keeps kids reading it is that the stories draw on things young folks can identify with better.  In comparison, the american comics (and geek culture minus videogames) has continously crept towards and older and older crowd.<br/><br/>The other thing would be to probably make it very IRC chat friendly, because kids are doing a LOT of roleplaying- just not at tables.                        </div>

                            I think the first question you need to ask is: do you want to design a game that teenagers would have fun playing?  Cause I don't.<br/>
<br/>
I make games for adults -- games about the trainwrecks of idealism and reality, hard choices about sex and violence and identity and the consequences that fall out of the choices made.  It's not kids' fare, and I'd be pretty disturbed if the games I'm most interested in were handed over to fourteen year olds.<br/>
<br/>
Are there games for those kids?  Sure.  And are there some teenagers out there who are capable of playing responsibly and maturely?  Sure.  I'm just saying: look at the audience in question, and really consider if you've got a product for the majority of that audience.  If you don't, you need a different avenue.                        </div>

                            Matt,<br/><br/>There is also a truth to be faced: How many of us were normal teenagers? <br/><br/>I have this discussion all the time about why I have a degree in English/Philosophy/other shit and quit teaching Highschool to teach elementary. As part of it I say "teenagers are not interested in (literary figure -- often T.S. Elliot or the like)" and a friend responds "well I was! I loved (literary work) when I was in High School!" <br/><br/>Then I reply,  "Sure, but you were a freak. In every class of 30 there will be one or two of you. The rest hate being there, and hate me for teaching them shit that they know isn't important and that I know isn't important." <br/><br/>They then say, "But all my friends liked it too." <br/><br/>At which point I usually give up. <br/><br/>Now, if you can make a game that hits that one or two kids out of a class and find a way to get it to them, and find a way to teach them to play it... you may have a market. But it won't be easy, and it certainly isn't the broad spectrum of "younger folks."                        </div>

<p>You certainly can make games that are gripping and interesting to adults and teenagers both. PTA could be an example here: there's nothing in it that would make it eclusively inappropriate for teens, but it's certainly of interest to anyone. I certainly would have gotten a kick out of it as a teen.</p>
<p>I'm actually hoping I can get some of that with <a href="http://mythpunk.forgreatjustice.net/pages/TheDanceAndTheDawn" rel="nofollow">Dance and Dawn</a>. I'd design the game for just other adults in mind, but later realized that it <em>could</em> be totally appropriate for play with much younger players, while still being interesting.</p>

<p>Now, if you can make a game that hits that one or two kids out of a class and find a way to get it to them, and find a way to teach them to play it... you may have a market. But it won't be easy, and it certainly isn't the broad spectrum of "younger folks."</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Right, there are two separate things here. Even if we're just talking about one or two kids in a class, themselves a different "market", there's the problem of exposure and access: how do they find out about it, and how do they get it?</p>

                            Josh, <br/><br/>Historically I think part of the reason was because people got into gaming young, then left as they got older. Thus it became an imperative in the industry to get more young folks in, because it was the only way to keep the hobby alive. <br/><br/>However, as we're really starting to see a lot of games for adults now -- I mean games that adults who never were geeks nor played RPGs in their teens could legitmatly use to get into gaming -- it seems we could be moving into an era in which story-games could stop looking at that focus. <br/><br/>Adventure games and such may still need ways to get to the youth market, but I don't know that Zero at the Bone or Dogs in the Vineyard need to get at teens in order to grow. <br/><br/>Of course, there are still other reasons: money, market share, because teenagers can be cool sometimes, because we want to try something different, etc.                        </div>

It is so bullshit.  One, like Brand says, we can get adults to get into the hobby.  And two, when I was a teenager I had jack for cash.  And the cash I did have I spent on going out, gas for the car, chicks, booze etc.  I got a teenage sister and she ain't spending no money on a game, no matter how fun.  Different priorities, which in my mind means they ain't the target audience I want as a designer/publisher/whatever the fuck I am.                        </div>

                            ...all of which is not to say that this is a bad idea in general!<br/>
<br/>
It's just that, if you want to market to kids, you really should have a reason why.  Is your game specifically tailored to appeal to kids?  Do you have some sort of 'in' with a teenaged market (like Dev here)?  Do you want to write a game for your own kid?<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I'm almost positive that I'll eventually try my hand at an RPG that's useful as an educational tool.  So it'll have to at least appeal, if not market to, its intended end users.<br/>
<br/>
But "I made a game -- let's find some kids to play it" is, well.  Pretty wrong-headed, let's say.                        </div>

<i>Why are we obsessed with attracting young people to become gamers?</i><br/><br/>I think most people are obsessed with it because of the "kids=continued hobby" myth.<br/><br/>I'm interested because I always wanted better games when I was a kid, and I see that  kids are playing Yu-Gi-Oh!, watching Naruto, reading manga, and rp'ing all over the place, and I'd like to help give them what wasn't there for me.  These aren't the "two freaks" in the class, this is a sizable section of the kids.                        </div>

<p>What Chris said.</p>
<p>Honestly, I think that there is a huge area of untapped potential in the exuberant cleverness of modern cartoons - Powerpuff Girls and Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends are brilliant toons. Can we game that? I'd play those. I'd <em>never stop</em> playing those.</p>
