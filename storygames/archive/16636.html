My Domination sucks so rather than play in that context I use my Knowledge to shift to Warfare and have my platoon flank and capture her. I spend a lot to succeed since Knowledge is not my best skill either but I succeed, though racking up some Essence hits. My mind is foggy and some of my men are bordering on mutinous.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext round is Warfare, which I still suck at and she is okay at. But I didn't really want to stay in this context anyway -- the context I wanted was Diplomacy, it's just that the path from Domination to Diplomacy was hard for me (Subterfuge; not good at it). Anyway I have more dice now and can succeed more cheaply with what I really want, which is to use Knowledge again which is the path from Warfare to Diplomacy. Diplomacy I am good at. I win that one and my men corner her, forcing her to listen to what I have to say.<br/>\n<br/>\nThing is, Diplomacy is the witch's denial -- she can't do it at all. I was betting on that and fairly easily win the Diplomacy fight, playing my allies (powerful gods) against hers (a relatively obscure and weak god). She decides that discretion is the better part of valour and that her god would be pretty pissed if someone brought Greater Powers into this. She flees.

The marine sergeant is neck-deep in corruption, running the Dimber Damber (!) and administering merciless beatings at will. His weak-ass Captain of Marines threatens the Emancipist with re-arrest if she doesn't get Sergeant Lunatic, who loves the Emancipist from afar, back in line. And The Abbott tells her the sergeant is pretty much the only thing standing between the hated Authority and a successful coup d'etat.

She won't go hungry.<br/><br/>Oaths:<br/><br/>Sergeant: <i>I will never moderate my exercise of power.</i><br/>Emancipist: <i>I will never betray the sergeant.</i><br/><br/>The scene begins and we see the softer, ickier side of the sergeant, who really loves the Emancipist and is super nice to her. He gives her some real chocolate he stole from Her Excellency the Governor. They drink some convict hooch together. Will she sweet talk him into standing down?? What's her play? It's a little uncertain so we roll for it, and what comes up are tied ones and a two: "Improbable love". <br/><br/>The Emancipist was crying, and the sergeant thought they were tears of joy. Turns out she saw the kindness in this beast, the good side of him. Turns out she loved him, at least a little. <br/><br/>Turns out she broke her fucking oath and left a bomb in his room.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_380996">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380996/#Comment_380996" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-06T10:08:08+00:00" title="June  6, 2012 10:08AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On Sunday I played Fiasco with a couple of friends.

For his Destiny, I wrote, "... he watches as the tears in the vial turn to blood." So the other player wrote the first half of the sentence: "As meteors sent by the gods themselves rain down..." And lo, between the two of us, the third player's Destiny was written.<br/><br/>During the last scene, one player described a volcanic eruption during the climactic battle. And then we all realized, at pretty much exactly the same time, that it was going to fit perfectly. Sure enough, another player narrated how the ash thickened in the sky over this wintry realm, and became huge chunks of stone that fell, like meteors, to the ground, just as the Battle Mage captured the bloody tears of the undead dragon in his vial. Destiny fulfilled. Really wonderful how it all came together.<br/><br/>Running the game with dice was fun, but the minis added a whole new level of insanity: <a href="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/grail.jpg" rel="nofollow">A Grail Epoch</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381703/#Comment_381703" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-10T07:41:58+00:00" title="June 10, 2012  7:41AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><b>Sagas of the Icelanders</b><br/><br/>Things get real when we realize that "hospitality" is a resource and the steading is about to run out.

There's a guy, Jimmy, I've gotten to know because he's in there for misdemeanor grift about as often as I'm in there on D&amp;D. It's weird, because his twin brother is this hot-shit plastic surgeon whose mug we all see on billboards all over town, and the doc's got kind of a thing for my Manager.<br/><br/>Long story short, losing my lucky Dean Martin cuff links sends me on a bender, the doc starts to get super-weird, Sarah has second thoughts, and its all Jimmy can do to help me with this Russian hooker who's nodded off in my bathtub. The gig goes... badly. Teller walks out, I take a tumble off the stage and end up in the hospital, where the doc finally snaps and tries to get Sarah to pose for pics at gunpoint; it turns out he's remade his former plain Jane of a wife into the spitting image of Sarah, and just needs a couple more reference shots for her to be 'perfect'.<br/><br/>So, yeah, basically, it was a case of magnificent self-destruction, with a side dish of confusion, followed by pain. Sarah ended up back in a g-string and pasties, the doc was comatose when his brother drove the car into that billboard truck and walked away with his ID. For my part, taking the cash the doc stole from those drug dealers to try and bribe Sarah and spending it around town? Not my best career move, as witness my corpse, throat cut, tossed in this shallow grave about an hour drive out of town...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381803">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381803/#Comment_381803" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-10T22:51:32+00:00" title="June 10, 2012 10:51PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Who has two thumbs and was the first to play the Angel?

The colony began to disintegrate and three factions emerged - the remnants of Authority, the remnants of the Dimber Damber's criminal enterprise, and an unlikely coalition of proto-communist convict idealists. Amid starvation and an equally-deadly power outage, the surviving lags basically voted with their feet. Earlier a broken oath (the Governor's) had changed the colony's drive from Freedom to Harmony, and a late game tie injected "a quiet moment of dignity". So when the lags voted, they voted for the old status quo, before the uprising, before the killing, before the starving time. They rallied around Her Excellency and the game ended with the Dimber Damber and the idealists up against a wall wondering what went wrong.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_382270">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382270/#Comment_382270" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-14T04:10:22+00:00" title="June 14, 2012  4:10AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 14, 2012 6:57PM by Teataine.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            BW: There's been a murder in a monastery.

Fort Folsom. Omie, the hardholder's right hand has had his brain opened up by accident when the Angel laid his hands on him and now he's all googly-eyed, suicidal and mumbling about death so they had to tie him down. <br/><br/>Queue the driver botches his juggling and gets bushwacked. He's put on the spot and makes a deal with The Announcer who had screwed over Christmas the operator years ago. The Announcer wants to be the first to get to the preapocalyptic compound that Christmas is trying to locate for Old Man Clancy, the benevolent tyrant from the next town over.<br/><br/>Christmas is both broken and disfigured from leading a frenzied attack to win the hardhold back from Gnarly's mutiny. He is a changed man from his early days of caution and fearfulness. He's slamming his comrades into walls and boiling with rage. When the Angel tries to heal him, his hatred spreads through their opened brains like an infection.<br/><br/>The religious community of Palmyra Springs up in the mountains has been devastated, the people enslaved or eaten. Dustwich's been here.<br/><br/>An operational geothermal power station is uncovered. I give Cookie the savvyhead a custom move to commune with the consoles and he starts it up. A map of the power grid that indicates the location of the compound is found. Grave the brainer tries to hide the maps from the Announcer's men that are tagging along for insurance.<br/><br/>Dustwitch is on the road to Folsom. After seven sessions of buildup, there is a panicked response. Grave tries to feel out the caravan, by opening his brain. He gets good detail. What was the worst thing that you've done with your mind? I told a man to kill himself.<br/><br/>Christmas, far away, desperate for some information opens his brain with -1. The world falls apart and he stands on the night fields, alone with Dustwich's shadow. He tries to walk closer but there's Grave stepping from behind the shadow. Dream|Grave looks deep into Christmas' eyes. Kill yourself. Christmas rolls the expanded under fire and gets a moment of grace. No. Not today. The world is firm again. He takes the sniper rifle, hops on a motorcycle and rides off to meet Dustwich's procession on the road. On the other side of the plain, Grave, Cookie and The Announcer's men ride down the mountain with the same destination.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_382367">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382367/#Comment_382367" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-14T19:34:23+00:00" title="June 14, 2012  7:34PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We filmed some dramatic Fiasco.

D'Guloo, the alien Merchant, lost control of his hovercraft while blowing the back window out of said 4x4 with a shotgun and went careening into the back of the thieves' vehicle. Oops.<br/><br/>Our "heroes" got away, but couldn't figure out how to get a bullet-ridden truck past the starport security and to their tramp merchant ship. So D'Guloo used his com-link to call Fixta, an old friend who was managing bands for the huge music festival there on Noctae V. So after a quick vehicle/cargo switch, they drove innocently into the starport in the gig van for BleachMeister, one of the opening bands. Then picked up their ersatz passenger and two young female rock groupies who had never been off-world but begged to come along "with the band".<br/><br/>The groupies landed on plague-ridden New Victoria and immediately became volunteer nurses. A happy ending (so to speak).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_382623">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noah_D" title="Noah_D"><img alt="Noah_D" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noah_D">Noah_D</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382623/#Comment_382623" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-17T21:47:51+00:00" title="June 17, 2012  9:47PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [MicroTraveller 1]\n<blockquote><i>MicroTraveller</i>, my Classic Traveller homage to John Harper's World of Dungeons.</blockquote>\nI want this, how do I get it?<br/><br/>Also, very much a classic Classic Traveller adventure. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_382646">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382646/#Comment_382646" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-18T02:20:43+00:00" title="June 18, 2012  2:20AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>[MicroTraveller 1]\n<blockquote><i>MicroTraveller</i>, my Classic Traveller homage to John Harper's World of Dungeons.</blockquote>\nI want this, how do I get it?</blockquote>\nVery early playtesting.

The world was consumed by a faepocalypse, and the PC's had settled in a strip mall that used to reside in Chicago, but the city was broken apart by darkened forests, giant roots, impossible rivers, and other absurd enchantments.<br/><br/>The Maestro D was a trangsressing gentleman in constant surveillance to maintain a status quo of mundanity (so as not to attract the nearby lords and their wrath). The Chopper had a gang of savages he kept in line with a row of skulls on his bike. Our Gunlugger was a mowhawked lesbian with a big pink gun and grenade launcher, and she patrolled the iron fence that was plastered with bills and reciepts to ward off the fae. And our Faceless ran the McDonalds, serving breakfast patties every morning to the small community.<br/><br/>Most memorable scenes:<br/>The Maestro D and the Faceless attacking the Seagull headed Thin White Prince in a grove by a beech tree. A downpour of gutted seagulls fell on them, the Faceless turned on the Maestro D because his mask told him to, and in the end they made a deal with the fae and made love amidst the dead birds.<br/><br/>The Chopper and Gunlugger set out to the Labyrinth to raid, a connection of tent cities that resided in the subway. The gunlugger opened her brain to find "Her" to guide them to tires, and a creepy long black haired wet shadow crawled out of the rail tracks to give her advice about the tunnels. The rats were a problem, but March could give them what they needed.<br/><br/>Tum Tum (a woman in the choppers gang) was consumed by ice. A child (Billie) started bleeding from his eyes and the Faceless decided he had to kill him to get the fae out. The ghosts of children haunt the strip mall. And something called the Baron Blake is coming for them, with his winter wolves. It was a fun session and a great world that we created together. Looking forward to playing amidst the faepocalypse again!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_382698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382698/#Comment_382698" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-18T15:37:30+00:00" title="June 18, 2012  3:37PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (You guys are a bunch of weirdos Kira)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_382703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith" title="Keith"><img alt="Keith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/41781_139848736039153_8022_q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith">Keith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382703/#Comment_382703" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-18T16:17:14+00:00" title="June 18, 2012  4:17PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [Faepocalypse World 3]<br/><br/>That sounds AMAZING!

The Knight persuaded the King to repeal the practice, but sacrifices still persisted underground, so the King formed a sort of Secret Police to root out the illegal sacrificers witchhunter-style. The Princess spied on the Earl and Sei\xf0kona's lovemaking and learned of their fiendish plot, and told the Knight. He confronted the Sei\xf0kona and learned she was poisoning the King and Earl both. The knight made one last plea to her to end all this, but when she callously demurred, he realized in anguish that he had chosen poorly in love, even as the Princess lay dying, having been struck down by angered ancestor-spirits. He became a wolf, tore out the Sei\xf0kona's throat and fled, becoming a dark rumour stalking the Kingdom, another portent of its downfall.<br/><br/>With the jig up, the Earl retreated to his homeland, and the Secret Police staged a coup to establish a more egalitarian government which overturned many repressive customs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383156">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383156/#Comment_383156" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-23T02:12:09+00:00" title="June 23, 2012  2:12AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 23, 2012 4:32PM by Hans_c-o.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Our seventh and final session of Freemarket. <b>NOTE: There is violence toward a pregnant woman in this story.</b><br/><br/>The MRCZ, Re/!/Mem, is all about "finding the perfect experience". They've danced around this goal for six sessions. Through an artistic performance they've made 6.3 Jen (a sometime girlfriend of one of PCs) want to get pregnant, on her own, and experience the bonds of motherhood. Forty days later, they bring her into Re/!/Mem HQ to ask if they can take her gestating baby's first memory. She's hesitant. They Socially Engineer her. "This will be a breakthrough in science. Knowing the first memory of a human infant will be an historic moment." She gradually sheds her hesitation and agrees to it.<br/><br/>The baby's memory is "the shocking bliss of being brought into existence and being one with another being." A couple of the PCs pass the memory around, experiencing it. Jen leaves. After quick discussion, Re/!/Mem decides to death Jen, as she could be a threat to them using this memory for mercenary purposes (have people line up, sign a contract, experience the memory, and give it back). It's a Perfect Death, 6.3 Jen being garroted, gassed, and bashed in front of Re/!/Mem HQ. When her body is re-printed, there's no baby.<br/><br/>The session spiraled from there, with the two responsible for the deathing being frownied into oblivion after Jen's MRCZ--the Pie Shoppe--Thin Sliced the video feed of Jen's death all over the station. One tanked PC Switched at the last minute to avoid being booted off the station, one gave up in disgust and voluntarily left. The other two PC members of Re/!/Mem were left to pick up the pieces, one of them still holding the memory.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383158">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383158/#Comment_383158" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-23T02:25:45+00:00" title="June 23, 2012  2:25AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Quiet Year:<br/><br/>Our community was set in the tundra, adjacent to the ocean and to a scraggly forest.

Sorry.<br/>At any rate.<br/><br/>Old Man Yu (loyal to the group of "supervisors" but also to "fair treatment of the Chinese workers") begins the game trying to convince the ruthless shark Mr. Ren (loyal to "money" and "keeping himself alive") to let his workers off for the Moon's birthday festival.  He says that their freedom can be bought if Yu want's to pay their wages.  Talk is useless, so wire work ensues.<br/>Yu has the home turf advantage, in the sun-scorched canyon.  His joints pop and crack from his curled, question-mark spine as he kicks the thug off balance and grabs his collar with the tip of his cane, dangling him like a plank of wood over the steep drop.  Things escalated from there.  Yu is kidnapped for ransom instead of getting the workers a day off.<br/><br/>Later, Willamina Williams (of the rail-terrorist mentioned earlier, loyal to her gang, but also to her unrequited love "Big Hong", and also to the Spirits that allow her to practice voodoo) is getting ready to blow some dynamite and end some Chinese heading off to work for the day, when some no account white boy (loyal to a fast dollar and action) shows up to steal the explosives for his own plans.  He makes off with them, but is trailed by a Williams' Boy who seems loyal only to "blowing stuff up."<br/><br/>Mr Ren offers audience to his second-in-command inside his luxurious tent (pillows, high tea, servants... Old Man Yu tied to a post and gagged).  Mr. Ren discusses his plans, but the second is reluctant, angered and confused as to why Yu is bound up.  He tears away the Old Man's gag and Old Man Yu  demands that if he has any honor, he'll kill Mr. Ren and bring justice to the Chinese people.  (Yu's player passed the drawn knife to the secone-in-command)<br/>Mr. Ren and his second fight fiercely, but pull their punches in the end.  Mr. Ren is defeated, but the second finds mercy "You still have a place in this organization, just not at the top..."<br/><br/>So much tension built up, but we ran out of time in our slot, so it was left unexplored.<br/><br/>The highlight?  Willamina drawing on the power of the "Jade Turtle" in the very fight where she winds up losing it.  It was narrated as:<br/><i>The spirits are angry with her for drawing on a different power for her magic, and it is ejected painfully from her grasp and into his instead.</i><br/><br/>Hot.<br/>Did I mention that she stole if from her unrequited love, so that she could parade it around and say "Look what he gave me!  He surely loves me..."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383325">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pandajelley" title="pandajelley"><img alt="pandajelley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pandajelley">pandajelley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383325/#Comment_383325" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-25T10:46:32+00:00" title="June 25, 2012 10:46AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            MonsterHearts<br/><br/>Female ghost, killed a few weeks ago, crushing on a jock that she's always been attracted to for being more full of life than she ever was.

I'm not MCing! I actually get to play! First session. The game is set in the Maryland suburbs. We have four characters.<br/><br/>Gail: A fae boy who grew up in foster care. Rather optimistic and friendly, likes it when everyone gets along. So far, the shiny ray of hope in our little coterie. And the most likely to take all his clothes off for a swim in the ocean. Just wants to play with the other kids, but his enthusiasm is often off-putting instead of infectious.<br/><br/>Rowan: A selkie boy who's quirks outnumber his knowledge about pop culture. Or what cigarettes are. Dangerously naive, with a dash of trickster. Will often cave to other people's desires, but only for a lack of understanding. I'm certain this will fade after being in town for longer than a week. Or after the appropriate amount of abuse pushes him too far.<br/><br/>Cole: A ghoul boy who likes the taste of flesh. He died in a car accident, but didn't really. He's got the selkie pelt, mostly because he thought it was something he could eat, but now realizes a more potent sadistic control he can extort from the creature. An ex-jock, he's still a bit of an asshole, but has a secret desire for Gail. Which is not so secret after their swim in the ocean last night.<br/><br/>Cassidy (me!): A werewolf girl who has her mom and sister to take care of back at the trailer park. She just wants out, but she can't get out, so the rage builds instead. Bitten by a wolf, she's never met others of her kind. Hyper defensive of her friends, but for all the wrong reasons. Thinks Cole is a werewolf too, since the scent of flesh is often hanging about him. (We did a fun thing with her trigger... everyone wrote one down secretly and passed it to the MC... so I actually don't know what it is that makes her go wolf crazy. Scary.)<br/><br/>Generally, we harassed each other, got in character, built tension. No one had sex yet, but strings were exchanged, and seductions had. Rowan went dumpster diving for meat for Cole at the promise of a returned pelt, not followed up on of course. Gail tried skateboarding for the first time. Cassidy got in a fight with the local bikers at the trailer park. The session ended with the bikers and one of Cassidy's friends Alicia dead, ripped apart, and a dark gentleman nodding to her and heading into the darkness. So it begins.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383344/#Comment_383344" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-25T13:44:05+00:00" title="June 25, 2012  1:44PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Durance.

If you haven't played <i>Archipelago</i>, it's a story-driven game in which you draw a map with various locations on it, and during play, you mark down which characters are in which locations, and you write down any in-game changes to the map as you play.<br/><br/>In <i>A Grail Epoch</i>, you start with 12 locations, connected by 9 lines, and you place miniatures on the map's locations. When it's your turn to set a scene, you move three miniatures (one of which must be your character) up to two locations (along the drawn lines), and then you tell the other players who's playing which characters, and off you go.<br/><br/>This time around, out of the twelve locations on the map, three were 'locked' -- we couldn't reach them until a character had died (one death per location). Then, we also had new connections: for each character who died after that, we could connect two previously unconnected locations.<br/><br/>The scenario played out on a cruise ship in the Bermuda Triangle. A golden zeppelin hovered above the ship, and smoke billowed from a volcano on a nearby island. And all the characters had amnesia.<br/><br/>Player 1 had played the game before, but Player 2 was new to it. Here's what they had to say:<br/><br/>PLAYER 1<br/><br/>"I had no idea how we were going to tie mysterious black totems, glowing babies, injectable goo, and zeppelins together, but it all worked out perfectly in the end."<br/><br/>PLAYER 2<br/><br/>"My overall favorite moment of the night was Raf's earnest inquiry about the death of an NPC.\xa0He was logically enforcing the rules of the game, but it was pretty funny in context.<br/><br/>Jim:\xa0'A single beam of light erupts from the Black Totem into the space just vacated by Murphy.\xa0Murphy's fall has saved him... but Jenkins isn't so lucky.\xa0A gaping hole -- roughly the size of a basketball -- has been seared through the entire middle of her chest mass. She pauses for a brief second of wide-eyed horror before crumpling upon the deck.'<br/><br/>Raf absorbs this scenario and then queries:\xa0'Does she survive?'<br/><br/>Jim nearly sprays Matt with his sip of coffee.<br/><br/>And THIS is what was so awesome about this game.\xa0In my mind, according to the narrative above, there was no WAY that Jenkins was surviving that blast. However, the rules of the game allowed for the possibility for her to stand up and dust herself off, along with some awesomely demented reason from Matt or Raf as to how this could have possibly occurred. Total creative freedom within a framework - awesome, awesome experience."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_384030">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384030/#Comment_384030" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-01T03:09:41+00:00" title="July  1, 2012  3:09AM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My Daughter Queen of France<br/><br/>We seem to be honing in on two things that are the crux of Shakespeare and Titania's estrangement - one, that he was a control freak, 'writing' and 'directing' her life, making her play the part of the daughter he wanted her to be. And two, that after his wife's death he was having an affair with an actress, Phoebe, and she was also molding Titania, but these two threads felt separate to me.<br/><br/>So we run through the estrangement scene again. And Martin, playing Shakespeare, calls Titania, "Phoebe."<br/>Marc / Titania: "Did you just call me Phoebe?!"<br/>Martin, out of character: "Oh, no, I meant Titania, it was just that the last time I played the daughter was named Phoebe."<br/>"No way!" I (Shakespeare) said. "That stays!"<br/><br/>So I made "Did you just call me Phoebe?" a certainty, and replayed the scene, which had a pretty awesome end where Titania reveals not only that she's leaving but also that she really hates this new mother figure in her life.<br/><br/><br/>We win.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_384033">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384033/#Comment_384033" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-01T06:49:09+00:00" title="July  1, 2012  6:49AM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hans: THIS sounds like an excellent use of Freemarket.

Tried out Number Appearing for Dungeon world with Murgh_Bpurn and jjafuller.  Our two PCs were Spit, a goblin thief, and Argh, a minotaur fighter.<br/><br/>Spit and Argh live in an ancient tunnel complex ruled by a vengeful Draugr who is none too kind to his charges.  Although the meanest creature in the dungeon is the were-boar Hellrunner.  He wears an apron made of goblin skin just to remind Spit and his kin of the natural order of things.  There is an unmapped section in the north of the dungeon that Hellrunner rules where You Shall Not Go.  Fortunately, dungeon life has a few benefits, such as the buffet just across the river AKA the hobbit village.  But alas, those blasted hairy-feet have begun to develop a new defense system.  Spit and Argh are sent out for reconnaissance.  <br/><br/>Spit hides in the reeds while Argh decides that the best way to find out the hobbits' defenses is to charge right into him.  Before he can act on this, a Hill Giant from the mountains above the dungeon comes lumbering down for his own choice pick from the buffet.  Argh grabs some branches and holds still, pretending to be a tree.  Spit pretends to be a bush.  Things go poorly.  Hairy-feets have a goblin race-traitor casting darkness magic.  Hill giant tries to strangle Argh.  Spit backstabs him, loosening his grip.  Argh tosses the giant into the darkness, where he screams writhes.  Darkness chases Spit.  <br/><br/>Somehow both of our heroes (?) make it back to the dungeon.  Spit reports what they have seen, but his (ancient and incompetent) shaman supervisor, Squagg, chastises him for failing to bring back dinner.  But that\u2019s not what I was told!  Doesn\u2019t matter, Spit is shamed as his clan goes without food.  If only that were the worst of the dungeon dweller\u2019s problems.<br/><br/>The traps on the perilously steep spiral staircase are sprung; the hairy-feet and their traitorous sorcerer have entered the dungeon!  The darkness begins to descend from the ceiling.  Spit dispatches Hellrunner\u2019s orc whelp slave to fetch the ferocious were-boar .  The faithless,  vile mage is killed, but his spell lingers on.  Argh grabs one of the hairy-feet and holds him up the ceiling, thrusting him into the darkness.  The darkness disappears, as does the hairy-foot.  Win win.  One hill dweller remained, cowering against the wall with his broken spear held uselessly in front of him.  He begs for his life.  Spit walks up and crushes the hairy-foot\u2019s skull with the butt of his dagger.  He turns to Squagg and says \u201cI brought dinner.\u201d  Another problem solved.  But what will happen when hill giants find out just who killed their tribe member?  And even scarier, what will happen when Hellrunner shows up lusting for hairy-foot blood and there\u2019s no battle to be had?<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_384065">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384065/#Comment_384065" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-01T19:01:51+00:00" title="July  1, 2012  7:01PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Played some Meikyuu Kingdom with Matt Sanchez, Andy Kitkowski  and Mark Causey , lots of fun. It takes random tables to a strange and functional upper bound, some liminal space between the absurd and the indefinable. At one point we slew five adorable Ogrekin after a small (and, yes, random) mistake. What treasure would we glean from their lifeless bodies? Matt rolled some dice. "Seven fangs and a bento lunch," he said.<br/><br/>Another time we had to choose equipment, and my top three choices were an apron, a frog safe, or a reference library.<br/><br/>Beyond being an explosion of J-creativity craziness, Meikyuu Kingdom is also stuffed - stuffed - with really cool ideas large and small. Very exciting, very cool. The stuff that isn't new and cool was new and cool before we saw it in, say, Apocalypse World or Hero's Banner or whatever. Anyway I was impressed after my brief exposure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_384077">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384077/#Comment_384077" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-02T01:08:34+00:00" title="July  2, 2012  1:08AM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Wicked Archipelago</i><br/><br/>One of our oracles was "The ascension to mastery of a student wizardess, unrecognized by her order but absolutely clear and undeniable to her inner self."<br/><br/>So Sev played the student and I played her inner self, constantly whispering murderous thoughts during her scenes, and giving her a nightmare vision and bringing back horrible memories in my scene.
