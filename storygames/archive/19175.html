However I\u2019m not very experienced in the field, so I wonder what kinds of scenarios interest people?  I\u2019ve tried some of John Harper\u2019s scenarios (Lady Blackbird and Ghost Lines) and I loved them. Especially the fact that they\u2019re so open that they indeed invite repeated play. <br/><br/>However, the project I\u2019m working on has landed at the other end of the spectrum. It has a narrow focus, a controlled chronology and the characters' secret backgrounds are integral to play, meaning once you\u2019ve played it it loses quite a bit in replay value. It also has intrigue playing built in, which I\u2019ve been told is not really a good idea for one-offs with strangers. Compared to Lady Blackbird it feels like making a list of everything that's good in it and ignoring that.<br/><br/>But my idea was born out of the feeling that I so far haven\u2019t found a scenario that captures Reservoir Dogs in a good way. But that may simply be me not having searched thoroughly enough.<br/><br/>So basically my question boils down to this: Is there already a one-shot out there that nicely captures the Reservoir Dogs feeling that you can\u2019t trust anybody?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo" title="w00hoo"><img alt="w00hoo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/395/nB2PXS15U6BFQ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo">w00hoo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427711/#Comment_427711" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-28T04:20:54+00:00" title="January 28, 2014  4:20AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            While not modern era, <a href="http://www.ukroleplayers.com/witch/" rel="nofollow">Witch</a> does this pretty well.
