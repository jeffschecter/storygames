And not just win, but basically win all the time. Like <i>all</i> the time. Any failure is a disaster of epic proportions and they will do anything and everything in their power to avoid failure, even on the most basic or meaningless tasks. (By basic and meaningless I just mean things that are important enough to roll the dice for, but not life or death, character loss, loss of control, etc). They will spend whatever plot/fate/story points they have to avoid failing any roll they have to make, and if possible, spend the same to avoid any setback/damage/stress/mild complication that gets in their way.<br/><br/>Yet, by and large, these are the same people who eat up the fiction associated with their genre(s) of choice. One of the things about fiction (whether prose or film) is that the characters basically never win till the absolute end of the story. In gamer terms, they "fail forward" throughout the story, and only decisively, clearly, actually succeed at something in the last bit of the story, the climax. There might be a few minor successes here and there along the way, but they're mostly going to be "success at cost" rather than a simple, decisive success. Why? Because it makes for a boring story if the character is just winning all the time.<br/><br/>So it seems that what makes for good stories and good gaming are polar opposites. Or at least, what makes for good stories and what most gamers seem to want out of game play polar opposites. I know there are quite a few games that have versions of "fail forward" and "succeed at cost" mechanics, they're really popular in the last few years, but are there any games that rely almost exclusively on those? And as a gamer, would you get frustrated with that setup?<br/><br/>To go all fiction, you basically have a character with a goal enter a location where there's someone or something who opposes that character's goal. There's a bit of action/reaction that happens, then the scene ends with some kind of disaster for the character. Good story boils down to the drama and tension that result from the constant conflict between the character's goals and their failure to achieve those goals. Two steps forward, one step back. One step forward, two steps back.<br/><br/>To go all traditional gaming, you basically have a character with a clear goal who wades through minor adversity at best, slowly whittling away at some resources (if any) as they march irrevocable onward toward their goal. Yes, in lots of story games this is flipped around and the games are designed to more closely match fiction, but a lot of them fall short, to me at least. I wonder if something as structured as most fiction is would really work as a game structure. Could you really take a game system, input the players' choices, and get a result that was actually something akin to the fiction?<br/><br/>For me it seems to come back to that again and again, more closely mirroring the fiction in structure and form. The closer a game gets to that, the better I like it; the further away a game gets from that, the less I like it. I know there are a few games out there that explicitly do this, Fiasco and Primetime Adventures are two, are there any others where the end product of the gaming experience is meant to be at least a fiction-adjacent type thing? It seems the gamier they get, the further they are away from producing fiction. Even games designed to mimic licensed TV properties done in more story gaming formats don't produce the kind of fiction I'm talking about, and suffer from the players bending over backwards to avoid anything bad happening to their characters at all, for example <i>Smallville</i> and <i>Firefly</i>. Great games in and of themselves, but to have an end result that mimics the TV shows they're based on, you need to seriously railroad at times and simply deny players the ability to avoid the consequences of the story (re: plot points).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434842">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434842/#Comment_434842" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-04T14:04:33+00:00" title="July  4, 2014  2:04PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Uhhh...in Smallville your character can't actually advance unless you fail - like, not just give in, they have to get <i>beat</i>.

It's not a question of imposed/railroaded linear story from the beginning, rather a question of what results from play being a coherent, story-like thing. Rather than looking at it from beginning to end and imposing a linear story on the game (ie railroading), looking at it from after the session(s) are over and seeing a coherent story there. I don't mean imposing a specific story, I mean imposing the structure of a story. <br/><br/>By "coherent story", I mean scenes that have characters with a goal, in a location, opposed by someone or something. That scene having a question (will the character accomplish their goal?), there being some back and forth between the character and their opposition (twists and turns), the scene resolving with a setback for the character (a gap between their expected outcome and the actual outcome). The character deciding what to do next, declaring their goal and moving to the next scene. On a larger scale there being an arc to the story, rising action, a low point, a climax. You know... Story. <br/><br/>Fiasco and PTA do a lot of this by structuring play around act breaks and making scenes have explicit goals. What the specific story is from the start is irrelevant, that game play is structured around story structure is important. That what comes out through play, and the artifact of the play experience is story-like is important.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434856/#Comment_434856" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-04T23:28:16+00:00" title="July  4, 2014 11:28PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 4, 2014 11:29PM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>but are there any games that rely almost exclusively on those? And as a gamer, would you get frustrated with that setup?</blockquote>\nI remember hearing about this totally weird game, what was it called, Apocalypse World?<br/><br/>I mean, your analysis of fiction seems super-reductive, so I don't feel so bad positing AW as a game that fits the bill, since the 7-9 result is 'failing forward' from the point of view of your theoretical gaming-dude-who-must-win-everything, and 7-9 results are the engine that drives the apocalypse.<br/><br/>But I can't help but point out that only every second scene in Fiasco*, which you (rightly) hold up as a marvel of story-generating technology ends in anything approximating disaster -- the dice distribution mechanic guarantees that about half the scenes end with the character getting more or less what they want. It's all the other things in the game -- including genre-specific parameters for both 'more or less' and 'what they want' -- that are responsible for the game doing such a good job of emulating certain types of narrative. Personally I would describe much Fiasco play as characters 'succeeding towards disaster' rather than 'failing towards success'.<br/><br/>For failing towards success games, you'd probably have some luck looking at basically any modern/indie superhero game, since they often rely on characters very explicitly building up resources by failing disastrously, only to succeed in the final frame.<br/><br/>Still it seems like kind of a red herring to me, as most games like this (and probably most stories) actually feature a mix of character success and failure. They just tend to promote the idea that both success and failure have interesting consequences which are often beyond the characters' immediate control.<br/><br/>* And PTA, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434857/#Comment_434857" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-04T23:49:15+00:00" title="July  4, 2014 11:49PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, that's exactly the Smallville conflict system.

The reason that ends up looking like "expecting to win all the time" to some people is because it is <i>seriously difficult</i> to structure a conflict in such a way that winning or losing doesn't impact how interesting and fun the conclusion of the conflict will be. (Almost all of the GM advice that tells people to make failure as interesting and fun as winning doesn't actually tell them <i>how</i> to do that, sadly, and so many conflicts end up being designed in such a way that failure <i>can't</i> be as interesting and fun as success, which then makes it even harder to move forward with the story. Badly-constructed conflicts have bad failures, and bad failures kill games.)<br/><br/><br/>Oh, and this quote made me think of something:<blockquote>That scene having a question (will the character accomplish their goal?), </blockquote>\n...now I'm envisioning a game where the scenes adhere strictly to <a href="http://movieline.com/2010/03/23/david-mamets-memo-to-the-writers-of-the-unit/" rel="nofollow">David Mamet's infamous memo to TV writers</a>, in which he sets forth the principle "START, EVERY TIME, WITH THIS INVIOLABLE RULE: THE SCENE MUST BE DRAMATIC. IT MUST START BECAUSE THE HERO HAS A PROBLEM, AND IT MUST CULMINATE WITH THE HERO FINDING HIM OR HERSELF EITHER THWARTED OR EDUCATED THAT ANOTHER WAY EXISTS."<br/><br/>In other words, a game where the question is explicitly never "Will the character accomplish their goal?", but rather, "What will this scene force the character to do next, since their goal is not achievable this way?" I don't really know what that kind of game would look like, let alone play like, but I imagine that as you got closer to the end, you'd feel more like you had been refining an approach towards your goal and effectively ruling out bad options and stacking the deck for the final conflict in your favor.<br/><br/><br/>(edit: Smallville at least leaned strongly in that direction, I think, by making conflicts explicitly about <i>not getting what you asked for</i> and also by using failures to pay for advancement. You could still stumble into some pointless dead-end waste-of-time scenes, of course, but it seemed harder to do over and over and over again.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434864">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Oren" title="Oren"><img alt="Oren" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Oren">Oren</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434864/#Comment_434864" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-05T04:57:22+00:00" title="July  5, 2014  4:57AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are success and failure really so central to fiction?<br/><br/>Obviously some stock plots do revolve around characters failing or succeeding - sports movies, for example. But even then, the outcome is never really in doubt (the underdogs will win at the last minute), so the success-or-failure tension must not be central to our enjoyment. And many genres have little to do with success and failure - the buddy cop movie, the road trip, family drama, etc. <br/><br/>I think perhaps "does the protagonist succeed or fail in this scene" isn't such a useful way to examine a story. Maybe "what does the protagonist give up or insist on" (as in Drama System) comes closer to what actually grabs us as consumers of fiction. <br/><br/>Which isn't to say game mechanics shouldn't model success and failure, only that these are secondary concepts. (Much like D&amp;D mechanics revolve around hit points which don't exist in the fiction at all.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434866">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434866/#Comment_434866" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-05T05:57:47+00:00" title="July  5, 2014  5:57AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You can still have characters/players struggle toward their goals.

My first reaction is that there are two things at play here:<br/><br/>1. A system/game/procedure which produces satisfactory story-like narratives. We have a LOT of these here in the Story Games community - I'd argue that MOST of the games coming out of this culture are very much "fail forward" games, where success is not only the default assumption, but often the players delight in seeing the unpleasant and horrible things that happen to their characters (e.g. Fiasco). <br/><br/>In other words, what you're describing is very, very common in these games, with various levels of success/failure built-in. There are dozens and dozens of games which achieve this very well. I'd look at games like <i>Grey Ranks</i>, <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>, <i>Fiasco</i>, <i>With Great Power...</i>, <i>My Life with Master</i>, <i>Polaris</i>, <i>Monsterhearts</i>, <i>Otherkind Dice</i> (or <i>Ghost/Echo</i>), <i>Archipelago</i>, <i>In a Wicked Age...</i>, <i>Shab-al-hiri Roach</i>, <i>Kagematsu</i>, <i>nicotine girls</i>, <i>Dread</i>, etc, etc. <i>Gun Thief</i> is a particularly interesting and very short game which might be worth looking at for this purpose.<br/><br/>The OSR might be an interesting study, too - here everyone TRIES to win, but everyone plays with the awareness that they will most likely lose, at least a lot of the time, and, at least at some level, really looks forward to those losses.<br/><br/>Also: Call of Cthulhu. Here, like in Fiasco, at least in some modes of play, no one even tries to "win", but plays to see what it looks like when they "lose".<br/><br/>2. A group of players who approach the game with the right mindset. If you can't get the players on the same page about why to play the game, you're not going to have much luck. A hypothetical group of players who play every moment to WIN will simply not be able to play a game like Fiasco without adjusting their assumptions (or changing the game somehow). The game falls apart if you try to "play to win" at every step of the way.<br/><br/>In my experience, it is very much not true that all gamers approach games this way. Lots of people play while looking forward to losing just as much as they do to winning. (We'd had a number of discussions here in praise of a technique called "playing to lose", which is considered pretty key for a number of games. It's notable, I think, that this is what the GM does all the time in a typical RPG. And in the games we're discussing, a common feature is making all players share the GM role to a lesser or greater extent - so there may be some connection here, as well. Look at games like <i>Trollbabe</i>, where the rule is that each player narrates their own failure, for example.)<br/><br/>However, I have seen <i>some</i> gamers exhibit this attitude. A very, very few really do play "only to win". The majority of this subgroup, instead, are used to a certain form of gaming which takes the form of jockeying for advantage continuously, as much as possible. In my experience, most of these players turn around (and really enjoy themselves) when they play a game which operates on a different basis enough to learn to trust that process: "this will be fun and I will enjoy myself even when I stop trying to win". Once that thought settles in (and is supported by a game which is still fun even while they are "losing"), the player drops their playstyle and adapts to a different one (and usually finds it quite liberating).<br/><br/>Many, many indie RPGs (e.g. <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>, <i>Fiasco</i>) straight-up <i>fail</i> when played "to win", and only function when all the players stop trying to win and pursue the creative goals the game presents instead.<br/><br/>So:<br/><br/>Yeah, you need a game which supports what you're trying to do, and a group of players who understand and trust that.<br/><br/>Just like any other game or pursuit!<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434876">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434876/#Comment_434876" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-05T16:24:33+00:00" title="July  5, 2014  4:24PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 5, 2014 4:38PM by Paul_T.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I find it interesting that, even though in a lot of drama (the "comedy" genre, in the ancient sense of the word) the protagonists repeatedly fail until they achieve what they want, in most "story games" the process we've fixated on as a community is, rather, the opposite one:<br/><br/>The protagonists decide what they're going after, and typically are given the ability/tools to achieve that thing. However, the game is structured so that the victory they earn is more costly than they expected.<br/><br/>For example, in <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>, it's pretty darned hard to actually challenge the players: they can win just about any conflict if they are set on doing so. However, the system forces the characters to engage in things they don't want to in order to achieve the victory (typically violence, or the risk of injury/death).<br/><br/>In <i>Apocalypse World</i>, the most typical outcome (a 7-9) gives the protagonist what they were after, but with accompanying complications.<br/><br/>So, rather than being "fail forward", I'd argue that most indie/story games do a sort of "succeed forward": OK, you get what you want, but at what cost? Was it still worth it? You got what you wanted, but you screwed things up in the process. What will you do now?<br/><br/>This is, arguably, the method of <i>tragedy</i> (success with unwanted consequences) rather than <i>comedy</i> (an endless string of complete failures, but ending in success).<br/><br/><br/>(However, in most of these games, including <i>Apocalypse World</i>, this is balanced by character advancement of some sort, so that the character eventually develops the ability to overcome their opposition and have some kind of happy ending. Games in which this does not happen, but actually end in tragedy, like <i>Polaris</i>, are rarer.)<br/><br/>(Escalation, as pointed out above, is also key here. Many games put apparently very powerful "tools" in the hands of the players, like <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>, <i>Sorcerer</i>, <i>Monsterhearts</i>, <i>Poison'd</i>, and <i>Apocalypse World</i>. Then why could these games be considered to be games where "failure" is a common state? Because what they do is give the players/characters the <i>wrong tools for the job</i>. When your goal is to repair a broken relationship, and the tools you have are a gun, a bomb, and the ability to tear out people's throats, the game rewards inappropriate escalation ("You won't help me reconcile with my mother? Then I'll blow up your house!"). This produces its own form of "failure" - once again, the character got what they wanted... but the outcomes are probably not at all what they were hoping for. This is common in Vincent Baker's games, in particular.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434878">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434878/#Comment_434878" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-05T16:53:57+00:00" title="July  5, 2014  4:53PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 5, 2014 4:54PM by AsIf.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree.

(And I don't think anyone here seriously assumes that.)  <br/><br/>As far as narrative mechanics go <i>(metaphor alert)</i>, it's like we're still building adding machines and sliderules using procedural instructions and relying on wise human accountants, but we've had some early visions of computing machines running object-oriented code on neural networks or under AI control.  At this stage, the early object-oriented approaches aren't capable of defining a fully detailed, internally consistent and meaningful artificial reality without a lot of human input, which might make them seem clunkier than sliderule approaches (depending on who's using them).  But again, we still have a long ways to go, in many directions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434879/#Comment_434879" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-05T17:03:09+00:00" title="July  5, 2014  5:03PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 5, 2014 5:04PM by Paul_T.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, yes, indeed!<br/><br/>A lot of drama is all "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tsl7-TJtPew" rel="nofollow">no, but</a>", until the end somewhere.<br/><br/>A lot of story games are mostly "yes, but".

This thread moved. I'll try to hit as many of the questions/comments as I can.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">@IceCreamEmperor</a>. Not quite how Fiasco works. You establish or resolve a scene, and the dice determine if it's a positive or negative resolution. That doesn't necessarily mean you achieve your goal for that scene (to say nothing of your goal for the story). Depending on how the scene is established, a "positive" outcome can be anything from you simply survive up through getting your scene goal. So yes, half the scenes end "positively", but no, half the scenes don't end with you getting your goal.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">@JDCorley</a>. Again, not quite. Yes, Smallville has a lot of good advice for scene framing, and getting in late and leaving early, which is spot on writing advice just as it's spot on scene framing advice. There's a lot of great stuff about setting up conflicts, wedges, pushing at relationships to create drama... it really does a lot well. But there's practically nothing on the episode level of structure. The GM advice is to work up a lot of great conflicts and wedges, reveal what's going on, stay on those conflicts and push them more... and after a few hours of play, round everyone up and hit the climax. And once that's done, hit your tag scenes. Smallville games I've played in or seen often have the "sagging middle" problem. It's not a bad game at all, it's great, I love it, but it goes about halfway to providing proper story structure onto play.<br/><br/>Also, there's a huge difference between "the mechanics don't engage until there's conflict" compared to "the mechanics enforce conflict". You can still have floppy scenes without conflict in Smallville. But you can with any game if things don't fall together right, so that's not inherent to Smallville. Firefly goes a step closer with its scene framing, act structure, and the advice on framing scenes. The complications mechanic is great for that twist and turn within a scene, but by-and-large the characters will still succeed.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Christopher">@Christopher</a> Kubasik. I've played RPGs for something like 30 years, so that would be a really long list.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Asif">@Asif</a>. Well, I'm drawing on my 30+ years of gaming experience for my sample of gamer tendencies. Admittedly, the "must always win" vibe is from the traditional quarter rather than story games the products or story-games the site. Don't take my word for the definition of what good story is, consult the link provided by <a href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">@AccountingForTaste</a> to that David Mamet memo. You'll find nearly identical advice and definitions of what drama is in practically every writing book you pick up (prose, genre, television, film, or comic books). So yes, that is exactly what makes for good stories.<br/><br/>To quote:\n<blockquote>"EVERY SCENE MUST BE DRAMATIC. THAT MEANS: THE MAIN CHARACTER MUST HAVE A SIMPLE, STRAIGHTFORWARD, PRESSING NEED WHICH IMPELS HIM OR HER TO SHOW UP IN THE SCENE.<br/><br/>THIS NEED IS WHY THEY CAME. IT IS WHAT THE SCENE IS ABOUT. THEIR ATTEMPT TO GET THIS NEED MET WILL LEAD, AT THE END OF THE SCENE, TO FAILURE - THIS IS HOW THE SCENE IS OVER. IT, THIS FAILURE, WILL, THEN, OF NECESSITY, PROPEL US INTO THE NEXT SCENE.<br/><br/>ALL THESE ATTEMPTS, TAKEN TOGETHER, WILL, OVER THE COURSE OF THE EPISODE, CONSTITUTE THE PLOT."</blockquote>\nIn short, yes, a character with a goal failing to achieve that goal in various interesting ways till the absolute end of the story, when lo-and-behold, they achieve their goal. If they achieve their goal in the first scene, the "story" is over. It would also be boring and really short. The interesting bits are the scenes in-between with the character failing in interesting ways.<br/><br/>So <a href="/forums/profile/Oren">@Oren</a>, absolutely. Failing through the story till the end where you finally win is utterly vital to good drama. Once the character wins, the drama is let out of the story, they've achieved their goal. That's what's known as the end of the story.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/summerdown">@summerdown</a>, absolutely. Rising action. Escalation. Same, same. The characters are inherently lazy and will try the simplest, easiest means to achieve their goals. Once that proves fruitless, they'll try slightly less easy means, when that fails, slightly less easy means... etc on down to the rousing climax when the wild and absurd action finally gets the character their goal.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a>. I would say that there are a lot of the components present in various games, yes, but only a few with something close to the "total package", like Fiasco or Primetime Adventures. Not that either of them are perfect, but they seem to cover the most ground here. Like Call of Cthulhu. When people play CoC it's more to see how quickly they go insane or what grisly manner their character will die in. But that speaks to your second point: player buy-in.<br/><br/>And what you say here is basically on point: \n<blockquote>I find it interesting that, even though in a lot of drama (the "comedy" genre, in the ancient sense of the word) the protagonists repeatedly fail until they achieve what they want, in most "story games" the process we've fixated on as a community is, rather, the opposite one:<br/><br/>The protagonists decide what they're going after, and typically are given the ability/tools to achieve that thing. However, the game is structured so that the victory they earn is more costly than they expected."</blockquote>\nAnd:\n<blockquote>A lot of drama is all "no, but", until the end somewhere.<br/><br/>A lot of story games are mostly "yes, but".</blockquote>\nExactly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434883">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434883/#Comment_434883" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-05T19:28:05+00:00" title="July  5, 2014  7:28PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 5, 2014 7:30PM by Paul_T.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is interesting. I read Mamet as encouraging writers to skip exposition in favour of action and drama. This is a very good message, of course, and useful to us. <br/><br/>I'm not entirely convinced by his statement that failure is necessary in every scene. After all, in a story game, we don't even always know who the protagonist may be (not having the ability to use hindsight, our knowledge of the ending of the story, to figure it out)!<br/><br/>Can anyone argue conclusively for or against this piece of advice? Perhaps we can look at a dramatic story and see whether each scene includes someone trying to get something and failing.<br/><br/>In any case, I think the RPG medium does offer challenges that writing does not. Two I've brought up are a) sometimes we don't know who the protagonist is ahead of time (or other concerns of plot, theme, etc, which a writer can always edit retroactively - in short, we don't usually know what will happen *next*), and b) the need for interaction between the players (for instance, the Czege Principle) to make a working game. For this perspective, it seems to me that the "yes, but" method is a pretty strong one. I'm not sure I've seen a game which handles "no, but" really well (but I welcome examples!).<br/><br/>Another point:<br/><br/>The games we're talking about almost all derive in some fashion from a group of designers involved with the Forge, or influenced by people who were. One of the central tenets of Ron Edwards' concept of drama and storytelling was that <i>humans are fundamentally and intrinsically story-telling creatures</i>. You can see it in a lot of game designs which leave "story" concerns to a "fruitful void" (leave it to the players' natural inclinations, rather than dictating them via the System).<br/><br/>My experience has been that this has value. I spent about two years working on a story-telling game at one point, and one of my main discoveries was realizing how many parts of "what is drama" I *didn't* need to encode in the game, but could leave to the players' natural instincts.<br/><br/>The basic Forge model was focused on introducing conflicts and then resolving them as the focus for scenes, and letting other elements of story (like the three-act model, concerns of rising action, reincorporation, etc) arise organically. This works really well for some people, and is very gameable. But I have no doubt that other interesting tools and models are on their way (and, indeed, we already have many).<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/liblarva">@liblarva</a>, why do you feel that <i>Fiasco</i> and <i>Primetime Adventures</i> succeed in this respect better than other games? Can you make a list of features?<br/><br/>I'm not sure I agree.

After all, in a story game, we don't even always know who the protagonist may be (not having the ability to use hindsight, our knowledge of the ending of the story, to figure it out)!<br/><br/>Can anyone argue conclusively for or against this piece of advice? Perhaps we can look at a dramatic story and see whether each scene includes someone trying to get something and failing.</blockquote>\nWell, I would say that the simplest solution to the protagonist question is to treat all the PCs as equally the protagonist, or do something akin to PTA/Fiasco where characters have spotlight episodes and/or scenes.<br/><br/>As for the conclusively arguing for anything, I'd suggest that's practically impossible. I've read dozens of writing and drama books and can say that Mamet's advice is nearly universal. I'd offer up most of the movies, novels, TV shows, cartoons, and comics you've consumed in your life as supporting evidence (excluding plotless art house films or experimental pieces), but "definitive" and "conclusive" are essentially hopeless.\n<blockquote>In any case, I think the RPG medium does offer challenges that writing does not. Two I've brought up are a) sometimes we don't know who the protagonist is ahead of time (or other concerns of plot, theme, etc, which a writer can always edit retroactively - in short, we don't usually know what will happen *next*), and b) the need for interaction between the players (for instance, the Czege Principle) to make a working game. For this perspective, it seems to me that the "yes, but" method is a pretty strong one. I'm not sure I've seen a game which handles "no, but" really well (but I welcome examples!).</blockquote>\nI've addressed the "who's the protagonist" question above. Plot isn't necessary to know with certainty ahead of time. As per that Mamet quote, the sum total of the scenes involving the character in pursuit of that goal <i>is</i> the plot. So too with theme. The GM or players can decide "we're going to hit these kinds of things tonight" or an example from Smallville, Watchtower decides to hit a few of the PCs' relationships, or designs a Values episode and hits those. When similar things come up several times in play--either by design, or organically--that's what I would call theme. \n<blockquote>The basic Forge model was focused on introducing conflicts and then resolving them as the focus for scenes, and letting other elements of story (like the three-act model, concerns of rising action, reincorporation, etc) arise organically. This works really well for some people, and is very gameable. But I have no doubt that other interesting tools and models are on their way (and, indeed, we already have many).<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/liblarva">@liblarva</a>, why do you feel that <i>Fiasco</i> and <i>Primetime Adventures</i> succeed in this respect better than other games? Can you make a list of features?</blockquote>\nParadoxically, that the story structure <i>isn't</i> left to a nebulous, organic, we're natural story-tellers style of design. PTA has explicit TV structure, teaser, four acts, and tag. Spotlight episodes. Explicit scenes need conflict style design. A lot of that overlaps with Fiasco, the explicit act structure, the rotating spotlight scenes, the tilt and aftermath (cliffhanger and denouement respectively).\n<blockquote>I'm not sure I agree. For instance, in <i>Fiasco</i>, as many people have experienced, it's VERY easy to have scenes which do not in the least satisfy Mamet's injunctions.</blockquote>\nI would offer that most who play Fiasco aren't professional screenwriters. See the TableTop video of Fiasco. It evolved and resolved very much like a classically structured story.\n<blockquote>And, in any case, it's always an interesting question to say just how strongly a game should lead us through the story. When I was designing my story-telling games, one of my friends wanted to take one of those "story models" (acts broken down into beats, archetypal plots, etc) and make what boils down a form to fill out, one step at a time: "Ok, we're at scene 12, where the hero receives an unexpected visitor. How will this happen in our story?"</blockquote>\nThat would be too much for me as well. But some combination of PTA's teaser, tag, plus four acts and Fiasco's act ending twist would probably be enough on a meta-level.\n<blockquote>That seemed to me to reduce the story to such a predictable formula that I would lose interest in playing it out: there are few surprises that way.</blockquote>\nWell, that's the basic structure of nearly all prose, film, television, comics, etc. yet it's still varied enough to produce all that engaging fiction. Outside of Game of Thrones, do you really wonder if the main characters will ultimately succeed or fail? Whether they'll live or die? You know the good guy will win, the bad guy will lose, but yet, we all still consume the fiction. The interesting parts are the twists and turns the story takes between the beginning and end. \n<blockquote>(And, as I pointed out earlier, I'm not so sure that Mamet's model even covers stories like tragedies (or other forms of storytelling, like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kish%C5%8Dtenketsu" rel="nofollow">kishotenketsu</a>.)</blockquote>\nThe difference between drama (aka classic definition of comedy) and tragedy is the ending. In drama the end is up, the character(s) wins. In tragedy the end is down, the character(s) lose, or die.<br/><br/>I don't know kishotenketsu so cannot comment on it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434886">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/biffboff" title="biffboff"><img alt="biffboff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/189/nI5NYQDMCBCPG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/biffboff">biffboff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434886/#Comment_434886" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-05T21:30:07+00:00" title="July  5, 2014  9:30PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, I'm just going to state the obvious: a "story game" is a first draft of a story. Unless you are Michael Moorecock back in the 70's, your first draft is probably going to suck.<br/><br/>You may have well-defined characters and villains; an evocative setting; themes; etc. but if you assume that an interesting, cohesive story is going to result from die rolls right out of the gate, then you must adhere to the OSR notion that "story" is what happens after the game.  "Remember that time when..."<br/><br/>Anyone who writes a story has an idea, an inkling, where it is going to go. The Ring-bearer will refuse to throw the Ring into the Fire but we know the Ring <i>will</i> go into the fire. "How?", is the question. If I was Sam, I'd have tackled Frodo and sent us both in. Didn't see that coming. But I love the exploration, the unknown, the surprises in RPGs; that's my kick. <br/><br/>One way would be to define the story as you are defining the characters and setting. A first draft before you play. A Prophecy stage, if you will. If every character is the hero of their story, give each character a story arc;  three ('cuz I like three) seemingly impossible things that MUST happen for the story/adventure to conclude. Such as:<br/><br/>Your hero is the villain (the Dread Pirate Roberts)<br/>Your hero dies (enter Miracle Max)<br/>Your hero wins a duel without lifting a finger (To the Pain!)<br/><br/>Admittedly, this would require that everyone collaborate imaginatively to ensure that the story meets these criteria satisfactorily. Some would prefer that the dice do the work; or the GM. Different strokes. <br/><br/>-"Hold it! Hold it! Grand-pa, you read that wrong. She doesn't marry Humperdinck. She marries Westley. I'm just sure of it. After all he did for her, if she didn't marry him, it wouldn't be fair."  <br/>-"Well who says life is fair? Where is that written? Life isn't always fair."<br/>-"Who gets Humperdinck?" <br/>-"I don't understand."<br/>-"Who kills Prince Humperdinck? At the end, somebody's got to do it! Is it Inigo? Who?" <br/>-"Nobody. Nobody kills him. He lives."<br/>-"You mean he wins? Jesus, grand-pa, why did you read me this thing for?" <br/>-"You know, you've been very sick, and you're taking this story very seriously. I think we'd better stop now."<br/>-"No, I'm ok. I'm ok. Sit down. I'm all right."                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434887/#Comment_434887" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-05T21:52:16+00:00" title="July  5, 2014  9:52PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 5, 2014 10:15PM by AsIf.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah.

What about this: Some scenes do nothing but bring new information into existence.  (e.g. "There's a new guy who's opened a trading post on the edge of town.  He's mysterious and says he knows you from years ago." or "According to this report, someone has been embezzling from the company for over six months - but we don't know who it was, nor what the funds were diverted for.")  <br/><br/>These scenes are functional "set-ups" for later scenes in which that information is used (or destroyed, or falls into the wrong hands, or turns out to be incorrect, etc).  Could turn out good, could turn out bad.  Sometimes the writers don't even know which it is when they write it; they will figure that out later.  (NOTE: A good GM leaves loose ends like this lying around all the time.)  Since at the moment the information is introduced we do not know how the later scene will play out, it's impossible at that point to tell whether it represents a step forward or a step back for the protagonists.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434888">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434888/#Comment_434888" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-05T21:57:29+00:00" title="July  5, 2014  9:57PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's brilliant, <a href="/forums/profile/biffboff">@biffboff</a> !!<br/><br/>I have very little patience for people who are *always* in "must win" mode and indeed they do exist. But by the same token, I think there is something to the notion that a game needs to have a sense of forward momentum. Many OSR games actually don't.

It might only be tangental for some. Here's a quote:\n<blockquote><i>I was running a game of Sorcerer and after the first session one of the players commented that she didn\u2019t like how much the die system redefined her character.  When I asked for clarification it turned out that there had been certain key moments where she had failed a die roll and in those moments her character concept had been redefined because the character she wanted to play \u201cwould have\u201d succeeded at those things.  She had failed in those moments and her actual idea of who the character was had been altered.<br/><br/>The key to avoiding this disappointment is to shift focus away from thinking about what the character is supposed to accomplish and start thinking about the character in terms of what crisis he is confronting.  When a player invests in the character\u2019s crisis the paths to satisfaction become less confined.  If my character is defined by his struggle with his religion then any set of events and resolutions which speak to that struggle will be satisfactory.  Maybe he drives his family away with his zealousness.  Maybe he abandons it all together.  Maybe he learns to keep it quiet so he can co-exist with his best friend.  What happens almost doesn\u2019t matter because what the player and the group care about is the character\u2019s struggle with his religion.</i></blockquote>\nBut read the whole thing.

These are two different things, and operate differently.<br/><br/>ETA: Meanwhile, all of the speculation so far limits itself to considering structures that break stories up (or put them together) as discrete chunks of one-way linear time and imagine that the only way to generate a story is through the point of view of a character moving through a series of segments along this line.

But identical advice exists for novelists, it's referred to as Scene and Sequel. Many novelists are explicit that they write in this fashion, one example being Jim Butcher. In <a href="http://jimbutcher.livejournal.com/2647.html" rel="nofollow">this blog post he talks about Scenes</a> in nearly identical terms as Mamet, including the scene goal, conflict, and the failure (though Butcher refers to it as a setback).<br/><br/>To quote Butcher, "The result of the conflict is *always* a SETBACK of one kind or another (also thought of as the SCENE ANSWER)--at least, until you get to the end of the book." Later when providing details on the setback he says, "(In fact, I often don't even like to use the word "setback" to describe the results of the scene. I like referring to it as the DISASTER. But I'm melodramatic, that way.)"<br/><br/><a href="http://jimbutcher.livejournal.com/2880.html" rel="nofollow">Butcher describes Sequels here</a>. He also does a <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=video&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CCIQtwIwAQ&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DoiKmP-tL4vo&amp;ei=seK4U8zKA8WCogSDv4LoBw&amp;usg=AFQjCNFaHrMby27fqz97ocexOaXLO_mL_g&amp;bvm=bv.70138588,d.cGU" rel="nofollow">much longer talk on the subject here</a>.\n<blockquote>* The failure in scenes thing: John McClain wants to be back in bed with his estranged wife. That's the need Mamet would be referring to with the "simple, pressing, need." He starts the movie that way. That's his need for the rest of DIE HARD. About a third of the way through DIE HARD he kills a terrorist, gets his gun. He "wins" the scene. However, is he in bed with his wife? Nope. He has failed to pull that off. The next scene occurs, per Mamet's instructions. Don't assume that every success or failure is working only at the macro level of the scene itself.</blockquote>\nDie Hard is a great example. I'll lend some context to that scene. Just before that John watches Hans execute Mr. Takagi. John freaks and runs. He comes to an empty part of the building and talks to himself, deciding what to do. He looks up, sees the sprinkler system and fire alarm, and decides what to do (setting his goal of bringing the authorities). The terrorists smoothly handle the problem and send a goon with a gun up to the 32nd floor to check it out. John watches the approaching firetrucks and cars with delight, which quickly turns to anger as they turn off their lights and slow down, ("no, and...") the elevator bell dings and the terrorist is on the same floor looking for John.<br/><br/>Now John is locked in a life or death struggle with the terrorist, he's fairly adamant that he'd like to live through this encounter so John's non-overarching plot goal here is to survive. John fights with the guy, they slide down the stairs and the terrorist snaps his neck, dying instantly. So John survives ("yes, but...") the dead guy is Hans' second-in-command's brother. Which sets up a great revenge subplot that goes throughout the film.\n<blockquote>Jesse Burneko wrote a post at his PLAY PASSIONATELY site which might be <a href="http://playpassionately.wordpress.com/2010/05/25/play-passionately-state-of-the-union/" rel="nofollow">pertinent</a>.

Taking the focus away from how strong someone is physically, or whether they can pick a lock, instead you dig into the character and the story comes from there. For example, Smallville. Characters are largely defined by their Values and Relationships, sure things like super-strength and super-speed are there, but those traits are only rolled some times. The GM is straight-up told to hit characters' relationships and values for stories.<br/><br/>And thanks for the link, I hadn't seen that article before.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/summerdown" title="summerdown"><img alt="summerdown" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/summerdown">summerdown</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434899/#Comment_434899" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-06T00:35:06+00:00" title="July  6, 2014 12:35AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 6, 2014 12:39AM by summerdown.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Anyone who writes a story has an idea, an inkling, where it is going to go.  </blockquote>\nThis isn't the case in my experience. There seem to be two styles of writer, which taken to the extreme are: those who plot everything out in advance, and those who start with an initial situation and make everything up as they go along. Every time I've tried to plot out my stories they've failed miserably, for example.<br/><br/>I think the same is true of RPGs. You get "Story Before," the classic preplotted module in Cthulhu, or advice in Heroquest that tells you to make it easier on the players at certain times to simulate a story. This is writing from the outside, like a mapmaker drawing a map.<br/><br/>Then you get "Story Now," where a situation is drawn up, and each week the GM works out how the NPCs react to what's just happened. This is writing from the inside, like a car driving along a road and only seeing what the headlights reveal.<br/><br/>I think the RPG community is pretty well served by pre-plotted modules. What's interesting is whether it's possible to have \n<ol><li>a situation pregnant enough to guarantee a story</li>\n<li>combined with mechanics that create failure</li>\n<li>and other mechanics that create escalation</li>\n<li> all happening organically in the course of play.</li>\n</ol>\nAs far as I can see, a lot of work has gone into 1) (eg sorcerer), a bit into 2) (eg apocalypse world), but not much into failure at the macro-level, and very little into escalation.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434910">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tore_V" title="Tore_V"><img alt="Tore_V" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tore_V">Tore_V</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434910/#Comment_434910" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-06T13:29:15+00:00" title="July  6, 2014  1:29PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Summerdown">@Summerdown</a><br/>In my regular campaign of Monsterhearts I, as gm, don't even make up fronts.

We're a niche in a niche.  We tend to be well-read and/or cinema-philes.  Many of us are into acting or performing, either professionally or just for kicks.  Our interests and experiences have trained us in ways we often don't think about; Whether we realize it or not, we are <i>specialists</i>.  This specialty is the result of years of training and thinking on subjects most people don't spend much time on, and it's something we take for granted and tend to over-assume in others.<br/><br/>I agree that all humans have an ingrained sense of narrative structure - that's why we say things like "the story of my life".  <br/><br/>But to be able to willfully call up that sensibility and access it in a pro-active way that's both meaningful and collaborative?  That's a <i>talent</i> that can be trained.  Like all talents it can be viewed as producing a broad spectrum of performance quality.  Like all talents, some are born with a lot of it, and yet we can all train ourselves to do better at it.

Or am I missing something?</blockquote>\nNo, you didn't miss anything, however we're still collectively missing a piece of things, namely "no, and" in a lot of ways.<br/><br/>As you said yourself:\n<blockquote>A lot of drama is all "no, but", until the end somewhere.<br/><br/>A lot of story games are mostly "yes, but".</blockquote>\nSo of the two dominant resolutions to dramatic scenes we have one that's fairly well represented and one that isn't as much. Which leads back to a question in my OP, "I know there are quite a few games that have versions of "fail forward" and "succeed at cost" mechanics, they're really popular in the last few years, but are there any games that rely almost exclusively on those? And as a gamer, would you get frustrated with that setup?" With the added experience of the thread, that comes down to the question: Would "yes, but" along with "no, and" be enough to keep you* as a gamer engaged throughout a session of play?<br/><br/>* General you, rather than specific you.<br/><br/>Comparing "yes, but" to "no, and" it's interesting that either way, something bad is going to happen. Your option is binary, you either succeed or fail at the scene goal at hand, however, no matter what, something bad is going to happen as a result of your actions. And generally speaking, that "something bad" is going to dominate the next scene.<br/><br/>There's also something that seems to have been somewhat lost in the conversation, the distinction between task resolution and scene resolution. While a character may succeed at a simple task that's one step among several to achieve their scene goal, ultimately something bad is going to happen at the end of the scene that propels the story into the next. So if your scene goal is to crack the safe and you have several tasks related to that goal (say breaking into the building, getting into the office, then actually cracking the safe) then you could certainly succeed on those steps leading to the scene goal, but by and large the result of the scene will be negative. Either you crack the safe ("yes, but") the alarm goes off; or you accidentally trip the deadlock ("no, and furthermore") you create so much noise the guards come running.<br/><br/>There's also the distinction made by several posters between the micro and macro goals. Your overarching macro goal won't be accomplished till the end of the story, but some micro goals might be, though there will always be a cost ("yes, but"). If you want to really go wild, there are task questions, scene questions, act questions, and an overarching story question.\n<blockquote>But to be able to willfully call up that sensibility and access it in a pro-active way that's both meaningful and collaborative?

And that's all we're talking about here, a few pieces of drama each over the course of a session. Like with Fiasco and PTA, you're dividing the workload between the players present. All you've got to come up with really is a few engaging scenes for your own character in the milieu of the setting. And honestly that's what the structure is there for, to break down a big question into smaller, more manageable pieces.<br/><br/>Take the one-hour TV drama structure:<br/><br/>Teaser: action, inciting incident.<br/>Act One: confusion, determination to figure out what's going on.<br/>Act Two: conflict between the characters and whatever stands in their way.<br/>Act Three: despair, the low point of the story, all seems lost.<br/>Act Four: redemption, the characters rally and start to overcome their obstacles.<br/>Tag: reflection, coming to grips with the story that has just unfolded.<br/><br/>It takes the dreaded "what's the story" question and turns it into six pieces. The teaser kicks off the story, the tag wraps up the story, so that leaves the acts. Each act has fairly obvious distinctions between its neighbors, and reacting to a situation presented by the GM will typically have some fairly obvious responses and necessary first steps.<br/><br/>Take PTA as an example. The Producer has an idea for a general story, something that's pregnant with possibility and presents it to the players as the teaser. Say a murder for the police procedural game they're playing.<br/><br/>Every act each player gets one spotlight scene. It's got to be dramatic, the spotlight character must have a goal, they will struggle with their opposition in whatever form it takes, and ultimately they will face a setback ("no, and" or "yes, but").<br/><br/>In act one the PCs are doing the initial investigation of the crime. They're confused but determined to do what they can. You're playing a detective and one of the first questions you'd likely ask is "Did anyone see the crime" or "Who found the body". That's a scene. You've got a character (your PC), in a location (the crime scene), with a goal ("Did anyone..." or "Who found..."). Your opposition would be the witnesses or the person who found the corpse. You try to get information out of them and you have a rough time of it, but whether you get any information (yes or no) you're going to suffer a setback of some kind, such as the witness is a drunk, or the guy who found the body was committing a crime. Cool. That's one scene down. Who's next. Now you as a player get to spend the rest of the act thinking of a good question or goal for your character's next scene.<br/><br/>Scene goals are ultimately simple questions, it's the answers that complicate things. Coming up with a few questions that suit the act you're in over the course of an evening's play isn't that hard. Each player asks one or two questions per act, play through those till you get through the acts, tag that puppy, and suddenly you've got a game session that's played like a one-hour TV drama. Sure, as mentioned above, it's likely a first draft version of a story, but it's still an actual story with drama in roughly the right shape for an engaging story in-and-of-itself.<br/><br/>And ultimately that's what I'm talking about. Games designed to explicitly produce something adjacent to proper story structure through play. It doesn't need to be polished, perfect, or a best seller, but it should contain all those necessary elements. Dramatic scenes, cliffhangers, rising action, climax, denouement, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434916">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434916/#Comment_434916" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-06T19:35:14+00:00" title="July  6, 2014  7:35PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Liblarva,<br/><br/>I'm going to make a stab at a few questions again.<br/><br/>1) Are you familiar with the distinction between Conflict Resolution and Conflict Resolution?

Try looking at that. Also, if you can find a copy of Michael Miller's _With Great Power_, it models the sort of super-hero story in which the protagonists can only succeed after they fail, and suffer, and maybe even almost lose. It's worth it to play _WGP_ if your group has issues with hating to lose, since ironically the way to *win* is to fail early and often in order to gain the resources you need to pull out a win against the bad guy. However, a good GM will make those early losses _really painful_ by threatening the things your character holds dear--or even worse, the things you hold dear about your character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434918/#Comment_434918" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-06T21:06:04+00:00" title="July  6, 2014  9:06PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm surprised no one's taken up my suggestion that "yes, but" may be a more fruitful gamer technology, because it involves a more interactive process.

Something else to consider is that as that dreaded "G" word, many are reluctant to fail. It is a possibility.<br/><br/>As pointed out yourself, despite fiction mostly being filled with "no, and furthermore" scene resolutions, most story games are "yes, but". So while it is one of the two scene resolutions that dominate fiction, as g... people who play games, and as designers of games, the community has largely embraced one while largely ignoring the other.<br/><br/>And yes, there are many varieties of gamers. Granted. As I said above, in my experience traditional gamers detest losing. That's not all gamers. Again, story games and story gamers are different.

But then I know this community - and the people I play with - are perhaps an unusual group.<br/><br/>I've even seen games fail because the players weren't trying to "win" enough. There have been numerous articles written on this: "At least TRY to make your character win something, gosh darn it! Otherwise the game's design doesn't work!

That's a strong reason to bias games towards "yes, but".

Also, if you can find a copy of Michael Miller's _With Great Power_, it models the sort of super-hero story in which the protagonists can only succeed after they fail, and suffer, and maybe even almost lose. It's worth it to play _WGP_ if your group has issues with hating to lose, since ironically the way to *win* is to fail early and often in order to gain the resources you need to pull out a win against the bad guy. However, a good GM will make those early losses _really painful_ by threatening the things your character holds dear--or even worse, the things you hold dear about your character.</blockquote>\nI have.

Another is the assumption of forward-moving, time-bound subjective POV characters and your overly-homogenous definition of the word "gamers", leaving out fiction-generating constructs and playstyles coming from different stances (perhaps involving no roleplayed characters at all).  It is only when accepting assumptions like these that the tension you allude to seems to appear.  But it only *seems*.<br/><br/>You say the word "storygames" (for which there is no one single definition, stance, model, approach or objective) and you focus on the emulation of traditional fiction (without specifying whether we're talking about reading/viewing it or writing/filming it - which are actually very different acts).  This makes your distinction blurry to begin with.  But if you draw your counter-examples from traditional roleplaying games, you have to recognize that trad RPGs generally <i>don't even intend</i> to emulate the well-defined fictional constructs of literature and film, but rather <i>Real Life</i>(TM), with all its unforeseen emergence, cross-purposes, lost causes, dead ends, and messy up-and-down-ness.  Not to mention all that stuff about counting the number of acts.  IRL the number of acts just keeps increasing, and the "plot" is only seen in hindsight, cherry-picked from a mass of mostly-irrelevant data called "everything that happened".<br/><br/>But it's nice to hear you speaking constructively rather than categorically:-)  Keep doing that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434926">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/liblarva" title="liblarva"><img alt="liblarva" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/liblarva">liblarva</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434926/#Comment_434926" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-07T00:32:00+00:00" title="July  7, 2014 12:32AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>But if you draw your counter-examples from traditional roleplaying games, you have to recognize that trad RPGs generally <i>don't even intend</i> to emulate the well-defined fictional constructs of literature and film, but rather <i>Real Life</i>(TM), with all its unforeseen emergence, cross-purposes, lost causes, dead ends, and messy up-and-down-ness.</blockquote>\nI can honestly say that's the first time I've ever seen anyone claim that RPGs in any way emulate real life.

I really don't get your resistance to me sharing my experience with traditional gamers.<br/></blockquote>\nAh, well, my apologies. I read your original post as speaking about "all gamers", or at least "most gamers", especially when you were explaining how stories and games are fundamentally about different things (which implies that you're speaking about all games and all gamers).<br/><br/>It makes more sense in the light of a more constrained topic.<br/><br/>However, having said that, I *still* find that the majority of gamers I've met in my life don't fit this description. I've definitely run into some gamers who are all about "winning", but I think they're a minority group (in my experience). I've seen them either:<br/><br/>a) Try some games which aren't based on winning and losing, not enjoy themselves, and stop playing those games.<br/><br/>or<br/><br/>b) Struggle with the issue for a session or two, and then understand they're finally playing in a context where winning and losing <i>isn't where the fun is</i> and get fully on board with "failing forward", "playing to lose", and all that jazz.<br/><br/>I've run into one or two people who can't handle this constructively, but they're very rare, in my experience. That's why I can't relate to your thesis here.<br/><br/><br/>Now this part, to me, as a game designer, is much more interesting:\n<blockquote><br/>Only if you assume that one player gets to decide the entirety of the outcome, both the yes/no axis and the but/and axis. You don't have to place that control with the same player. You could just as easily give the yes/no axis to the winning player and the but/and axis to the losing player.

In that spirit, let me criticize this idea for a moment, and see if we can get something good out of this.<br/><br/>First of all, what do you mean by "the kicker"? Can you explain what you mean? Are you talking about narration rights?<br/><br/>Having said that:<br/><br/>a) I'm not sure I've actually seen a game which does this well. I've seen games like Trollbabe, where the loser of the conflict wins narration rights, and these work pretty well for the most part. I don't see (at least in practice) how this deals with the "no, and"/"failure in every scene" concept, however. Let's say we have the winner narrate the outcome but the loser decide whether the outcome is yes or no. Is that somehow superior to the kind of resolution we have now? How so?<br/><br/>I'm not 100% sure, in other words, how this interacts with the issue of a Mamet-esque fictional approach.<br/><br/>b) As Butcher writes, the key to story is conflict, and, specifically, conflict between active *tagonists. Story emerges from their clash of ideas, and the actions they take to get what they want.<br/><br/>In this context, it's very helpful to allow different parties to fight for their goals: we get this very organically by putting different players in charge of different characters and then giving them tools to challenge each other.<br/><br/>If we use a model where "no" is the default resolution for anything you try to do, how do we create this kind of tension?<br/><br/>I've definitely seen games like <i>With Great Power</i>, where you must lose a certain number of conflicts in order to get the ability to win the ones you actually care about. But even this seems to function better with "yes, but" or "no, but" outcomes. As even Butcher writes himself, the "no, and" or "no" outcomes should be used sparingly (even in fiction!) or it can quickly get very frustrating.<br/><br/>I'd love to discuss this further, though.<br/><br/>Story games in general experienced quite a revival when the idea of "sequels" was first tackled by designers. This could be another such fruitful thing.<br/><br/><br/>Aside:<br/><br/>Tod (AsIf) makes a great point about your focus on "games" being very focused on GM-led traditional RPGs with character monogamy. How do you even apply this logic to other games (or even the GM's role in a traditional RPG)?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/liblarva" title="liblarva"><img alt="liblarva" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/liblarva">liblarva</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434946/#Comment_434946" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-07T12:43:45+00:00" title="July  7, 2014 12:43PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 7, 2014 1:46PM by liblarva.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Now this part, to me, as a game designer, is much more interesting:<br/><br/>First of all, what do you mean by "the kicker"?

How so?</blockquote>\nIf your goal in designing the game is to more closely emulate the way fiction actually operates, then the closer you get to the way fiction actually operates the better. Whether that makes for a fun gaming experience and why or why not is a separate though important question. If the answer is "No, that's not fun" I would submit that the reason why not is that deep need to win.<br/><br/>If we focus on the Butcher advice, and use this quote from Mamet ("START, EVERY TIME, WITH THIS INVIOLABLE RULE: THE SCENE MUST BE DRAMATIC. it must start because the hero HAS A PROBLEM, AND IT MUST CULMINATE WITH THE HERO FINDING HIM OR HERSELF EITHER THWARTED OR EDUCATED THAT ANOTHER WAY EXISTS.") and define that "failure" as that extra piece of bad news (the "and/but") then we can avoid the problem of "every scene must be a failure", which would lead us squarely back to "yes, but" along with "no, and". \n<blockquote>b) As Butcher writes, the key to story is conflict, and, specifically, conflict between active *tagonists. Story emerges from their clash of ideas, and the actions they take to get what they want.<br/><br/>In this context, it's very helpful to allow different parties to fight for their goals: we get this very organically by putting different players in charge of different characters and then giving them tools to challenge each other.</blockquote>\nIt sounds as if your default assumption is GM-less play combined with strict PvP. I see no reason to make that assumption.\n<blockquote>If we use a model where "no" is the default resolution for anything you try to do, how do we create this kind of tension?</blockquote>\nA simple "no" will not create tension any more than a simple "yes" will, it's the extra bit, the "things get worse"/"failure" that creates the tension and drives the story. That's the interesting bit, seeing how things get worse for the characters, seeing what adversity they have to overcome, rather than watch as they emerge unscathed at the end.<br/><br/>Again, Die Hard is a great example. Tension with his wife, no shoes, on the run, hunted by terrorists, getting grief from the deputy police chief on the outside, Hans murdering Ellis and the cops outside thinking he could have saved him, having to choose between death and running across broken glass, Hans finding out Holly is John's wife, being shot, dodging explosions, Hans holding a gun to his wife's head, Hans trying to drag Holly out the skyscraper window... that's the interesting and engaging stuff of that movie. What happens next and how's he going to get out of it. By comparison, John sliding down the stairs and breaking Tony's neck is boring. It's the consequences of that action (the brother's revenge subplot) that's the interesting piece of that scene.\n<blockquote>As even Butcher writes himself, the "no, and" or "no" outcomes should be used sparingly (even in fiction!) or it can quickly get very frustrating.</blockquote>\nYou might have misread his advice then. Though he does say simple "no" should be used with caution, he says "no, and" is hands-down the single most interesting and useful resolution of any given scene as it creates the most fun experience. Why? Because not only does is make things worse for the character (the "and furthermore" piece), it puts a roadblock in the character's way. Either entirely closing off that line of action, or forcing the character to try again in a different, more inventive way.<br/><br/>To quote Butcher:\n<blockquote>ANSWER 4: NO! AND FURTHERMORE! My personal favorite scene answer. Not only does your hero NOT attain his goal, but he manages to make matters even WORSE along the way. It's best if the worsening of the situation is your protagonist's fault, because that's just FUN, but it doesn't necessarily have to be.<br/><br/>THIS answer is really the one that gives you the most interesting scenes, provides the meat for the most interesting and endearing sequels, and is generally the Big Gun you pull out when your plot is slowing down. Warning: it does force you, as the writer, to get a little creative, because it multiplies the problems your hero has to solve. But hey. If you weren't at least a little creative, you wouldn't be here.</blockquote>\nThis is where part of that tension between story expectations and gaming expectations comes in. In fiction the idea is to pound the character as hard as possible, make their lives suck as much as possible, hammer hammer hammer them into a tiny little corner, and when they've had enough and are on the verge of breaking... you hammer them some more. Once you've pushed them so far beyond what they thought was their limit, only then do they get to start kicking ass. They come back from what seemed impossible at the start of the story and eventually win, though of course it can't be easy. That's the default assumption of fiction, that the characters will get their asses handed to them for 3/4 of the story before they turn things around.<br/><br/>In my experience with traditional gamers (and granted, I could simply be extremely unlucky in that every single trad gamer I've ever encountered in 30+ years of gaming with various groups, at local and national cons is a fluke), the assumption is exactly the opposite. They are trained to plan for everything, make sure they leave as little to chance as possible, take minimal risk for maximum reward, and generally come through as near to unharmed and unscratched as possible. Yes, story gamers are not like this, but as we've seen the default for most story games is still on the spectrum of "yes" (including simple yes's which are utterly boring fictionally), and such ingrained resistance to the idea that the default of fiction really is something bad continuously befalling the characters that many simply reject it out of hand or argue endlessly.\n<blockquote>Story games in general experienced quite a revival when the idea of "sequels" was first tackled by designers. This could be another such fruitful thing.</blockquote>\nI don't know about all that, I was just looking for some games that worked like actual fiction. But, hey, if I have to wait a year or two for some of the big brains to whip something up, I'll still pick it up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434948">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434948/#Comment_434948" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-07T12:48:21+00:00" title="July  7, 2014 12:48PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 7, 2014 1:32PM by AsIf.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>(I do think that saying that games emulate "real life" is equally bizarre as a general statement, but certainly a good number *try* pretty hard.)</blockquote>Yep.  Note the verb in my sentence was actually "<i>intend</i>  to emulate" not "emulate".  And if it's not clear, I mean "real life in the game world" not "real life in the real world".  In other words: If something happens, it happens because of the internal logic of the simulation, not because of any thematic concerns or the intention of 'winning'.<br/><br/>To lean back on the GNS model, this idea of Simulationist play falls in line with "Purist" aesthetics and Ron Edwards' definitions of S as opposed to G and N, for example: "Simulationism heightens and focuses Exploration as the priority of play. The players may be greatly concerned with the internal logic and experiential consistency of that Exploration" or "Simulationist play may be spoken of as lacking metagame, like "winning" or "doing well" in Gamism, or addressing a Premise in Narrativism."  It may be rather oldschool, but then so is this argument.<br/><br/>Interestingly, Jack Spencer proposed the word "Emulation" as a replacement for "Simulationism".<br/><br/>Back to you Bob!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434951">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434951/#Comment_434951" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-07T13:17:43+00:00" title="July  7, 2014  1:17PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>So it seems that what makes for good stories and good gaming are polar opposites</blockquote>\nI like this observation and this one to \n<blockquote>One of the tensions I've come across when dealing with games and gamers is the expectation to win</blockquote>\nI give you credit for saying in plain terms liblarva.<br/><br/>I have fallen under the spell of these tensions and seen others indulge in them.  <br/><br/>You have to agree on some level Liblarva observations are good.<br/><br/>liblarva. said<blockquote>For me it seems to come back to that again and again, more closely mirroring the fiction in structure and form.

That is, the stories are told through the actions and words of the characters in conflict of some sort. This is opposed to, say, novels, which are told narratively -- that is, a telling of a tale through narration (description, and so forth). That is, in the script of the play, there is only what the characters say in their interactions with each other. The conflicts between the characters is the story. A screenplay adds more visual detail (it's a visual medium) but it still rides on the conflicts between the characters to tell the tale. The tale is created and told through these conflicting agendas.<br/><br/>Mamet is a basic "go to" for instruction on this, as far as I'm concerned. <br/><br/>I'm not as familiar with Butcher's carpenter tools as Mamet's -- though I'm becoming more familiar with them now.

I mean, I have no actual numbers, but I'm more than willing to believe it's the vast majority. It's a fun way to play -- but it doesn't arc toward fiction as you and I think of fiction. I would point out that before 1999 most games and game play were explicitly as you describe.<br/><br/>All I'm trying to do is point out: a) there are plenty of games that handle the kind of play you like; b) there are players who want to play absolutely contrary to the players you have played with. The number of players...? I have no idea. I know I'll be starting a game of <i>Sorcerer &amp; Sword</i> with some of them this Wed. night. They are out there.<br/><br/>When you write:<br/><br/><i>In fiction the idea is to pound the character as hard as possible, make their lives suck as much as possible, hammer hammer hammer them into a tiny little corner, and when they've had enough and are on the verge of breaking... you hammer them some more.</i><br/><br/>... all I can say is, "That's how I GM." And my friends like it. And when my friends Jesse or Colin GM and I'm playing, that's what I like.<br/><br/>In the game <i>Sorcerer</i>, the rules explicitly have a GM tool called Bangs. As in, a hammer banging a nail. As in, the GM is supposed to "pound the character as hard as possible."<br/><br/>Here's one more quote from the annotations of Sorcerer:\n<blockquote><b>Closing Words</b><br/>The back cover says, \u201cYou\u2019ve never seen role-playing like this before.\u201d A lot of features of the game justify this claim, and all of them are built from the following three interconnected principles. Plot cannot be prepped. Just forget that whole idea. This is about making stories in a genuinely emergent and creative way, not about one person delivering them, nor even about one person improvising them on the spot. And most importantly, play does not guarantee them. You only get a story from Sorcerer if it\u2019s something you and everyone else absolutely fanatically want to do.<br/><br/>You can\u2019t game the universe. There are no break points to exploit, no funky modifiers to stack, no optimal builds. There are plenty of tactics, yes, but strategy, no. Your character will only and ever merely have a shot at getting what he or she wants. Take your shot. You can\u2019t lock down its success before that.<br/><br/>Nothing is sacred. There is no safety net anywhere, a principle which is manifested in several ways.<br/><br/>* First, your character\u2019s life. It\u2019s not easy or quick in this game, most of the time, but your character can die. And less fatally but perhaps<br/>more traumatically, nothing in this game is built to ensure that your character succeeds in their goals and dreams.<br/><br/>* Second, your character\u2019s value. The game does not afford you the privilege of playing a protagonist. In fact, it even encourages you to flirt with the possibility of what some call the \u201cmoral event horizon,\u201d in the form of the Humanity mechanic. If you want to play a real protagonist, someone anyone cares a bit about, then you must earn it.<br/><br/>* Third, the quality of the emergent story. The game encourages your inspiration and creates a means for it to appear as imagery and events. It leaves open the question of whether you have any inspiration worth doing that with.<br/><br/>I\u2019ve explained this at demonstrations and conventions before. Some people light up with enthusiasm and start asking eager questions.<br/><br/>No lie: others turn pale and run.</blockquote>\nOne of the reasons I keep bringing up <i>Sorcerer </i>is because, frankly, the game is from a decade and a half ago but most people simply have no understanding of how radical it is as a game -- even now. Ron wrote, "Okay, we can make games that are like stories!" And everyone goes, "Cool!" And they try to build in all these pacing mechanics and whatnot, and things that make them look like stories. But most people dodge the very qualities I quoted from you in this post. That's the shit that makes an RPG a story. Sorcerer does it. Other games I've mentioned does it.<br/><br/>The games exist <i>right now</i>. <br/><br/>[Edited to fix formatting from the <i>Annotated Sorcerer</i> quote.]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/liblarva" title="liblarva"><img alt="liblarva" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/liblarva">liblarva</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434956/#Comment_434956" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-07T15:16:55+00:00" title="July  7, 2014  3:16PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 7, 2014 3:36PM by liblarva.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Christopher_Kubasik">@Christopher_Kubasik</a>.

It's not that I'm a frustrated trad gamer who just discovered story games last week and is asking for recs, I'm a long-time trad gamer who's played story games for years, and in that time I haven't found a single game that meets more than a few of what I'm learning are my criteria for a great story game. The problem isn't that I can't find <i>any</i> games that meet <i>any</i> of these criteria, rather that <i>I can't seem to find any games that meet more than a few at most</i>. Namely Fiasco and PTA, but again, they too fall short.<br/><br/>Sorcerer has Bangs, and other games have similar ideas. Great. That's one piece.<br/>Many games have advice or rules that drive up the drama of each and every scene. Great. That's one piece.<br/>Many games have advice or rules that tell you to get into a scene late and leave early. Great...<br/>PTA and Fiasco have act structure. Great...<br/>Fiasco has the Tilt and the Aftermath (the cliffhanger and the denouement respectively). Great...<br/>With Great Power has a "lose to eventually win" story structure. Great...<br/>Many story games mechanize non-standard qualities of characters, say their Relationships or Values, like Smallville. Great...<br/>Some games have "yes, but" resolution. Great...<br/>Some games have "no, and" resolution. Great...<br/>Firefly generates complications that take the story sideways. Great...<br/>And more...<br/><br/>The trouble is that a story doesn't just meet one of those criteria and suddenly... it's a Story. For it to be a game that can generate a roughly story shaped play experience mirroring a story in the sense I'm after, it has to meet most or all of them. Be so damned close that I can tack on the last one or two. And no, I don't expect perfection or want to have a finished, perfectly polished screenplay or novel once a game session or campaign is over, but the closer you can get to producing something that meets as many of these criteria as possible and the closer it approaches the feel of a properly structured story, the better. Yeah, even a crappy saggy first-draft of a story-like thing would be a great start. \n<blockquote>One of the reasons I keep bringing up <i>Sorcerer </i>is because, frankly, the game is from a decade and a half ago but most people simply have no understanding of how radical it is as a game -- even now.

Can you please tell me if this is true or not? Because your summation of the game and its "piece" (Bangs) doesn't at all reveal the holistic design elements that produces solid, concrete story. I mean, you simply are blowing off a game that seems to be what you're looking for because... I don't know. I mention one tool from the game. That's not the whole game. I was simply pointing out the game has a tool for exactly what you said a story needs from one of your previous posts.<br/><br/>As for <i>Primetime Adventures</i>, I think the Act section is kind of weak sauce. More importantly are the Issues for the characters. When you played the game, did the GM hammer the Characters' Issues? Did conflicts, when resolved and narrated, create new complications and drive the characters to greater desperation? I ask only because you're only mention of PTA was the acts, when, in fact, the magic lies in: a) boiling the essence of the character down to their Issue; and b) allowing people to narrative both victories and defeats (and both will happen) with additional spins of new complications, using elements already created from the fiction. (I'm not saying you didn't do these things. I'm just curious. I'm actually curios about how the game has gone for you.)<br/><br/>Because here's the thing: I played a game of PTA at a convention. Me as the GM,  one guy who had never played a "story game" before, and a friend of mine who writes TV and Film. <br/><br/>Two things happened:<br/><br/>a) The kid who never played a "story game" before looked all sad when when we wrapped up and said, "I wish I could play this way with my friends all the time. But they'll never believe it's possible."<br/><br/>b) My friend went off to pitch the pilot to CBS. They didn't buy it. But <i>we baked up a TV pilot you could pitch</i>.<br/><br/>So, maybe we played differently than you did. I'm not saying you're playing badly or wrong. I'm curious. <i>I want to understand</i>.<br/><br/><br/>But listen, the big thing here is this: Some people want to play a game like <i>Sorcerer </i>and other story construction games -- and some people don't. The notion that for players who want a game that is all about strategy and planning is something that "must be overcome" is, in my experience, probably not going to pan out. People play what they want to play. If they don't know that what they want is available, that's another thing. But trying to slide people into what they don't want... I've never seen it work well.<br/><br/>And listen, I'm going to be blunt: The whole "I'm experienced," "I've got 30 years of play..." thing really isn't helping at all. I was playing <i>D&amp;D</i> and <i>Traveller </i>forty years ago. I did a play test session for <i>Vampire: The Masquerade</i>. I wrote articles and reviews for White Wolf Magazine. I've written for TSR, FASA, West End Games, and other companies. <i>And none of that matters.</i>  None of that matters when it comes to communicating to you how and what I've played. And <i>vice versa</i>. <br/><br/>All that matters is what was actually played at the table, how it was played in those games. That's it. I'm not trying to be a dick about this. I'm pointing out that that I've watched the "I'm an experience gamer" thing be used for years -- and it never helps a discussion. What does helps is specifics -- specifics about actual games, actual play, actual techniques and procedures used at a table. Not for justification, but just so we all can talk back and forth with actual details that make actual communication possible. <br/><br/>I have a feeling those last paragraphs might make you defensive, might get you back your heels, and make you want to come back swinging. I'm suggesting... don't. Let's talk about actual play and actual games. <br/><br/>If that's something you <i>don't </i>want to do... awesome. Then I know. But at least I know then what kind of conversation you want to have.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html

Can you please tell me if this is true or not? Because your summation of the game and its "piece" (Bangs) doesn't at all reveal the holistic design elements that produces solid, concrete story. I mean, you simply are blowing off a game that seems to be what you're looking for because... I don't know. I mention one tool from the game. That's not the whole game. I was simply pointing out the game has a tool for exactly what you said a story needs from one of your previous posts.</blockquote>\nYes, I have read it. It's been awhile though and I've pulled it out again to have another look.\n<blockquote>As for <i>Primetime Adventures</i>, I think the Act section is kind of weak sauce. More importantly are the Issues for the characters. When you played the game, did the GM hammer the Characters' Issues? Did conflicts, when resolved and narrated, create new complications and drive the characters to greater desperation? I ask only because you're only mention of PTA was the acts, when, in fact, the magic lies in: a) boiling the essence of the character down to their Issue; and b) allowing people to narrative both victories and defeats (and both will happen) with additional spins of new complications, using elements already created from the fiction. (I'm not saying you didn't do these things. I'm just curious. I'm actually curios about how the game has gone for you.)</blockquote>\nI never said the act structure was the godsend piece of PTA, just listed it there because it's one of the few games that has explicit act structure. PTA clearly falls into a few of those other categories, to save time I just left it at "some games", "many game", and "many story games" to save time. \n<blockquote>Because here's the thing: I played a game of PTA at a convention. Me as the GM,  one guy who had never played a "story game" before, and a friend of mine who writes TV and Film. <br/><br/>Two things happened:<br/><br/>a) The kid who never played a "story game" before looked all sad when when we wrapped up and said, "I wish I could play this way with my friends all the time. But they'll never believe it's possible."<br/><br/>b) My friend went off to pitch the pilot to CBS. They didn't buy it. But <i>we baked up a TV pilot you could pitch</i>.<br/><br/>So, maybe we played differently than you did. I'm not saying you're playing badly or wrong. I'm curious. <i>I want to understand</i>.</blockquote>\nGood for you. Too bad for your friend. But that's the whole point of the game, it should work like that. But it's not perfect. You have to push and poke and twist and kick at things in the right way to get that kind of experience. Without constant probing you could just as easily get a flabby game/episode. \n<blockquote>But listen, the big thing here is this: Some people want to play a game like <i>Sorcerer </i>and other story construction games -- and some people don't. The notion that for players who want a game that is all about strategy and planning is something that "must be overcome" is, in my experience, probably not going to pan out. People play what they want to play. If they don't know that what they want is available, that's another thing. But trying to slide people into what they don't want... I've never seen it work well.</blockquote>\nThat's not what I said. Read it again. Many/most trad games are designed in a specific "play to win" style. You said so yourself, so hopefully that point won't be questioned. Many/most story gamers were trad gamers first. Playing lots of trad games that are mostly designed around that same "play to win" style starts to ingrain that style of play as the "proper" way to play in people. Repetition and all that. When players come to story games they're almost always trad players first. So in that sense, when players decide to make the leap from trad to story gaming, there is some "play to win" style mindset that must be overcome. Not that you have to take a trad player and strap them into a chair Clockwork Orange style and force something. Just that an ingrained mindset does form and generally works against story style play.\n<blockquote>All that matters is what was actually played at the table, how it was played in those games. That's it. I'm not trying to be a dick about this. I'm pointing out that that I've watched the "I'm an experience gamer" thing be used for years -- and it never helps a discussion. What does helps is specifics -- specifics about actual games, actual play, actual techniques and procedures used at a table. Not for justification, but just so we all can talk back and forth with actual details that make actual communication possible. </blockquote>\nThat's kinda cute. You're admonishing me for making generalizations without citing specific examples, yet here you are, telling me your generalization without citing specific examples should be good enough for me. But whatever.\n<blockquote>I have a feeling those last paragraphs might make you defensive, might get you back your heels, and make you want to come back swinging. I'm suggesting... don't. Let's talk about actual play and actual games.<br/><br/>If that's something you <i>don't</i> want to do... awesome. Then I know. But at least I know then what kind of conversation you want to have.</blockquote>\nHere's what I've seen in "actual play" discussions and how this part of the conversation goes. You ask for actual play experiences, I provide them. Then you and 2-3 other people on the thread pick apart everything I say to find any fault or tweak or fuck-up that was made anywhere from start to finish of the actual game. Mechanics, players, GM, setting, page citations, whatever. "Well the problem is your GM didn't know what they were doing, they should have done X." And a thousand variations on that same theme. I disagree that we are incapable of making generalizations of play experience from specific examples, to you the only thing that matters is exact, specific examples from the field. That's great. I think that's a waste of time.<br/><br/>The kind of conversation I want to have is about story games that hit as many of the criteria I mentioned above. If you're saying Sorcerer hits every single one of those, except maybe the act structure, then great. I'll give it another look. But I don't remember it being all that. Great game, sure.

Would that player be willing to win at a a cost?<br/><br/>If you had a player who wanted to be the underdog, the fuck-up and didn't care if he "won" but just wanted to be the "big damn hero" at the right moment, would that be acceptable? Even if everyone knew before-hand that it wouldn't happen until the finale?<br/><br/>The point is: there are ways of introducing "awesome" without scripting them in <i>detail</i>. There's ways of referencing seemingly inconsequential details that suddenly everything hinges upon.<br/>There was a time-travel movie that I didn't see and can't remember the name (not fond of time-travel in general), but the premise was that he had amnesia and an envelope of ordinary items that would become essential to him. He just didn't know how or why.<br/><br/>Consider movie trailers. They're not spoilers; they show you just enough to pull you in. Just enough of the premise, just enough of the action/danger.<br/><br/>You're surrounded; hopelessly outnumbered by orcs. One of the character's turns and sees...something even worse.<br/><br/>You throw down your staff and shout "You shall not pass!"<br/><br/>Aragorn falls off a cliff (okay, that's a bad example).<br/><br/>RPGs are generally front-loaded with "awesome" characters, settings and rules. And when you tip the box, the puzzle is supposed to either just fall into place or you have to listen to people justify why it's a glorious mess. I'm equally dismissive of them. Different strokes. Sometimes, I like to have the corners and edge pieces to one side before I begin to see the picture. I'll certainly look at the box cover to see what the Hell its supposed to be. That's just me. The question is: what is it that you want?

I suppose that's the nature of the internets for you!\n<blockquote><br/>If your goal in designing the game is to more closely emulate the way fiction actually operates, then the closer you get to the way fiction actually operates the better. Whether that makes for a fun gaming experience and why or why not is a separate though important question. If the answer is "No, that's not fun" I would submit that the reason why not is that deep need to win.<br/></blockquote>\nHere I disagree with you quite strongly, and this may be the crux of our discussion here.<br/><br/>Arguably the most "close emulation" of a book in spoken form would be a single author, preparing a story and scripting it in advance, and then reading it aloud to a group of audience members (who would presumably be sitting around a table with dice in hand). And rolling those dice in a form of applause when the author concludes his story.<br/><br/>The more we want to turn storytelling into an interactive and spontaneous activity, the more we have to change our methods, and the assumptions that go with them.<br/><br/>The hypothetical activity I just described *could* be fun, but it cuts out all but one player's participation. I would not say, sitting in the audience, that I played a fun game that evening. This has absolutely nothing to do with a desire to "win". It has to do with a desire for human interaction, social creativity, spontaneous sharing of emotion, anticipation... all that stuff.<br/><br/>Speaking purely for myself, I want to play a game to surprise my friends and to be surprised by them in turn, as well as to inhabit the minds of some of the characters in the story. Making this activity interactive means we have to throw away certain tools (a common one to throw away is the foreknowledge of what happens later in the story - we could, perhaps, tell a better story if we scripted everything in advance, but it's more fun to play with expectations and suspense; it's more fun not to know how things will end).\n<blockquote><blockquote>b) As Butcher writes, the key to story is conflict, and, specifically, conflict between active *tagonists. Story emerges from their clash of ideas, and the actions they take to get what they want.<br/><br/>In this context, it's very helpful to allow different parties to fight for their goals: we get this very organically by putting different players in charge of different characters and then giving them tools to challenge each other.</blockquote>\nIt sounds as if your default assumption is GM-less play combined with strict PvP. I see no reason to make that assumption.<br/></blockquote>\nI don't see it as being as limited as that. For instance, when you play a trad RPG and you play out a conflict between a warrior leaving home and his wife, what do you have?<br/><br/>You have one player playing the role of the warrior, and arguing for what he wants. You have another player (often the GM) playing the role of the wife, arguing for what *she* wants.<br/><br/>That's exactly the format I was alluding to. <br/><br/>Another way to look at it: we don't usually play out scenes where two NPCs bicker and fight. Why not? Mostly because it's not interesting or fun to come to the table to watch one player have a pretend disagreement with himself.<br/><br/>Part of the fun is that we don't know who will come out ahead; who will succeed and who will fail. To adopt a structure like you're suggesting, we'd have to throw away this uncertainty, and determine before we even play that the warrior loses the conflict. ("No, and.") That doesn't seem very appealing to me - I'd rather discover it in play.\n<blockquote><br/>By comparison, John sliding down the stairs and breaking Tony's neck is boring. It's the consequences of that action (the brother's revenge subplot) that's the interesting piece of that scene.<br/></blockquote>\nIt seems to me that this is how RPGs (at least the ones which produce good stories) work. Certain protagonists formulate goals ("break his neck") and chase them, succeeding much of the time. However, complications and setbacks arise, which makes things more complicated and interesting (the "yes, but" part).<br/><br/>I like your idea here, though: maybe we've become too dependent on this structure? What else can we do?<br/><br/>The interesting part, I think, is finding practical ways of doing this, or discussing actual games, or actual moments of play. This kind of hypothetical debate doesn't give us too much to grapple with. Do you have any practical ideas for how we can drive play with more "no, and" moments?<br/>\n<blockquote><blockquote>As even Butcher writes himself, the "no, and" or "no" outcomes should be used sparingly (even in fiction!) or it can quickly get very frustrating.</blockquote>\nYou might have misread his advice then. Though he does say simple "no" should be used with caution, he says "no, and" is hands-down the single most interesting and useful resolution of any given scene as it creates the most fun experience. \n<blockquote>[...]<br/>THIS answer is really the one that gives you the most interesting scenes, provides the meat for the most interesting and endearing sequels, and is generally the Big Gun you pull out when your plot is slowing down. </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\nI understood his statement that this is "generally the Big Gun you pull out when your plot is slowing down" meant you weren't doing this ALL THE TIME. I could be wrong in that assumption, though!\n<blockquote><br/>This is where part of that tension between story expectations and gaming expectations comes in. In fiction the idea is to pound the character as hard as possible, make their lives suck as much as possible, hammer hammer hammer them into a tiny little corner, and when they've had enough and are on the verge of breaking... you hammer them some more. <br/></blockquote>\nThis is where you're having a disagreement with Christopher. Have you played <i>nicotine girls</i>, <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>, <i>Grey Ranks</i>, <i>Polaris</i>, <i>My Life with Master</i>, or <i>kagematsu</i>, with story gamers who understand how those games should go?<br/><br/>My experience is that it's very possible to see exactly that kind of fiction in those games.<br/><br/>I've mentioned several of the ways we achieve this indirectly (while maintaining the fun of and excitement of uncertainty) upthread.<br/><br/>* We can frame play as a series of conflicts between powerful protagonists, and have certain characters win them. Those characters then become the de facto antagonists/villains, and the losers of the conflicts become our heroes. (e.g. <i>In a Wicked Age...</i>)<br/><br/>No need for an assumption of failure, here. We can play and be surprised.<br/><br/>* We can play with people who are well aware of the need to fulfill certain story roles ("playing to lose"), and do so happily. Get a group like that around the table (and I still maintain that most gamers have no trouble doing this once they see it in action, and non-gamers often "get it" immediately).<br/><br/>* We can design games which frame a character's "success" in a limited enough fashion that getting what you want feels like failure (e.g. Otherkind dice) - put the character under enough pressure that they can win as much as they want and they're still "losing" in the bigger picture. <br/><br/>This is what Bangs do: a typical example is a moral dilemma. If I tell you that your son and your wife are both drowning, but you can only reach one of them, you can make your decision and then "succeed" in saving the one you chose... but that's certainly not "winning" in this situation - the outcome is still that you've lost someone you cared about.<br/><br/> * We can design games where you have the tools to win, but they are not matched to your character's desires. A Dog can win pretty much any conflict if she's willing to push hard enough and pull out the guns. But we put her up against conflicts that her guns can't solve.<br/><br/>The outcome? Same, again: the character might "win" in some kind of technical sense, but from the perspective of the story, we all know that this was a loss.<br/><br/>I'll stop here. I'm just brainstorming, anyway. I'm sure there are many more.<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434968">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434968/#Comment_434968" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-07T18:37:46+00:00" title="July  7, 2014  6:37PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 7, 2014 6:46PM by Paul_T.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The other point Christopher is speaking up against is your assumption that the more concrete something is (e.g. Act structure), the better the resulting story.<br/><br/>I'm curious: Let's say the government enacted a law tomorrow which said that all writers, authors, screenwrights, and so on HAD to formulate their stories in the format of a four-Act play, and that their main characters could not achieve any kind of success until they were 85% of the way through the story's length.<br/><br/>Do you believe that the world would be a better place? Would art thrive, would all our stories be better?<br/><br/>Speaking as a designer AND a player, I've generally enjoyed games which were more open-ended more. As a consumer of art, I like formulaic plots (like Jim Butcher's books and many other bestsellers). They can be very enjoyable. But I *really* like when something breaks the mold.<br/><br/>I just read a fantastic play called "The Swearing Jar", written by a friend of mine. It has won a huge number of awards and been performed through Canada and the U-S-and-A.<br/><br/>It moves people; it's funny and it's cathartic and it's heartbreaking.<br/><br/>It very emphatically does NOT follow any of this advice. There is no act structure. There's rarely conflict in the scenes, and they rarely end with the protagonist "losing". It's not told in chronological order.<br/><br/>I believe that the reason story games each have "certain pieces" of the formulas that create good story (losing early in the story, act structure, etc, etc, as you point out) is that putting them all into place *at the same time* limits us too much.<br/><br/>More important, perhaps, it's completely unnecessary. These games carefully choose *which* limitations we need to play, and let us handle the rest, using our own intuition and sense of story.<br/><br/>(Incidentally, I'm very skeptical that Fiasco qualifies as a "four-Act" play just because it happens to have four scenes per character. I've never seen the four-Act structure defined as "having one scene featuring each character in each Act".)<br/><br/>Speaking from my own experience:<br/><br/>I've written a few games which rely on a strong sense of a climactic build-up to the end of the story: to tell good stories, they must produce this consistently.<br/><br/>I found, in various versions and various playtests, that only a few elements were necessary for this to happen. And a structure which enforced this kind of escalation was <i>not one of them</i>. Given a few other pieces, the human beings playing the games did this very naturally, using their own sense of what makes a good story. <br/><br/>Every time. In every playtest.<br/><br/>So, I believe that good design (like good art) doesn't need to be shackled at every corner; it needs to find the sweet spot of *just enough* of the tried-and-true but *not so much* that it overwhelms out creative abilities. Just the right level of creative constraint, and no more.<br/><br/>Like Christopher says, a game is like an instrument, a painter's palette, a writer's vocabulary: it doesn't and shouldn't tell the story for you. <br/><br/>Sure, we could make a game which forcibly produces a "perfect" story every time.<br/><br/>My instinct says that such a game wouldn't be much fun to play, and wouldn't create very memorable stories. They'd be "technically correct", they would follow all the rules, but, by the very same token, they would feel predictable and formulaic. And the players playing them would feel constrained and bored.<br/><br/>That's my position. I'm open to arguments to the contrary; I think it would be quite fun to see some of these assumptions challenged. They've given me some great gaming experiences, though, and helped me tell some fantastic stories.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434970">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434970/#Comment_434970" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-07T19:01:06+00:00" title="July  7, 2014  7:01PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm interested in where this is heading, because I think there's a lot to be gained from starting to think about structure and story in gaming. But (no, but or yes, but?) I also note there's some stuff being talked about without, as the saying goes, our terms being all defied.<br/><br/>Let's start with the act structure that liblarva is interested in. They've brought up the classical TV episode structure:<br/><br/>Teaser<br/>Act I-IV<br/>Tag<br/><br/>Now, I happen to think that TV episodes are going to give the most bang for your buck in terms of mapping structure to recurring games (like a campaign or other series with recurring characters.) But...not every TV show uses that structure. (The BSG reboot &amp; the Quinn Martin shows didn't have a teaser, going from the opening credits straight to Act I, for example.) I'm mentioning that not to say it's not applicable, but to point out that there's more than just one way to structure the acts.<br/><br/>For that matter, just what the heck <i>is</i> an Act, anyway? That's really not been discussed. Film Crit Hulk has a <a href="http://filmcrithulk.wordpress.com/2011/07/07/hulk-presents-the-myth-of-3-act-structure/" rel="nofollow">pretty good essay on this</a> (which criticizes the the three act structure of movies, btw) that gives a good definition, namely:<br/><br/>An Act is an irrevocable decision point.<br/><br/>An Act ends when something has happened that <i>changes</i> the story or the characters in a way that can't be undone. It's propulsive, it creates the new situation that the characters will respond to.<br/><br/>Let's look at an example probably most folks here are familiar with: the Star Trek (TOS) episode, <i>City on the Edge of Forever</i>. Here's how the Acts break up, based on the commercial breaks:<br/><br/>Teaser: Sulu gets hurt, McCoy injects himself with a drug, goes nuts.<br/>Act I: McCoy escapes to the planet, Kirk et al follow. Gateway discovered, McCoy goes through, present is altered wiping out the Enterprise<br/>Act II: Spock and Kirk go back to the 1930s in pursuit of McCoy; take refuge at the mission. Spock begins building device to read the tricorder. Kirk becomes attracted to Edith Keeler. Spock discovers there are two possible futures; act ends on the words "Edith Keeler must die."<br/>Act III: McCoy arrives, shelters at Mission without Kirk and Spock seeing him. Kirk realizes he is in love with Edith. Spock finds out which future they need: "Edith Keeler must die."<br/>Act IV: Spock warns Kirk about protecting Edith when she nearly falls down stairs. Kirk, Spock, McCoy reunite; Kirk keeps McCoy from saving Edith. <br/>Tag (note that there's no break here, ST: TOS didn't have one between Act IV &amp; the Tag): Kirk, Spock, McCoy return to the future, everything as it was; reject offer of the Gateway. "Let's get the hell out of here."<br/><br/>...And that's all well and good! But you could break it other ways. You could make the Teaser integrated with Act I (it really is--this was more a function of the medium), and have Act I end when McCoy goes through. Inside the long Act II, you could break it (key point is when they borrow the watchmaker tools, and Edith finds out), with Spock's discoveries bracketing a short but nasty Act IV. (In the Film Crit Hulk essay, he talks a lot about the critical nature of Act IV in Shakespeare but how it is also the least compelling part of the story, because it's the twisty section.)<br/><br/>Also, too, shows like Reboot BSG &amp; Buffy the Vampire Slayer often wrap up the main action even before the tag scene, using the short time between the :45 commerical break and the tag break to forward the "mythos" or metaplot action of the season.<br/><br/>My point being, if you're going to talk about structuring a game dramatically, with acts, it behooves you to think about just what the heck that means, and what it is supposed to do.<br/><br/>Now a second point, that's a bit subtle. Both Mamet and Butcher are addressing a somewhat specialized situation--a series, with established and recurring characters. Both of them can talk about every scene ending with "thwarting" because the fundamentals of character have <i>already been established</i>. It's pointless to do any kind of character exposition on <i>The Unit</i> because the audience already knows who the characters are; if new details are being revealed, well, that's the plot and the drama should be forming around that. Ditto for Butcher.<br/><br/>(Or more subtly: because the writers know who the characters are, they can shape the scenes to reveal this; crucial for people in the audience jumping into the series for the first time without knowing the characters.)<br/><br/>But in a lot of story games, that condition doesn't always obtain. We may not know who these characters are yet. It may take a while for that to get sorted out. But the thing that Mamet &amp; Butcher are really talking about is <i>the drive the characters already have</i>. Authors have an advantage here, because this is one of the things that gets hammered out in the course of finishing a work. Yes, your characters surprise you...during the writing. When you finalize the work, you know where they are going, and what they want, and scenes will get tightened to heighten drama.<br/><br/>(There is at least one game I can think of that tries to capture some of this: <i>My Daughter the Queen of France</i>, where the motivation &amp; emotion of the scenes gradually gets layered in <i>after</i> we know how they will play out.)<br/><br/>I should note that the games that have a strong act structure (Fiasco, Lady Blackbird*) <i>also</i> have strongly developed characters that exist before the game is even played--the Fiasco playset generates motivations brilliantly, although I should note that the twist is done "offstage" and it becomes necessary for the players to incorporate it into their later scenes. <br/><br/>I want to end with a few words about "no, but". First, thanks liblarva--this discussion has made me see how my standard method of running combats--escalate, escalate, escalate--is really about doing "no, but" and thwarting the characters over a series of actions. All well and good! But we need to be very careful about our understanding of how things are "thwarted." Take, for example, the Vorkosigan Saga. Miles is very, very smart and very, very good. A lot of the time, he <i>wins</i>, and not just during the denouement. Now, Bujold being a good writer, it's not so easy--but she tends to go the "more information is revealed" route than the "character suffers a setback" route. (This post is long enough, but I could take a look at one of the books to see how this is played out in more detail.)<br/><br/>Anyway. Long story short, let's maybe move past just a theoretical understanding &amp; start looking, perhaps, at what kinds of stories are we telling? What kinds of stories could work for games? What kinds <i>couldn't</i>? Could, say, <i>The Sound and the Fury</i> be done as a game? Why or why not? And if yes, what kind of a game would that look like?<br/><br/><br/>* One of the things this discussion has made me realize is that among the other brilliant things John Harper did in that game, he built a three-act structure into it (Act I, escape the Hand of Sorrow; Act II, find the route to Uriah; Act III, confront Uriah).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434971">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434971/#Comment_434971" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-07T19:01:35+00:00" title="July  7, 2014  7:01PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 7, 2014 7:03PM by Rickard.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Part of the fun is that we don't know who will come out ahead; who will succeed and who will fail.

So even if we know that it's going to be a "No", we don't know what the "and" will be, and that's where the uncertainty lies.<br/><br/>And that's what Butcher is saying in his <a href="http://jimbutcher.livejournal.com/2880.html" rel="nofollow">article about sequels</a>. "Sequels are what happens as an aftermath to a scene. /.../ The heart of your character--and your reader--is in the sequel." A conflict is only a matter for reaching the sequel.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Just want to add that I think this challenging thought of always saying "No" feels interesting, because I always want to say "Yes" in my games. I realize that I took the totally wrong approach in my first post, where I more described how I wanted to play instead of taking in someone else's opinion. That's not the way to learn, and if I can't learn and instead repeating the same shit all over in every thread, then my thoughts will become inbred.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/liblarva" title="liblarva"><img alt="liblarva" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/liblarva">liblarva</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434972/#Comment_434972" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-07T19:01:45+00:00" title="July  7, 2014  7:01PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><a href="/forums/profile/liblarva">@liblarva</a>  Perhaps if we could identify (and identify with) what you think constitutes a good story/game experience, there would be less "you should do this/you're not doing that" and more "what techniques might create that experience?"</blockquote>\nA good story has an interesting character who is hopefully at least mildly sympathetic. An engaging and interesting inciting incident that kicks off the story in an exciting and dramatic way. Scenes should be dramatic, with twists and turns ending in some kind of setback (whether the protagonist succeeds in their short term goal or not). The story unfolds as the protagonist tries and fails their way through scene after scene while the action and tension rises, hitting the act break cliffhangers, pinches, plot points, till they hit the low point where everything looks to be lost. The protagonist rallies, starts turning things around is small ways at first, then bigger and bigger ways as they close in on the resolution to the overarching story problem (that was set up in the inciting incident). The protagonist wins in a drama/comedy; the protagonist loses in a tragedy. There's some kind of denouement where things are wrapped up. That's the gist of it. There's more of course. Good writing, acting, editing, score, etc. but that's all for the specific medium and simply consuming the media rather than creating it.\n<blockquote>If, for example, you had a player who wanted to win, would you be willing to guarantee that player a win?  Would that player be willing to win at a a cost?<br/><br/>If you had a player who wanted to be the underdog, the fuck-up and didn't care if he "won" but just wanted to be the "big damn hero" at the right moment, would that be acceptable? Even if everyone knew before-hand that it wouldn't happen until the finale?</blockquote>\nThat's the niggling misconception here. It's not that the character cannot win, it's that the character can't resolve the story before the climax. They can break into an office in the first act one (win), but they can't murder the big bad guy in his sleep in act one.<br/><br/>Most stories ultimately resolve with the protagonists winning. What makes them interesting stories is the hell the protagonists have to crawl through to get there first. So there's no problem having characters win at task or scene conflict level stuff, but they can't end the movie 20 minutes in by winning the overarching story question. But, as per the drama advice of Mamet and Butcher (among dozens of others), there should always be a setback in every scene. Mamet calls this a failure which has caused some confusion here, but the Butcher article clears this up somewhat. So whether the character wins or loses a given scene there must always be a setback because that's what kicks the story forward in interesting and entertaining ways.\n<blockquote>The point is: there are ways of introducing "awesome" without scripting them in <i>detail</i>. There's ways of referencing seemingly inconsequential details that suddenly everything hinges upon.</blockquote>\nI'm not talking about scripting things in advance. Nothing more than "here's a murder, you're cops, let's go" at least. Creative collaboration, collective storytelling, storygaming, that's what I'm shooting for.

There's only so many times and ways you can pound your head into what appears to be a brick wall before something starts to give.\n<blockquote>Part of the fun is that we don't know who will come out ahead; who will succeed and who will fail. To adopt a structure like you're suggesting, we'd have to throw away this uncertainty, and determine before we even play that the warrior loses the conflict. ("No, and.") That doesn't seem very appealing to me - I'd rather discover it in play.</blockquote>\nNo, we wouldn't. That's a reoccurring misconception throughout the thread. The most interesting resolutions to a scene question are: "No, and" along with "Yes, but". However, if the player insists on framing a story ending scene five minutes into the game, then the answer, so that play and the drama can continue, must be "no, and". In Die Hard, if John McClane got back together with his wife the moment they saw each other (as per his stated desire in the dialogue with Argyle the limo driver), then that story would be over. Drama and tension drained away. If when John framed the scene to call the fire department out had resulted in the terrorists simply giving up, then that story would be over. All drama and tension drained away. The only way to keep that story going is to not let the drama and tension out by allowing players to solve the problem simply and early. \n<blockquote>My experience is that it's very possible to see exactly that kind of fiction in those games.</blockquote>\nSure, but again, that's only one piece to the puzzle.\n<blockquote>I'll stop here. I'm just brainstorming, anyway. I'm sure there are many more.</blockquote>\nAnd some of those could work, I'm sure. But I'm a big fan of games that are explicit in their rules. If play should unfold a particular way then there should be rules to enforce that style of play, whatever it may be. If there is an explicit structure of how play should unfold, there should be explicit rules for that in the game. If there's GM advice on how things <i>should</i> unfold, that's asking for trouble. If movement is an important component of the game, then have rules for movement. If relationships are an important component, have rules for them. If you leave it up to some amorphous "advice", you're going to create confusion.\n<blockquote>The other point Christopher is speaking up against is your assumption that the more concrete something is (e.g. Act structure), the better the resulting story.</blockquote>\nI never said that. What I said was the more explicitly like a traditionally structured story game play is, the more like a traditionally structured story the actual play will be, and therefore the more I will like it. I have no illusions that it could still be a bad story. It's simply that the resultant bad story will at least have the right structure.\n<blockquote>I'm curious: Let's say the government enacted a law tomorrow which said that all writers, authors, screenwrights, and so on HAD to formulate their stories in the format of a four-Act play, and that their main characters could not achieve any kind of success until they were 85% of the way through the story's length.<br/><br/>Do you believe that the world would be a better place? Would art thrive, would all our stories be better?</blockquote>\nHuh. I thought you were honestly engaging the discussion up till this point. Since I'm already here I'll finish out my response. That's too bad.\n<blockquote>I believe that the reason story games each have "certain pieces" of the formulas that create good story (losing early in the story, act structure, etc, etc, as you point out) is that putting them all into place *at the same time* limits us too much.</blockquote>\nI would disagree and point to those same best-sellers and one-hour TV drama that are so damned enjoyable. Clearly they're not that limiting in that context. It might be the equivalent to a "rules heavy"/"crunchy" story game compared to many/most other story games, but I don't think it would be creatively limiting.\n<blockquote>(Incidentally, I'm very skeptical that Fiasco qualifies as a "four-Act" play just because it happens to have four scenes per character. I've never seen the four-Act structure defined as "having one scene featuring each character in each Act".)</blockquote>\nI never said it had four act structure, only that it had act structure. Which it does. Act One and Act Two. Each act finishing with a plot point, end of act one that's the tilt, end of act two that's the aftermath.\n<blockquote>Like Christopher says, a game is like an instrument, a painter's palette, a writer's vocabulary: it doesn't and shouldn't tell the story for you. <br/><br/>Sure, we could make a game which forcibly produces a "perfect" story every time.</blockquote>\nI never said they should tell the story for you, only structure them properly.<br/><br/>I never said they would be perfect stories, only structured properly, and hopefully work better as stories (focused scenes, kicked up drama, setbacks, etc).\n<blockquote>Quite right. In Butcher's own advice, about 50% of the action is, by default, a "scene".</blockquote>\nI'm sorry, but could you point to the specific spot/quote where he said "about 50%" in this context?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434978">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434978/#Comment_434978" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-07T19:49:04+00:00" title="July  7, 2014  7:49PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 7, 2014 7:59PM by Paul_T.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/liblarva">@liblarva</a>,<br/><br/>I am engaging in this honestly.

It sounds like you *want* to formalize all this stuff.<br/><br/>I think my hypothetical about a Federal story-structure law is actually relevant here. The questions are:<br/><br/>* Would it produce better stories?<br/>* Would the writers enjoy their jobs as much?<br/><br/>It sounds like you want more story structure in your games, yes?<br/><br/>That's a valid personal preference.

No, you can desire the best possible stories, or the most interesting stories, or the most original stories.

How could you, if you're playing the game as written? It's simply not possible, barring some really really bizarre that I perhaps can't imagine.<br/><br/>It's not really possible to follow the rules of the game and still frame a scene which allows a PC to roll to go aggro (or whatever) and thereby resolve all of the MC's Fronts in one fell swoop - particularly if, as intended, many of the character's goals are romantic or familial or otherwise not resolvable by "going aggro".<br/><br/>Lots of other games have other ways of enforcing this kind of thing. I've written several games myself where some kind of mechanic limits your ability to affect your ultimate goal until the end of the story - it works very well.<br/><br/>But there are also other options, which don't seem to be covered by this logic:<br/><br/>* Playing out a story without knowing, ahead of time, who the protagonists are. (Unlike writers, we don't know how our story will end, because we don't have the luxury of backtracking and editing the beginning as many times as we like.)<br/><br/>* Playing out a form of "story" which isn't as heavily bound by traditional story-telling formulae. (Game of Thrones comes to mind; it's obviously commercially successful fiction, but one of the reasons people like it is because it flaunts many of these "expected" story devices - for instance, by being willing to kill off important protagonists before it might seem "dramatically correct".)<br/><br/>etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434981">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434981/#Comment_434981" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-07T20:01:20+00:00" title="July  7, 2014  8:01PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Re: the 50% - Butcher explains that the best default mode of writing, in his opinion is SCENE - SEQUEL - SCENE - SEQUEL - SCENE... etc., alternating one after the other.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434983">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/liblarva" title="liblarva"><img alt="liblarva" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/liblarva">liblarva</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434983/#Comment_434983" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-07T20:15:39+00:00" title="July  7, 2014  8:15PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>(Re: the 50% - Butcher explains that the best default mode of writing, in his opinion is SCENE - SEQUEL - SCENE - SEQUEL - SCENE... etc., alternating one after the other.)</blockquote>\nI know that is the order, as a sequel is the emotional response to a scene, however I'm curious where you get the half or 50% from as a sequel can last any length the writer wants. They're a pacing and color mechanism. <br/><br/>To go straight to the source, what Butcher says is:\n<blockquote>If that wasn't enough, Sequel-to-Scene ratio is the single largest factor for controlling pace. Sequels have a unanimous tendancy to slow the pace of your story, while scenes have the opposite effect. If you've ever read a book and felt like it blurred by too fast and never seemed to touch on anything long enough, go back and look at it. You WILL find that the book's scenes took up a great deal more space than its sequels. If you've read a book that you thought was too slow, too cerebral, or that wandered back and forth while droning on and on, go back and look at it. You WILL find that sequels took up a hell of a lot more page space than scenes.<br/><br/>It's a balancing act, and how you stack up scene-to-sequel is going to depend on several factors, including your genre and your audience. Romance, for example, is really nothing BUT sequels with occasional scenes to make them stick together. Romance wallows in sequels, because that's what it's ABOUT--emotions, feelings. <br/><br/>If you write an action book, those emotional passages--not so much. You'll want to spend more time and effort on the scenes, and make sure that the sequels don't start to outweigh them. If you're writing for a more cerebral, mature audience, they have a much higher desire/tolerance for sequels than if you write for, for example, young adults. The older audience might well be more interested in the thought and emotion behind the plot, while the younger audience might want you to stop moaning and dithering and get straight to the point. You control that pace by balancing sequels with scenes.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434984/#Comment_434984" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-07T20:21:07+00:00" title="July  7, 2014  8:21PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yep, exactly right.

This technique, this structure, works for a whole lot of popular fiction. There's no reason to assume it can't or won't work in gaming. <br/><br/>We absolutely can play with the balance, but it's not a question of two scenes then a sequel, rather the length of each. Action fiction is long on scene, short on sequel; romance is short on scene, long and sequel. Same structure, huge variety of resulting story.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434988/#Comment_434988" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-07T20:54:05+00:00" title="July  7, 2014  8:54PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's not just length, but also the ratio - he says, for instance, that romance "is really nothing BUT sequels with occasional scenes to make them stick together".<br/><br/>I am a big believer in creative constraint.

I honestly do not understand why anyone would want this to be a model for story games. The character always failing is exactly as boring as the character always succeeding; prescribing this as a model for fiction -- let alone interactive, improvisational roleplaying -- just makes no sense to me. Die Hard was not a good movie because of the structure of its conflict, or because it adhered to some formula of endless protagonist failure. And lest it be suggested that this formula is somehow a minimum or baseline required for success, there are tons of great movies that have nothing remotely like this sort of structure.<br/><br/>It's obviously a good idea to think about narrative structure when playing and especially designing a game, but the notion that only games that adhere to this One Specific Model are producing 'real stories' or 'good stories' is poisonous to interesting gameplay and design. Every game has its own needs, and every game can have its own conventions and structures and ways of having players interact with conflict and storytelling. <br/><br/>The whole idea that it is the failure or success, the 'need to win' or not, just seems way beside the point of what makes for interesting dramatic scenes. It's the <i>aboutness</i> that makes them interesting, and gives them focus; it's that the character wants something <i>at all</i>, and that the thing they want and their desire for it is in of itself interesting and compelling to us. That they get it or do not get it in any particular scene is not what makes it a story or not. The need to 'win' is not the problem; the need to <i>resolve things conclusively is</i>, if anything, a more damaging impulse, because it defuses or negates or fulfills the desire too quickly. <br/><br/>Either way, 'protagonist failure' and 'protagonist success' both presuppose that there is something relevant that can be succeeded at or failed at -- that there is a goal or desire that matters to us, as players or as readers. If you've reached the point of deciding whether the character succeeds or fails, then you already have a story. It may turn out to be shorter than you want, or longer, but the 'real story' part is already done, even if the very first thing the hero does is kiss the girl and kill the dragon and grab the treasure and ride off on his perfect white horse. Even if the hero suffers an interminably tedious number of socially and physically battering setbacks until finally they manage to have a shower and solve the case with the help of their talking skull. And sure, if that happens every time, it could get boring, but it won't stop being a story.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434998">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434998/#Comment_434998" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-08T05:13:04+00:00" title="July  8, 2014  5:13AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "There should be a game that ___."<br/><br/>By nature, the gods and all that is beautiful, you're right!

Examples:<br/><br/>TGTBTU above. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Good,_the_Bad_and_the_Ugly#Plot" rel="nofollow">plot</a> seems to have a number of instances in which Blondie is successful in conflict. <br/><br/>Silence of the Lambs: Clarisse does succeed in getting ever closer and closer to finding the killer. <br/><br/>Blade Runner: Deckard does succeed in tracking and retiring a number of replicants, even if at a cost. <br/><br/>Bloodsport (it IS a good movie!): Frank Dux succeeds in beating a great number of opponents to make it to the finals. He also succeeds in evading the police officers that want to take him out of the tournament. <br/><br/>Dumb &amp; Dumber: The protagonists succeed in overcoming a number of obstacles despite themselves! <br/><br/>Predator: This is one movie where I see a lot more of "no, and" happening. Arnie &amp; Co. usually fail to even hurt the Predator and on top of that they're being iced one by one. <br/><br/>I was looking for the quote, but I remember reading some advice along the lines of throwing a badger onto the protagonist's lap whenever things got too comfortable. It sounded like "yes, but", essentially. That seems to be the way I experience most stories. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435004/#Comment_435004" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-08T07:33:19+00:00" title="July  8, 2014  7:33AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 8, 2014 7:38AM by Rickard.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What I think when reading all this is that "Yes, but", "No, but" and "No, and" are the same things, and people are probably talking about the same thing from different perspectives.  Paul_T and liblarva did it towards the end, as an example. They are both describing the same happening, and so are other people that speaking of one method before another. I mean, there must be a reason why everybody sees their own method in everything, right?<br/><br/> I started off with this thread to talk about my This Is Pulp and how the heroes always succeeds, but the game master got "Yes, and/but" techniques to answer back. I know there are games that has minor disadvantages with their "buts", but when I talk about Yes/No...but/and, these pictures are painted in my head.<br/><br/>"Yes, but I'm gonna fuck you up anyway."<br/>"No, but I can throw you a bone."<br/>"No, and this is why you shouldn't had done that."<br/><br/>What all these basically does is to create another situation. "Yes, but" and "No, but" are the same things, but opposite. "Yes, you can win but your reward is only a minor thing because I'm going to invent something that renders your action ... not meaningless, but reduce it to only a step in the way". The "No, but" can seem to be more honest. "You don't get it, but I can give you this minor thing anyway".<br/><br/>I can guess that the "No, and" is the most honest one. "No, you can't win and I'm going to tell you why. It's because I got some unforeseen events to share to you. [improvised or not]".<br/><br/>These three things are only variations of giving the same result.<br/><br/>I guess we at least can agree on always winning is the most boring thing?<br/><br/>What I will take with me from this thread is that there should (always?) be a time for reminisces. Dunno if any roleplaying game has that (No, refreshment scenes doesn't count).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435014">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Oren" title="Oren"><img alt="Oren" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Oren">Oren</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435014/#Comment_435014" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-08T13:29:37+00:00" title="July  8, 2014  1:29PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            PTA has reflection scenes in the PC's personal set, which mechanically refresh the character and narratively function exactly like Butcher's sequels.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435032/#Comment_435032" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-09T10:15:49+00:00" title="July  9, 2014 10:15AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This "Hulk" critic person puts it quite well when he writes about the "Hero's Journey":\n<blockquote>A LOT LIKE HULK\u2019S DISMISSAL OF 3 ACT STRUCTURE, THE PROBLEM WITH JOSEPH CAMPBELL\u2019S THE HERO WITH A THOUSAND FACES IS NOT IT\u2019S LACK OF ACCURACY, BUT INSTEAD WHAT WE DO WITH THE INFORMATION IT PROVIDES.

THE TRUTH ABOUT CAMPBELL\u2019S LAUDED BOOK IS IT ACTUALLY DOESN\u2019T HAVE A TON TO DO WITH ALL THOSE NEAT THE LITTLE DIAGRAMS AT THE BEGINNING, IT\u2019S MORE INTERESTED IN CULTURAL DEDUCTION BASED ON THOSE CONCEPTS.

Basically, make a game with a list of expected story elements/tropes and attach them to Yahtzee combinations.  Let the dice determine the order.  Do something with the total score to determine something about the outcome maybe.  You could use it for something Hero's Journey-esque or maybe on an episode/session level: "okay, we got a small straight, that means we're doing the episode where everyone is on jury duty".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19563/slow-down-story-expectations-vs-gaming-expectations" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19563/slow-down-story-expectations-vs-gaming-expectations" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19563/slow-down-story-expectations-vs-gaming-expectations/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F19563%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F19563%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
