Well here is your chance!<br/><br/>Jump the shark is a game about a bunch of writers, locked in an office, forced to write the worst most outlandish scripts imaginable. They work for the B Movie network so good writing is unimportant. Plot development and continuity are irrelevant. The only thing the producers want is a finished product. The writers want out (because the poo bucket in the corner is getting a little too full) so they write, but to keep themselves sane they make it fun. They decide to make a game out of it. They write outrageous scenes and then make them more outrageous. To keep things interesting they introduce an element of gambling.

Mostly pulpy games, or games based on TV shows (Battlestar Galactica, Farscape). It's fabulous. <br/><br/>My current group has the ritual of sitting down, getting our gibblies out by talking too much and being silly, and then the GM prompts "so what happened last time?" And then we collectively tell tales of our last session, hilarious points we remember or that stood out to us, and really intense or beautiful scenes we like to recall. Then, we jump into the game. It's kind of a collaborative monologue.<br/><br/>I've been thinking about monologues in games. Like, monologue instead of flashback for characters, in the middle of the narrative. But that's a bit off-topic. <br/><br/>I think what you did is fabulous fun, Graham. I've started games like that before, for sure. Mostly moody, dark, or setting heavy games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_319052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeBracy" title="DeBracy"><img alt="DeBracy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nTIWP6SSS5BV3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeBracy">DeBracy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319052/#Comment_319052" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-06T08:38:25+00:00" title="April  6, 2011  8:38AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This might be somewhat tangential but it's the first thing I thought about when I saw this thread, and now with the mentioning of "invocation" I can't help but bring it up.<br/><br/>In the book "A Map of Nowhere" by Gillian Cross three kids play some form of roleplaying game together. It's a pretty abstract dungeon-crawly affair where the players try to outsmart the GM (one of the player\u2019s sister). Sounds pretty normal right? <br/><br/>It certainly would be if it wasn't for the fact that the players more or less summon the GM at the start of the game. When they enter the room it's already darkened, and the GM's dressed up in an old elegant dress which gives her an air of mystery when she steps out of the closet (!).

Invocations! <br/><br/>On the other, I wonder if we've taken an interesting technique and storygamed it out of existence. To some extent, certainly, the opening monologue is about <i>one person</i> who focusses the session. It's clearly about authority. As in Anders example, there's a sense of anointing: the players invest their authority in the GM, who performs the opening ritual for them.<br/><br/>I wonder (as I often do) whether, because of indie GMphobia, we're afraid to consider the power of investing authority (and ritual) in one person.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_319090">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319090/#Comment_319090" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-06T10:23:44+00:00" title="April  6, 2011 10:23AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 6, 2011 10:27AM by Judd.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, Graham, we are quaking with fear and we are expressing that fear by saying that we have used this technique and to good effect.<br/><br/>Do you need a simulationism-is-okay hug, Graham?

As such, I carefully choose an "opening credits" and "closing credits" song.<br/><br/>Sometimes I start with something before the opening credits and other times I start of right with the theme song and frame the first scene after that.<br/><br/>I like to choose obscure but hip songs that strongly reflect the themes in the game. My current game is based on fairy tales. So my opening credits song is Fairy Tale by Melodies From Our Nameless Hearts and the closer is Happily Ever After by He Is We. I keep them on a playlist on Playlist.com. <a href="http://www.playlist.com/playlist/21106900491" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.playlist.com/playlist/21106900491</a><br/><br/>(I don't play the whole song. They both have a break about halfway in them, which is where a TV show would cut them anyway, so that's where I cut.)<br/><br/>Also, in the last session, I started off by reading part of a fairy tale story. It was the story they were going to be playing out part of. And I framed it as the story being told to one of the characters by Baba Yaga when she was younger. Because part of the concept of the game world is that fairy tale stories are both history and divination - they are things that have happened and will happen again, though the details change each time.<br/><br/>The players really liked it, and I'll be doing that again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_319485">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/graypawn" title="graypawn"><img alt="graypawn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3334/3586780205_8c6584252f_o.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/graypawn">graypawn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319485/#Comment_319485" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-07T21:33:16+00:00" title="April  7, 2011  9:33PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 7, 2011 9:35PM by graypawn.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DeBracy</cite>Sounds really cool, Andrew!

The 'Crux Items,' as they came to be known, grew organically.  First were the 'sliderstones' which three of us (the only three playing at first) bought from a vending machine on a roadtrip, somewhere in the frightening parts of northern Arkansas.  It was just a Bridge to Tarabithia thing.  But it worked.  Then we started riffing on the idea, and that became Silver's Candle, skeleton keys, a magic bracelet, a chesspiece, you name it.  Each was a little thing that said 'i'm going there.'  Then, inevitably, we found ourselves with some time to game, a game to play, and everyone had forgotten their Crux Item.  So i played a song to 'crux us in.'  I started narrating "The other side of this song smells like garbage..."  One of the players (it was actually his first game with us) loved it.  And Cruxing In by Song became a Thing.<br/><br/>All that's to say, i dunno.  I wish i did, but we were making it up as we went along.  Probably just ask your players what they think would be a cool 'key' to the gameworld...It's become a fun exploration for us.  All i know is that, to me, the best part of the ritual happened when we had so many people being invited into the game that we made it a 'tradition' that your first GM for the game provided you with a 'temporary' Crux Item.  After you'd been at least once you were allowed to make your own.  Which i loved because i have a handful of little crafted things that i've given away to people as they joined, and i've been given other little things by friends that invited me back, into their own space in the gameworld.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_319659">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319659/#Comment_319659" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-08T12:12:32+00:00" title="April  8, 2011 12:12PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So. watching this Zardoz movie.  The opening monologue is almost sexy enough to use or adapt for a game...<br/><br/>"I am Arthur Frayn, and I am Zardoz. I have lived three hundred years, and I long to die. But death is no longer possible. I am immortal. I present now my story, full of mystery and intrigue - rich in irony, and most satirical. It is set deep in a possible future, so none of these events have yet occurred, but they *may.* Be warned, lest you end as I. In this tale, I am a fake god by occupation - and a magician, by inclination. Merlin is *my* hero! I am the puppet master. I manipulate many of the characters and events you will see. But *I* am invented, too, for your entertainment - and amusement. And you, poor creatures, who conjured *you* out of the clay? Is God in show business too? "<br/><br/>A bit heavy handed, but it's delivered with surprising style.<br/><br/>Or the infamous, from The Libertine,<br/><br/>"Allow me to be frank at the commencement. You will not like me. The gentlemen will be envious and the ladies will be repelled. You will not like me now and you will like me a good deal less as we go on. Ladies, an announcement: I am up for it, all the time. That is not a boast or an opinion, it is bone hard medical fact. I put it round you know. And you will watch me putting it round and sigh for it. Don't. It is a deal of trouble for you and you are better off watching and drawing your conclusions from a distance than you would be if I got my tarse up your petticoats. Gentlemen. Do not despair, I am up for that as well. And the same warning applies. Still your cheesy erections till I have had my say. But later when you shag - and later you will shag, I shall expect it of you and I will know if you have let me down - I wish you to shag with my homuncular image rattling in your gonads. Feel how it was for me, how it is for me and ponder. 'Was that shudder the same shudder he sensed? Did he know something more profound? Or is there some wall of wretchedness that we all batter with our heads at that shining, livelong moment. That is it. That is my prologue, nothing in rhyme, no protestations of modesty, you were not expecting that I hope. I am John Wilmot, Second Earl of Rochester and I do not want you to like me.

The fact that I have to pause for a moment to think through what exactly I'm going to say probably helps add that extra bit of "now we're starting".<br/><br/>It's also the part of the game that gives me the most stage fright. I'm feeling it a bit right now, as I type. Weird, huh?<br/><br/>Conversely, the ritual opening of Polaris or A Flower for Mara provides the same sense of "opening" without the stage fright.
