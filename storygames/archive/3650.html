I don't know that they'll be regular updates, but I want to get something going. <br/><br/>I have previously used Skype and a cobbled-together suite of software to record on it. I used a $40 headphone/mic thingy. It's nothing special -- basically a video gamer's headphone/chat set.<br/><br/>So, I'd like some suggestions. <br/><br/>1) What technology do you use and/or recommend? I found an article that suggests a decent mic ($50 at least), a power source and a mixing board. None of which I know too much about. Is this even necessary, especially if I'll be doing talking mainly over Skype or something comparable? (i.e. won't be doing much in the way of local interviews at my computer).<br/><br/>2) Can you recommend something for recording at conventions? What works? Handhelds?

(i.e. won't be doing much in the way of local interviews at my computer).</blockquote>\nWhat I have is a mixing board, two mics, a USB audio bridge &amp; a laptop.  Really, all this is way overkill for what I normally do, and you can totally get away with doing a podcast with the headset you have -- especially if you're not sure how much money you want to throw into this.<br/><br/>If you want to get into convention recording, it gets more complicated from my understanding, since you'll want multiple mics, and that's where you'll need a mixing board and something beyond gaming headsets.\n<blockquote>2) Can you recommend something for recording at conventions? What works? Handhelds? Portable "studios"?</blockquote>\nPaul Tevis is fond of his iRiver.  I have my laptop &amp; board, but while it's portable it's not very mobile -- I can bring it with me and set up somewhere, but I can't roam with it.\n<blockquote>3) What have you found to be the best online telephony service? Is Skype indeed the way to go?</blockquote>\nI pretty much just use Skype for Master Plan\n<blockquote>4) Do you have any technical advice on recording and/or editing? Resources?</blockquote>\nLoads, but no one point sticks out as a quick answer.  Audacity is free on the PC, and I hear Mac folks use GarageBand, so the entry level for editing software is really low.\n<blockquote>5) What do you find makes your podcast work well? Interviews? Reviews? Regularity? I'd love to hear some top suggestions of how to make your content compelling.</blockquote>\nWithout getting too deep (as I'm prone to elsewhere) into the topic, it's all about knowing who your target audience is.  My target audience enjoy the interviews, but they also want me to keep talking about my own experiences &amp; efforts.  I can give you top suggestions for how to make your content compelling to my audience, but I don't know how much that'll help you.<br/><br/>Regularity is something my listeners have complained about -- Master Plan doesn't come out regularly enough.  It comes out when I have time to make it, and I'm trying to make more time, but life has a way of interrupting those plans.<br/><br/>I am firmly not a review podcast, because that's not the intent of my show.  When it comes to the interviews, I try to keep them about the subject of game design, usually about one or two specific topics, and edit heavily to keep things going.  The interviews might drift around some, but the end result is (ideally) something focused.<br/><br/>I'll also say that working to keep my show under 30 minutes is a big deal, and most folks seem to like it.  The only complaints I get on that front is "I wish you'd go longer so you could go into more detail."  My philosophy on podcasting is:  Leave the audience wanting more is better than leaving them wanting less.<br/><br/>I should also point out that, if you can get away from the booth for some of them, there will be some podcaster panels at GenCon on Friday &amp; Saturday.  I'm on some of the ones on Friday.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_82025">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82025/#Comment_82025" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-18T11:31:41+00:00" title="July 18, 2007 11:31AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Jason and Ryan.

If you're using Skype, 'Okay' is about as good as you can hope for. If you're happy with how you sound, the $40 headset is fine. Audacity is also available for the Mac, if you don't want to be locked into Apple's system (GarageBand has been super-reliable and easy to use, so I stick with it).<br><br>Daniel: I've never recorded a game, so I don't really know. Plunking a dedicated microphone in front of everyone probably isn't an option (it's not for us, not least of which because it would be annoying). You need a omnidirectional mic, but cheap ones sound like crap, just recording a room. I honestly don't know. If a recorder outputs an audio file, you can import it into GarageBand. Maybe rent some wireless lavaliers and a mixing board?<br/><br/>Ryan: It's fine if you want to share our conversation. Oh! I have a mic suggestion for you, that will solve your background noise problems. The Sterling Audio ST-55 has -10db roll-off switch. Basically when you turn it on, the microphone ignores soft background noise. You sacrifice a little bit of detail, but it removes a lot of 'mung' from the background. In addition, the ST-55 is a great-sounding mic. Maybe a little more spendy than you want, but I found one used, and I really love it.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_82064">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82064/#Comment_82064" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-18T13:25:32+00:00" title="July 18, 2007  1:25PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Remi</cite>The Sterling Audio ST-55</blockquote>\nI'm not an audiophile and was skeptical, but there is a huge difference to audio quality between this and the cheaper mics.

I'm getting going myself, having just released my fifth podcast -- I used to do college radio, but that was only as a DJ, so I'm learning a whole lot of new stuff with production.<br/><br/>I'd definitely be interested to hear what you did to diagnose where your line noise came from.<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/><br/>- Ryan\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Remi</cite>Hey Ryan,<br/>Pretty much I was getting lots of noise from one of my two remaining inputs on my mixer. I tried all three mics (which were quiet on the other line) on the input and ended up getting the same noise from each one. So it's the mixer.<br/><br/>If you're asking how to get rid of line noise? For me the answer is to get a mixer that has XLR inputs. That should help a lot. Making those the only analog connection in my setup should help as well. I'm looking at a Alesis 8-channel USB mixer for this purpose.<br/><br/>Does that help? Seriously, unless you're planning on buying a multi-thousand dollar condenser, there's no reason to sink a fortune into equipment. You're going to end up putting it up as a low-quality mp3, anyway, so just record in a relatively quiet room, with no fans blowing on your mic and you should be fine. I think where people run into problems is that they have so much background noise and such that it makes it difficult to hear them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Macklin</cite>Remi,<br/><br/>I've got a Behringer Eurorack MXB1002 mixer an am using my girlfriend's AKG mic with XLR input.

Only later did I find out that he's recording in a dramatically different space than I am and exactly how much that matters, as I can't use my Marshall MXL 990's in my home without picking up the nearby elevated freeway (which is eye-level and visible from balcony).  The directionals work just fine though.<br/><br/>It does help.  I hadn't thought about testing the inputs on my mixer.  I've been focused on the sound card or the line from the mixer being the problem.  I do have some grander plans beyond just podcasting, and I'm enjoying getting back into a A/V hobby.<br/><br/>Thank you!<br/><br/>- Ryan</blockquote>\nAnd a month later, I got two <a href="http://www.audio-technica.com/cms/wired_mics/cd45922e09b78f2c/index.html" rel="nofollow">Audio Technica ATM410s</a>.

Should I move anytime soon (which is unlikely), this will factor into choosing my next place, because I love what people are able to pull off with those mics.<br/><br/>Edit: And I also have to say that they aren't really "beginner's" mics.

The whole idea with podcasting is "Hey, you're the producer, director, host, interviewed, writer, editor, promoter, public relations, all that jazz," and such books help give an overview into all those topics.<br/><br/>But they can get dated, as technology rapidly increases and understanding of the media increases.  And not every part of the book will be applicable -- certainly I doubt any of us will get use out of the chapters regarding getting sponsors.  I checked out the one I mentioned from the library, so it was definitely worth the money.  The one Clyde suggested I bought off of Amazon, and it had generally the same content (if memory serves), so for $17 it wasn't too bad.  I partly bought it so I could loan it out in case local folks I knew were interested.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_82134">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clyde%20L.%20Rhoer" title="Clyde L.

Other than that, I use nothing more than the hardware I already had and free software to record, edit, and produce the Godzilla Gaming Podcast. I probably owe it to everyone listening to the show to get some better gear, but what I've got works and that's all I really need it to do.

If you're recording with Skype, I recommend spending the $30 or so to get Skype Recorder, which also made my interview recording headaches go away.\n<blockquote>4) Do you have any technical advice on recording and/or editing? Resources?</blockquote>\nSee previous sources cited. There is a hell of a lot more advice and technical know-how (not to mention equipment and software) for podcasting than there was just two years ago. When I started GGP in January last year, I was stumbling in the dark, but it's much easier now.\n<blockquote>5) What do you find makes your podcast work well? Interviews? Reviews? Regularity? I'd love to hear some top suggestions of how to make your content compelling.</blockquote>\nI'd have to say it's the chemistry I have with my podcasting partner, Cam. I really appreciate the work solo podcasters like Paul Tevis, Ryan Macklin, and Sam Chupp do, because going solo and making it interesting is very hard to pull off. Our approach is to try and make it like an open discussion, even though we can't talk to our listeners in realtime. What we do on air is just us, with no fancy script (though we do use an outline of the segments, and points we want to bring up).<br/><br/>Doing a general gaming advice show is pretty tough I think - the gaming audience that listens to podcasts is very savvy, and there are a lot of shows that already do general advice. On the GGP, Cam and I just try to talk about what interests us about what we're doing, some gaming self-analysis, and simply discussing what's on our minds about the games we play. This seems to be a big part of the appeal of the show. We do occasional interviews, but the core of our show is two lifelong gamers talking about games. If we went away from that, we wouldn't have anything.<br/><br/>We try as much as we can to bring our "international" perspective into things (how much we actually can do that is another matter, but!) Cam is from Australia, I'm from the States, and we both lived in Japan for many years (Cam is still there). Aside from this giving us a rather unique segment (Gaming in J-Land, aka, Mike and Cam Eat Something Weird On Air...) I hope it helps color our commentary somewhat.<br/><br/>As for reviews, our twist is that we look at "old" (10 years +) games and new story games - the "bookends" so to speak. This lets us look at where the hobby we love has come from and where it's going.<br/><br/>I guess what I'm saying is, look at your assets and figure out what you have that is unique, and work with that. You (Matt) have done game design and self publishing , so that's one thing (two things!) You did Dust Devils, and that's another. I don't know what else you might have up your sleeve but those first two sound like something I'd like to hear about!<br/><br/>As far timing goes, set a schedule you are comfortable with. We do a monthly, 90-minute show. If we tried for once a week or even every other week we couldn't do it. Our schedules just don't allow it and frankly, I don't think we could keep it fresh doing it every week. But others do, so it's a question of what you've got and are willing to give. At any rate, our listeners seem satisfied with our show length, and given the monthly schedule, I think that's just fine. Most will tell you if the content is quality, they don't care much how long the show is.<br/><br/>The main thing is, have fun! Don't sweat the format, make your own. You've got something to say and podcasting is great way to bring other people into your conversation!<br/><br/>If you take the podcasting plunge, good luck! Looking forward to your show!<br/><br/>Now, back to editing our Luke Crane special show! ;-)                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_82162">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82162/#Comment_82162" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-18T23:07:56+00:00" title="July 18, 2007 11:07PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man, Mike, that's a fountain of good stuff.

What is it that you like about Skype Recorder, Mike?<br/><br/>I don't use a lot of the features of PowerGramo, but it does start automatically for me, the sound quality is decent, it records the two sides of the conversation as separate tracks, and so far hasn't missed a beat when recording a long (couple hours or so) conversation.\n<blockquote>You can spend a lot or a little. You can do a great podcast either way. :-)</blockquote>\nThere is much wisdom here.  Frankly, at the end of the day, you compressing your audio into an MP3 that doesn't need to be high bitrate.  At a music shop, one guy tried to sell me on a $300 or $400 mic, because I mentioned podcasting.  He said it was the mic "you see people on the news use."  It took a lot to not just laugh in his face (not out of rudeness, but out of utter humorous absurdity) because that $300+ artifact of awesome would be totally going to waste if I used it for my show.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Montesa</cite>I really appreciate the work solo podcasters like Paul Tevis, Ryan Macklin, and Sam Chupp do, because going solo and making it interesting is very hard to pull off.</blockquote>\nThanks, Mike!  Yeah, it really can be, which is another reason I stick to my 30 minute limit and separate my show.  The plus side of solo podcasting is having fewer people to coordinate with when it comes to sitting down and doing a show -- a friend of mine initially was interested in co-hosting on Master Plan, and I thought about it, but then it meant I could only record when we were both available.  The the minus, like Mike says, it takes a lot of work to keep one voice interesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_82163">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa" title="Mike Montesa"><img alt="Mike Montesa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2395/2470886071_32bd4c6f2f.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa">Mike Montesa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82163/#Comment_82163" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-18T23:49:08+00:00" title="July 18, 2007 11:49PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Macklin</cite>Man, Mike, that's a fountain of good stuff.

It starts up with Skype, works with the video conferencing, and you can set it to begin recording when you start a call or start it manually. In a word, it's simple and it works (I guess that's more than a word...)\n<blockquote><br/> because that $300+ artifact of awesome would be totally going to waste if I used it for my show.</blockquote>\nThat's what usually stops me reaching for my wallet when I see gear like that at the store.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_82165">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa" title="Mike Montesa"><img alt="Mike Montesa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2395/2470886071_32bd4c6f2f.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa">Mike Montesa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82165/#Comment_82165" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-19T00:35:16+00:00" title="July 19, 2007 12:35AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I started, I too read through many posts that got into audiophile territory. Once the model numbers started flying around (and no slight to those of you that can sling 'em) I was lost. I wanted to know, "How do I do a frikkin' podcast??"<br/><br/>The steps to hearing yourself yammering from your computer speakers are fairly straightforward:<br/><br/>Pre-production<br/><br/>1. Conceptualize your show. Decide what you're on about, how long it'll be, how often you'll put it out, any themes, features, interviews, etc.<br/><br/>2. Outline or script what you want to talk about (I prefer a loose outline).<br/><br/>3. Get some recording software for your computer. I use Audacity (for editing as well, but Garage Band can do the same things and the interface is better). Set it up so you can record yourself.<br/><br/>4. Plug in and set up your mike(s) to run with your recording software (or worry not if the mike is built in). Initially, things like bit rates and such will confuse the hell out of you (they still confuse me). Don't sweat 'em the first time around, just get the damned thing recording!<br/><br/>Recording<br/><br/>5. Press record. Talk. Enjoy yourself. Press pause occasionally and take a break and get your bearings. Don't worry about being perfect - that's what editing is for! I find a good segment length is 10 - 15 minutes. If you go longer than this, break it up (in post) with a bumper or promo at the halfway point of the segment.<br/><br/>Post-Production<br/><br/>6. If your show files are not automatically recorded as MP3 files, convert them. Most audio software can do this. Audacity saves files as it's own file type, and you must convert them to MP3 (or WAV files).<br/><br/>7. Edit - Put the files into your editing software and get to work. I go through and take out all the "um's," "ah's" stuttering, blabbering, car noises, etc. Some people don't - it's up to you (but I do appreciate a smooth cut). Cut out extraneous bits, stuff that isn't immediate to the conversation can go, tangential blathering can go - you can save an average of 10-15% (or more) of the show's total time by selective editing.<br/><br/>8. Assemble the show - I use Garage Band because it has all the nifty FX and it's easy to drop segments in and move them around.<br/><br/>9. Intro and outro music - Download some royalty-free music somewhere (there's a lot out there for podcasters) and cut it into an intro and outro file. You can mix voice tracks into it to make an appropriate intro. Save this file and reuse/refine it.<br/><br/>10. Download some fellow podcasters bumpers and promos. Hit their websites or the Goblin Broadcast Network for these. Drop these into your podcast between segments.<br/><br/>11. If you've cut the show together with something like Garage Band, you create a final mixdown (that combines all your various segments, bumpers, FX, and music into a single track). Garage Band imports this directly to iTunes, and once it's there (in iTunes), you need to convert the file to MP3 again. When finished you've got your show.<br/><br/>Release<br/><br/>12. If you've made it this far and have a completed show, you need hosting. Libsyn is my recommendation. For $5/month, you get up to 100mb of storage, unlimited archive space, a blog for the show, and support. It's set up specifically for podcasting and it is very simple to use.<br/><br/>13. Post your show - Posting to Libsyn is easy. Include your show notes on the blog provided.<br/><br/>14. Voila - You're a podcaster!<br/><br/>Of course, if you want you can make a website and forum for your show and what have you, but these are the basic steps to simply getting a show out there. Flashy podcasting gear and all that are for later!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_82189">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clyde%20L.%20Rhoer" title="Clyde L.

I think Libsyn is a great service, so don't think I'm downing them. There are some points to consider though.<br/>\n<br/>\nPresently RPG podcasting has a small audience, from what I can figure from taking a comment from here and a comment from there and putting it together. I don't think anyone is over 2000 listeners and I think that 1000 is more likely for larger podcasts. I knew from the beginning that I wanted to do longer podcasts, and I've been using site5.com for my webhosting in the past. They don't advertise so they are able to take the savings and put it to lowering the cost of their plans or improving their service. For $5 a month you can get 5 terrabytes of traffic a month, and enough storage space that I don't even remember how much it is. This lets you get your domain name, and host your stuff on your domain so your links will advertise you and not libsyn. Also you can use the blogging software you like for instance wordpress. It's also cheaper than Libsyn this way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI encode my mp3's at 128 khz so my filesize is large. It's about 50 MB an hour at that compression. So 5 TB divided by 50 MB = @ 1,000,000 downloads a month, of an hour long show. Another way to look at it is... if I had a thousand listeners I could do 1,000 one hour shows at 128 khz a month. The most listened to show I've had has approached a thousand over several months, so for me 5 terrabytes is effectively unlimited bandwidth. You would need to get an audience in the 50,000 to 100,000 range before you started pushing your luck. Using site5 I also have the advantage of controlling all my shit. I'm lazy so I don't take as much advantage of that as I could, but the choice is there. They also have something called fantastico to auto setup various website software like blogs, forums, wikis, etc. They also keep on top of new versions, at least with wordpress, which makes keeping your software secure pretty easy if you aren't technically inclined.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know this sounds like a commercial, but I've been happy with my service so far, and I've been pushing 30 to 60 GB a month and haven't noticed any problems yet. I also am not involved with the company and make no money off recommendations. Just offering an alternative.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso as a sidenote for Matt, I listened to your Mattcast from a year or two ago, about a week or two ago, and that seemed acceptable for sound quality. I would listen if the content was good.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_82193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82193/#Comment_82193" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-19T06:35:36+00:00" title="July 19, 2007  6:35AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm going to disagree with one of Mike's suggestions. Converting to an MP3 should be your last step, after editing. If you're outputting your sound to a different program, output a lossless (AIF, WAV) format and then import it. If you convert to MP3 and then import the sound file into another editing program, you're going to lose some sound quality as that program is probably going to convert the file BACK into a lossless format, and not edit the mp3 directly. This means you are compressing a file twice. This isn't the end of the world, but it isn't optimal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_82201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clyde%20L.%20Rhoer" title="Clyde L.

I'm planning to get Marantz PMD 660 ($400), PMD 670 ($500), or PMD 671 ($600), depending on what I can afford, plus a Sennheiser MD-46 microphone. This is overkill. The Gamemaster show uses a Zoom H-4 ($250) The main difference besides maybe the quality of the hardware, if that is very different, is that the Marantz units use CF cards and are a bit bulkier with more batteries, but only does two microphones. The Zoom uses smaller SD cards, but Mario from the Gamemaster show told me it will accept 4 microphones. It also can be held in the palm of your hand. It sounds like it has less recording time from batteries than the Marantz does.<br><br/>Other folks use I-Rivers with no microphone other than the built in mic. Some like the Sons of Kryos at last years Gen con use an ipod with a microphone attached.\n<blockquote>3) What have you found to be the best online telephony service?

Resources?</blockquote>\nBesides what was covered above, a wire pop guard can be a good way to block a guest from getting too close to a microphone and give them a proper idea of how far away to speak from. Cardiod microphones like my AT2020's and guests in chairs that swivel and have wheels don't mix well. Always do a recording check and playback to make sure everything is working and you won't lose the Game Design seminar at Origins like I did. Then you won't have to pound yourself in the head because lots of people gave you great advice for your stuck game, and much of it got lost to the ether.\n<blockquote>5) What do you find makes your podcast work well?

I'll assume you mean attracts listeners when you say works well. Correct me if I'm wrong. <br/><br/>Interviews. People love them. I get 2 to 4 times as large an audience when I do interviews. Some of that is due to increased advertising I do, but I don't think all of it is. I advertise for guests, for my solo stuff I am expecting only to get people who are really interested in theory and design which is a smaller audience.                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_82219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82219/#Comment_82219" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-19T08:22:45+00:00" title="July 19, 2007  8:22AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Some like the Sons of Kryos at last years Gen con use an ipod with a microphone attached.</blockquote>\nI have one of these.

Correct me if I'm wrong.<br/><br/>As a listener, I can tell the number one way how you can to attract me to your podcast:  Have other podcasters talk about your podcast.  <br/><br/>Note that this is not send other podcasters promos for your podcast.  As a listener, I absolutely hate promos for other podcasts -- the volume level seems to always be off from the main podcast; there's no standard length for promos, so I have no idea if I'm waiting for fifteen seconds or two minutes until I can resume listening to the podcast I wanted to listen to; and I listen to podcasts in chunks on cross-country trips.  That last one means if I keep hearing your ninety second commercial ten times on a trip across the state -- especially if it's a comedy skit -- I'm going to wind up disliking your podcast without ever listening to it.<br/><br/>When Podcast X mentions your podcast, I'm probably going to check out your podcast -- I've taken the time to listen to Podcast X and I respect the opinions of those podcasters.  When Podcast X includes a promo for your podcast, I'm thinking that the ad is just a bit of promocrap I have to get through to get back to Podcast X.  It's keeping me from listening to the content I want.

Take a listen to how Have Games, Will Travel is structured:  short segments with short bumpers.  If you've got two or more hosts, the show can be longer without your audience's interest waning. <br/><br/>Take a look at a month's worth of a serialized syndicated comic strip like For Better or For Worse.  You'll see that the characters in the strip -- even if sitting in the same coffee shop having the same conversation -- use each other's names much more often than if that was an actual conversation.   The constant use of names lets the first time and casual reader know who is whom in a comic strip.<br/><br/>Just like this comic strip example, if you've got multiple hosts in your podcast, you want to make certain you keep using your co-host's name in conversation.  Far too many hour-long podcasts introduce multiple co-hosts at the beginning of the show, but because the hosts know each other and can look at one another when speaking, they don't use their names after the intro.  When a listener e-mails back and wants to discuss something said on your podcast, knowing who's who really helps the listener.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_82300">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82300/#Comment_82300" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-19T12:21:54+00:00" title="July 19, 2007 12:21PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thomas D</cite>As a listener, I absolutely hate promos for other podcasts -- the volume level seems to always be off from the main podcast; there's no standard length for promos, so I have no idea if I'm waiting for fifteen seconds or two minutes until I can resume listening to the podcast I wanted to listen to;</blockquote>\nAs a podcaster, I share your complaints about people not managing their bumps correctly, and I try to avoid that in my own.

Your comments are some of the reasons I don't use bumpers and why you're unlikely to hear one for my show. Anyone who plays one has taken advantage of my creative commons license and I have nothing to do with it. I'm thankful, but they won't be made through my action or request. I also simply don't like the way they sound. I hate radio, and I hate my cultures short attention span.<br/><br/>The reason you hear so many promos is they are used for advertising in a scratch my back, I'll scratch yours, sort of fashion. This is why you're unlikely to hear one for my show as I have been clear I'm not using them. It's not all about scratching backs, the community is trying to be supportive too. Interestingly my show is exceeding my initial expectations without promos.<br/><br/>I also think telling someone about shows is a good way to go, which is why I've mentioned many of the RPG podcasts I listen to.<br/><br/>I say half validate, as I don't have segments and typically go on for 20 to 30 minutes by myself, or for 45 minutes to 2 hours for an interview. 2 hours isn't some self enforced limit, it's just been a function of how much people talk and the time I have before I need to leave. I'm hoping I might get a interview to hit three hours at Gen Con, but we'll see. Strangely I haven't heard any complaints about the length of my shows only ebullient praise. (technically I've heard one complaint due to dial up) It makes me wonder if the idea of breaking stuff up is another canard brought over from the emulation of radio, or if folks turn off and don't stop by my website to call me stupid. Personally I have to stop listening to podcasts every night due to forced break schedules, and I have no trouble picking them back up later, even if later is tomorrow, or after the weekend.<br/><br/><b>Hi Ryan,</b><br/><br/>I think the first three questions are absolutely great and solidly endorse them.

We have a set of vintage 70\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Sony condenser studio mics running through a Mackie USB audio interface outputting into Rogue Amoeba's Hijack Pro on a Power Mac. We prefer to have our guests actually join us in the studio (where we can stuff them at "<a href="http://www.boakland.com" rel="nofollow">B</a>" and then offer them green room-style hospitality) for audio quality purposes.

We've also have very good results with an iPod kitting with iTalk for non-studio interviews and shows.  The file is saved and transfered to me for the next step.<br/><br/>For the post-production work, I use Garage band and iTunes running on my MacBook. I use a standard template I've built with the show intro and exit music, and then pull in the content.  I edit the show content itself into it, and run through it in "native" format, making any edits there. Once done, I'll render it out to m4a, import into iTunes and reburn it as an mp3, which I then upload to our server using fetch.<br/><br/>For completeness sake, I'll also note that our theme song(s) were written and performed by Finn Kisch and recorded and mixed on a MacBook using a Yamaha 01X board, Digital Performer 5.1 and Reason 3. <br/><br/>In general, with editing, mastering, show notes and links, and posting, I find post-production runs about 2 hours per show, give or take.  My experience with Garage band has been mixed - it works, but lordy, is it ever buggy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_82406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82406/#Comment_82406" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-19T21:48:57+00:00" title="July 19, 2007  9:48PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: 1000buffalo</cite>My experience with Garage band has been mixed - it works, but lordy, is it ever buggy.</blockquote>\nSame with Audacity, for those who might read the above and think "Oh, I'll try Audacity then."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_82446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clyde%20L.%20Rhoer" title="Clyde L.

I get into problems with I start hitting around a dozen tracks or so: the window drawing code starts to function for totally crap, which requires me to restart the program every so often -- annoying, since I lose my place in editing.  There are also plenty of little bugs here and there in the UI.  I'd also had it crash on me several times, and I'm not a fan of how it'll include muted tracks when doing a mix down to export.<br/><br/>One reason to love Adobe Audition (and other programs that to this): you can group tracks together, so that if you move one, the rest move along with it.  Also, you can have multiple sound segments on the same track.  There are a few things that feel less intuitive than using Audacity, but I'm sure I'll get over them when I make the switch.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_82484">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82484/#Comment_82484" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-20T10:46:57+00:00" title="July 20, 2007 10:46AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt, I just listened to your first episode.
