And I hope you agree.<br/><br/>I think that this, in fact, the sort of thing that would get new blood, especially Girly Narrativist Yingers (as opposed to Macho Narrativist Yangers, discussed in jest at length on www.lumpley.com) into the hobby.<br/><br/>Now, I am not afraid of my capacity to approach girls about this Cool Thing:  Now that I have accepted that I will always be afraid of staring into places other than their eyes and babbling about stupid minutiae like (frexample) hit points and armor class, I am paradoxically much more likely to look them in the eye and have normal, interesting conversations with them.<br/><br/>What I am afraid of is presenting them with the core concepts of one of those are pee gee thingummies without confusing them and hence, boring them to tears.<br/><br/>How does one (by which I mean, "how do you") present a storytelling game to people who have no concept of "storytelling game?"                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90995">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90995/#Comment_90995" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-28T09:37:04+00:00" title="August 28, 2007  9:37AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That is a pretty tough question and one I grappled with for a while.

I have recent experience with this which I have mentioned in another discussion.<br/><br/>Especially don't make this assumption if the people you're talking to are relatively young.  I imagine (but have no way of knowing as I'm not really old enough myself) that people who were teenagers or older during the D&amp;D boom and Satanism scare MAY have some rough idea of what an RPG is, but even then, it's probably not a good idea to make assumptions.<br/><br/>But seriously, in the last couple years there have been a few occasions when, for one reason or another, i found myself surrounded by a half-dozen or more blank-faced people asking me to explain what, exactly, is a role-playing game and does it have anything to do with sexual roleplaying.

"<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is actually a great point of entry for the right audience. Sexual roleplay and storygames are pretty much the same thing (!!!). I've been asked this exact question in the past, and my answer was "Yes, except instead of playing out a sexual story, we're telling an adventure story, or a mystery, or a romance. Or it can be a sex scene, if you want". In this case the person really took to the idea (of role playing, not of a sex scene).

I'm going to pretend to be Batman. You're going to Pretend to be Superman. One of us is an aggressive top, the other is a submissive bottom. We're going to create a scene where Batman dominates Superman (using Batmans "prep time" Trait and "kryptonite ring" item). We'll play out the scene, using in character dialog to narrate what happens. Will Superman submit to Batman? Will the fallout be an arguement, hardcore bat-sex or just a make out session? <br/>\n<br/>\nSeems like a good comparrison to me.

But still, for people who have NO direct experience with any kind of sexual roleplaying, the "LARP" variety is, I think, what they imagine.<br/><br/>I almost gave one of the friends of mine that was a bit confused about exactly what roleplaying was a very confused impression of the Roach.  I think I had mostly gotten her out of the idea of thinking it had anything to do with sexual roleplaying, but she still thought it involved actually acting things out.  I was telling her about the cards in the Roach, and how they tell you to do certain things... I mentioned the one that Commands a roach-slave to attempt to mate with someone... she thought I meant that the PLAYER was supposed the then try to have sex with the other PLAYER.  Whew.
