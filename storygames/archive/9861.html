HOWEVER, I have also read that the player who has won the power of narration after the card mechanics play out takes over the duties of narrating the conflict and its aftermath (which seems, to me, to contradict the concept of role-playing the conflict in accordance with the cards/stakes).<br/>\n<br/>\nIs the correct approach either of these? Neither? A combination?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_219257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219257/#Comment_219257" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-18T06:24:22+00:00" title="July 18, 2009  6:24AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The player with the power of narration, narrate the OUTCOME OF THE CONFLICT (and only that), with the usual limitations about what you can narrate in the game + the outcome is in part already decided by the resolution system.<br/><br/>So, for example, if you have a conflict where your character ("Bob") is fighting with another character ("Jack") and his intent (stakes) is "I want to win Jack's respect", and you win the stakes but lose narration, the player who won narration can narrate that (1) Bob win the fight, earning Jack's respect, or that (2) Jack win the fight, but Bob won his respect refusing to give up until the end, but he can't narrate that they become lovers, go to see a movie together or something like that. His "narrating power" ended when he narrated the conflict.<br/><br/>For a more general discussion about how to play PTA conflicts, my advice is reading <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=26413.0;topicseen" rel="nofollow">this thread</a>.

Sorry, I did misread the point of confusion...<br/><br/>Not only in PTA, but in almost every known narrativist game, the basic assumption is that everybody can talk at any time, giving suggestion, approving, cheering, etc (some games, like Dogs in the Vineyard, explicitly state this, other don't, but they have the same basic assumption). So  that "narrate the outcome" is not to be taken as a sort of "Shut up, I narrate!", but as a sort of "OK, everybody is talking and suggesting what happen, but the buck stop with me, I will be the one who choose", so for example a couple of characters could role-play the end of a talking conflict, with the narrator approval.<br/><br/>Most of the times, though, the outcome will be simply narrated (considering the suggestions of other people at the table), because usually is boring to role-play something you already know how it will end. After all, we are talking about a CONFLICT, non a SCENE (what do you role-play in most conflicts? "take that!!" "ahhhhh"?  ;-)<br/><br/>If you had posted the links to the contradictory statements I could have looked to see if they were really so contradictory, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_219269">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alan" title="Alan"><img alt="Alan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alan">Alan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219269/#Comment_219269" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-18T08:09:57+00:00" title="July 18, 2009  8:09AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's easier to think of high card narration as "the buck stops here."

He could say, "Okay guys, I'm out of ideas. How about you all throw out ideas or roleplay Joe earning Bob's approval and I'll guide things when I don't think they fit."
