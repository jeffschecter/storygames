I've always found them a bit lacking, mostly because they assumed that the GM had no interest of his own other than making the game fun for the players. Admittedly the booklet was called Laws of Good Game Mastering, and aimed primarily at GMs and not at players, but still. I felt that recognizing player types was only half the battle and for a good game the players would also need to know what kind of GM they were dealing with. Therefore I came up with these GM types, which you're all free to comment on or maybe even use to your advantage. <br/><br/>(Caveat: these GM-Types, much like those by Laws, aren't mutually exclusive of course. Many, if not most GMs fall somewhere in-between. And two GMs of the same kind aren't necessary alike. But I feel that they give you at least a rough idea, of what to expect and what is expected of you.)<br/><br/><b>The World Builder</b> has the goal of presenting an in-depth game world. It's not just some random place, where faceless NPCs wander around boring building. The game world has a history. The landscape is diverse and exciting. NPCs are part of a living, breathing world, that features a nearly endless amount of details. The World Builder is someone who draws on sourcebooks, non-fiction books and genre literature to have a wealth of information to make the game world come alive. You might call the game world his work of art, and the players his audience. <br/><i>Playstyle:</i> If you're playing with the World Builder you should take an interest in the setting and enjoy the complexity of the world. Especially when the World Builder uses a published setting, you'll find many references (and also some intentional contradictions) to pick up on. <br/><br/><b>The Duelist</b> is looking to compete with the players. He relishes playing the opposition to the characters. To him the game only starts when the group is fighting for something. That is not to say, that the Duelist only values combat. It's more that he's out to challenge the players. He loves victory to be hard-earned and have the players avoid defeat by a hair's breadth. But if the players display great tactical or strategic skill he will not deny them their well-deserved win. To him it goes without saying that his rule calls must be hard, but fair. Otherwise every victory is shallow and meaningless. <br/><i>Playstyle:</i> If you're playing with the Duelist you should never walk away from a challenge or base your decisions on anything other than tactics or strategy. With the Duelist you really have to work for everything you want, and have to prove yourself again and again. The Duelist's word may be law, but it would be an offence to his honour as a gamer to be biased and give anybody (let alone himself) an undeserved advantage.<br/><br/><b>The Plotmeister</b> considers himself the master of puppets, where all threads come together. He brings a complex and multilayered plot to the game, that the players have to unravel. To him the game world is not so much a place, as it is a web of cause and effect, with the characters caught in the middle. This can sometimes lead to even the simplest and most common plot hooks leading to a wide fog of surprising twists and unexpected developments. It's the Plotmeister's goal to constantly baffle and surprise the group, but doing so with plot developments which, looking back, are both consistent and sensible. <br/><i>Playstyle:</i> With the Plotmeister you should always pay attention to what happens and never lose track of even the smallest of details. He likes to give the players all the pieces of the puzzle, but it is up to them to piece together the big picture. As a player you should make notes and constantly exchange theories with each other. Never take any assumptions for granted and test them in the game first. <br/><br/><b>The Master of Ceremonies</b> is all about running a very atmospheric and immersive game. A game with the Master of Ceremonies should be unique and allow the players to dive into a whole new world. He likes to use all kinds of aids to make the game more vivid and real. He'd use things like lighting, background music, carefully crafted props and fancy handouts. It's also important to him that his NPCs talk and behave appropriately, that is to say.. authentically. To the Master of Ceremonies a roleplaying game is above all an experience and an act of escapism. <br/><i>Playstyle:</i> Gaming with the Master of Ceremonies requires the players to suspend their disbelief and keep heckling to a minimum. Nothing makes you more unpopular with him, than an out-of-character comment at the wrong time or an action that breaks the atmosphere. He especially disapproves of any kind of metagaming (which can include purely tactical/strategic play).  <br/><br/><b>The Actor</b> pours all his effort into the NPCs. He wants to present the players with many different NPCs with peculiar features or at least NPCs that are clearly and easily distinguishable. For the Actor the game world consists of characters with their preferences and dislikes, their strengths and quirks. To him roleplaying is all about character interaction. That of course requires the NPCs to have a consistent personality that is not subordinate to any rules or constraints of the game. The Actor wants the characters and their interaction with the players to be memorable. <br/><i>Playstyle:</i> To get along with the Actor your character needs to have character. Just like you have the opportunity to find out more about the NPCs and their motivation, the Actor wants the game to reveal more about the players' characters. Who are they? Why are they the way they are? Contradictory actions of a character must always stem from some inner conflict. On no account should it be because the player didn't care if his actions today are consistent with those from before. <br/><br/>(continued)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68198">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Georgios" title="Georgios"><img alt="Georgios" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Georgios">Georgios</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68198/#Comment_68198" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-10T03:40:02+00:00" title="May 10, 2007  3:40AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (cont.)<br/><br/><b>The Director</b> considers roleplaying a medium to create stories together. In order for this creation to be exciting and entertaining he draws from all available means of roleplaying games (e.g. adventure structure, great challenges, dramatic conflicts, etc.) but also from any and all narrative art he's familiar with (e.g. three act structure, genre rules, cinematic language, etc.). The Director is only interested in playing the \xe2\u20ac\u017eimportant stuff\xe2\u20ac\u0153. Actions that don't advance the plot or reveal something about the characters, he prefers to avoid or completely cut out of the game. <br/><i>Playstyle:</i> The Director expects the players to work on bringing their vision to the game. That means, they should actively look for situations where they can forward the story. In other words, they should take charge in specific situations and push the story into a new direction. The Director wants the players to surprise him.<br/><br/><b>The Provider</b> is the kind of GM, who doesn't have his own stake in the game. He has fun, because the other players have fun. Many Providers simply enjoy the company and are only GMing because nobody else wants to do it. The adventure is often made up of the player's preferences and he implements them according to the rules and to the best of his abilities. He's also willing to give the players more power, if that would increase the player's enjoyment of the game. The Provider feels obliged to meet the player's expectations halfway. <br/><i>Playstyle:</i> It doesn't take much to get along with the Provider. It's one of the reasons why most players consider him the best kind of GM. But there are two things, with which any group can push him away. As a player you must have at least a general idea of what you enjoy in a roleplaying game. Nothing is more frustrating for a Provider than players who claim to like one thing, but in reality want something completely different. Additionally, the Provider \xe2\u20ac\u201c more than any of the other types of GM \xe2\u20ac\u201c needs confirmation that the game was fun. A group that doesn't regularly tell him that he did a good job and they enjoyed themselves in his game, is practically chasing him towards burnout.<br/><br/>I've tried phrasing the descriptions as positively or objectively as I could. There are of course many negative variants of those GM Types. The Duelist can come across as a Killer GM, if the group isn't actively pushing back. Some Plotmeisters are too lazy to put the necessary work and care into adventure preperation, run each of their games by the seat of their pants and try to convince the players that everything that happened was planned. The World Builder might get lost in his creation and bore the players with his endless monologues and excessive descriptions of random stuff. The important thing is that all these are flawed approaches of the respective GM types, which shouldn't be dismissed because of them. <br/><br/>(The original text in German can be found <a href="url=http://georgiosp.blogspot.com/2007/05/georgios-spielleiter-typen.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_68370">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eldir" title="Eldir"><img alt="Eldir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i182.photobucket.com/albums/x208/loki_laufeysson/goplay_dotted_32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eldir">Eldir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68370/#Comment_68370" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-10T17:44:34+00:00" title="May 10, 2007  5:44PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ooh.. very interesting.

He's not really there to be part of a game, but to enjoy the company of the other players. He's a good GM in the same way that a butler is a good flatmate.

I'm not comfortable with equating this with being a Good GM. <br/><br/>My point is that GMs have an interest in the game as well. Not just other people's fun, but also playing a roleplaying game from the GM-side. I think of these types like a companion piece to Laws' Player Types. Because just like the GM can improve the game by taking the interests of his players into account, the players can do their part by recognizing what the GM is looking to get out of the game and try to work out some middle ground. <br/><br/>You'll note that all of the GM Types are dependent on the players' appropriate response. The playstyle section is about what I consider the type of response the GM is looking for.

Otherwise the game is just dysfunctional, in my experience.<br/><br/>I guess part of my objection stems from the fact that I see myself most in the Provider (let's put aside for the moment what this means about my ego <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/>, but my motivations for GMing are not like his and I don't think anyone would call me a casual gamer. Sometimes I GM for friends because I'm asked to, but the projects I'm most passionate about are the ones where I actively solicit players that suit the game regardless of how well I know them. Yet in every case I do the things the Provider does--I like story games in large part because they give players more power, and I work actively to bring everyone's input and desire into the campaign. Like the Provider I'm always hungry for validation and input, and I have a track record of getting along very well with players.<br/><br/>Still, when push comes to shove I'm all about making a good game, not pleasing the people. I often put my foot down when I think (say) a Raise or See is inadequate, and take players to task when I don't think they're putting in the effort. Maybe I'm a Provider/Taskmaster? Heh.<br/><br/>Of course, you never claimed the types were complete and exhaustive, nor that anyone would fit perfectly into one type. Still, I think there are enough requirements of a healthy group dynamic included in the Provider type to make him a kind of metatype.\n<blockquote>Sure thing. Go ahead.</blockquote>\nThanks.

It's not so much how people GM, but why. And how that affects the game itself. <br/><br/>You're right though in that "enjoying the company of your players" and "entertaining the group" aren't necessarily the same. But I feel that they are close enough, when it comes to GMing, that they both end up as Provider motivation. I should probably add something like: "Some Providers simply see themselves as entertainers or party-hosts, whose goal it is to make sure everyone has fun and to give the players what they want."<br/><br/>I think the Provider has as legitimate and sensible a motivation for running games as the other types do. But holding him up as the gold standard (or meta-type) of GMing is a bad idea.

I do like fasciliating cool stuff in my games and I do try to give the players what they want if it makes the game better for all involved, but to say that I don't have a stake in the game would be untrue. My ultimate responsability is to my own fun and I have no intention of running something that I don't enjoy, even if it would be something that all my players would love.<br/><br/>All in all, while I like the idea of different GM types and some of the above fit some of the "archetypes" I've seen/met, these specific types don't seem very helpfull to me.

In fact I thought from the time I read Laws' book that calling them player 'types' might be dangerously misleading. When I translated the player types on the blog I started by expressly saying these were actually better termed player desires or player motivations. (Or maybe I wrote that because it was originally in the book, I can't remember.) I feel the same way about the GM 'types,' which is why I find them so useful.\n<blockquote>I think the Provider has as legitimate and sensible a motivation for running games as the other types do.

And I think on some level I was pushing this so hard because I was burned by two previous GMs who were unwilling to compromise or share power, which made the game less fun for everyone. I guess I'm in a kind of backlash phase right now, going out of my way not to be what those guys were.<br/><br/>Your bringing up GM fun being secondary to player fun is also interesting, because it occurs that so much of the fun I get out of GMing <i>is</i> the fun my players are having. Just the thought of players having fun at my table gives me shivers of joy and a bolt of pure energy. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> Oh, I have my own sense of fun, particularly in drawing the players into a deeply political story with lots of human relationships and moral ambiguity. And it's a real downer if they don't turn out enjoying that kind of story. But by and large, I get so much fun from my players' fun that the idea of GM's fun being secondary didn't really cross my mind. <br/><br/>Now that I think about it, though, I can see how unhealthy it would be to put the GM last. I mean, wow, talk about your breeding ground for resentment. The players having fun at the GM's expense is as bad as the GM having fun at the players' expense, definitely. Like the Duellist and the Killer GM, the Worldbuilder and The Giant Bore, the Director and the Railroad Conductor, the Plotmeister and the Bumbling Illusionist... the Provider has a shadow self as well, the Martyr.

I can imagine a GM's sole source of enjoyment in an RPG stemming from their players' reaction to the game. That everything else in the game is merely a tool or a diversion from what it is that the GM enjoys most, that is helping/watching somebody else have fun. The GM's fun becomes secondary because it is contingent on the players having fun first; not because it can be overlooked or ignored. <br/><br/>It just seems to me that this is one of those unspoken pearls of "wisdom" that many gamers take for granted: that a GM must enjoy helping/watching the players have fun in order to be a good GM. I don't buy into that at all and I think that it's this kind of attitude towards GMs that most often leads to frustration, burn-out or plain resentment. Once a group recognizes that the GM can have an interest in the game that is not dependent on the player's fun, you might be able to work on a more stable and productive group dynamic in the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
