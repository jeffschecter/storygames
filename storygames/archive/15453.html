I don't like drawing them, I don't get any particular thrill out of using them, I don't feel all that enriched to have them available in a game.  Even the big, pretty maps like you used to get in old box sets leave me cold.  I can find them useful in specific situations, but if it's left up to me, there are no maps until one of those situations comes up, and then the map is discarded again.<br/><br/>But it's not just up to me; there are other people in our group, some of whom really have a hard time visualizing spatial relations or who prefer knowing exact positions where I'd be comfortable with loose descriptions, and so I'll gracefully go along with maps when they want 'em.  It's not my thing, but I can cope for the sake of everyone else's fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350457/#Comment_350457" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-04T15:17:57+00:00" title="December  4, 2011  3:17PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've seen too many games where one person says "I'm over by the door"...only to say "but I was near the crates" a few minutes later when it becomes a better strategic position.<br/><br/>For this reason I love maps, and even figures. <br/><br/>The map doesn't have to be elaborately drawn, and the "figures" can be scraps of paper.

As a GM in classical fantasy I find it better to frame the scene verbally, and demand action on the fly from my players. It makes for a faster game, and more fun, even though they may be acting on very sparse info sometimes.<br><br>It happens that I make a situational sketch anyway, if the game somehow demands it, but it is far between. <br/><br/>The reason I use situational maps so seldom, is that I do not believe in the so called "tactical" doctrine; that you need to see your characters in relation to enemies and friends, on a battle ground/grid, to make realistic decisions and have the fights play out to the satisfaction of everybody. The minute you put something down on a map like that, it stops being realistic, in my view, and makes the tactical element totally un-founded in any real experience of close fighting. The dynamic, flexible and wildly raging elements of a fight is lost, when your focus is drawn to some static plastic counters on a board. You may move them, but they won't move you.<br/><br/>What makes for realistic decisions, is that you (the character) are highly subjective in what you see and understand, and react on base of a fleeting impression of what goes on (beyond the simple fact that a fight is on). It also makes for a more realistic decision by you, if you are subject to the simple and effective workings of a living GM.<br/><br/>The GM using voice, mimics and body language to communicate the volatile situation, while also communicating danger, fear and rage, is far better. It makes for a better simulation of "me being in danger", in my experience. It makes the players focus on you, as a possible enemy. And that's a key; you (the GM) can easily portray a dangerous enemy; by standing up, leaning forward, talking loudly at your players, demanding action AT ONCE!!! (OR I WILL SMOTHER YOU ALL!!!). <br/><br/>"AT ONCE" is another key: by upping the tempo, bringing it into a frenzy of descriptions, actions and reactions, you end up with a way of doing fights that is far more efficient in spurring inspired and realistic interaction. The tactics applied by stressed players will be closer to real life battle tactics, as it will include some reminiscence of real life reactions and emotions. While a fight is all physical action on the surface of it, the inside of a fight is a churning psychodrama of adrenaline, and other fear and rage induced reactions. Tempo is key to making such things happen in the players.<br/><br/>And you don't get tempo with combat-sketches and plastic figures.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350497">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350497/#Comment_350497" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-05T00:06:38+00:00" title="December  5, 2011 12:06AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 5, 2011 12:07AM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I knew a map once that done killed a man.

But I do think certain maps can disrupt certain player's imagination when used at certain parts of the game.<br/><br/>The same is true for words. For some players, too many words, means to much specificity, which means limiting their imagination. But not always. It depends on the players. For some players, having a number next to a stat is more evocative than a verbal descriptor. Strength 8 out of 10 is more evocative for them than Amazing strength. <br/><br/>The amount of maps and the amount of verbal descriptions I use depends on what the players ask me. If the players ask me what something looks, feels, smells, sounds, or tastes like... I will start to get more detailed. If players start to ask, where exactly is the exit and where are all the guards situated, I will draw a map. For me the key is not to do more than is necessary since the players may not care. <br/><br/>The other key is that I accept that different players are imagining different things. Very few things I say or draw will be more vivid than their imagination. So I try to limit what I detail so we are at least on the bare minimum same page while still allowing different people to imagine different things. <br/><br/>I do find though that if I write something down, even if the players didn't ask for it, it helps ensure the players will give it extra care. Of course if I write down too much, it has the opposite effect! Jotting down a brief list of clues or a list of environmental features or a list of major NPC usually means at minimum players will reincorporate many of those elements.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350512">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350512/#Comment_350512" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-05T06:24:42+00:00" title="December  5, 2011  6:24AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the case of miniatures games - a beautifully laid out terrain field is very good.

I'm thinking, for example, of a game of Werewolf where I drew a rough map of a small town with few details, and then the players went around adding places and color to the map before character creation (and then again afterwards). It made the whole concept of "territory" and "this place is alive" really sing, and that is still one of the best campaigns I have ever played in or run. And the map, which was constantly updated and altered as we played, and which always sat dead-center in the table, had a huge part in the awesomeness of that game and in evoking the themes and tone of our game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350590">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Storn" title="Storn"><img alt="Storn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Storn">Storn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350590/#Comment_350590" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-05T13:57:19+00:00" title="December  5, 2011  1:57PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Despite being a very visual person, I often run games without "situational" maps.  But then again, I often run games with "situational maps".  It really depends on the, heh, the situation.  I have noticed that for some gamers, having a visual (where the airlock is compared to where the assault droid is lurking for example) helps tremendously.  They feel more free to make actions and moves with that quickly digested knowledge under their belt.  I'm quite capable of doing beautiful, elaborate, evocative maps that are publication worthy.  I don't do that all that often, I have a very large swipe file of good maps to use in a pinch.   I'm also very good at sketching a 20 sec doodle on a piece of paper to get the gist of what is happening.  <br/><br/>But a knife fight in an alley way using Burning wheel between just 2 duelists.  probably doesn't need one.  The system helps enforce the "space" where the fight is happening.<br/><br/>I sometimes combine a picture or photo with a map.  Especially with something that has vertical elements.  Scaffolding around the huge statue, for example.  One trick I used was using google earth and maps together and taking some screen shots for a spy/espionage shoot-out once.  That was very evocative as forests and the hill and the farmhouse in eastern europe became the scene of a fractious firefight and eventual last ditch hostage rescue.  Having a "real world" space, feeling like we were looking at Satellite surveillance, while the players planned their approach, that was cool and fun.  <br/><br/>In my online games, I run 90% of the combats with a map, even ones I've quickly sketched out.  Because we are not face to face, I find having a visual in our shared Maptool space really, really helps.  And it happens that a couple of the players in that are real minis lovers.  Which is totally cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350597/#Comment_350597" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-05T15:26:43+00:00" title="December  5, 2011  3:26PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 5, 2011 3:40PM by johnzo.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good maps provoke response from the table.

Maybe I'll try yoinking the basic concept there for use somewhere else, I might be able to get some mileage out of it.<br/><br/><br/>For just regular old maps, I'll stick to my original answer:  I personally don't like them or appreciate them, so I'll resist using them unless it's called for by someone else in my group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_350648">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350648/#Comment_350648" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-06T00:18:21+00:00" title="December  6, 2011 12:18AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 6, 2011 12:25AM by TomasHVM.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Stephen P</cite>I'm thinking, for example, of a game of Werewolf where I drew a rough map of a small town with few details, and then the players went around adding places and color to the map before character creation (and then again afterwards).

I enjoy wargame-y combat in a number of tabletop RPGs including Champions/HERO System and Savage Worlds.  (I've tried D&amp;D4, which I didn't particularly like, but didn't utterly hate.)  I've also frequently used quickly sketched maps for other games, like Call of Cthulhu, Dresden Files, etc.  <br/><br/>On the other hand, I also enjoy plenty of games where I don't use a map.  For example, I've never used a map in 1001 Nights or Polaris while enjoying them immensely.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>1) Assumption clash about what is going on.

They were assuming I was close by, while I was assuming I was at a distance.

Mostly that is <i>prior</i> to any combat, not during it. Such sketches supports their dialogue in a planning scene, by giving them an overall view of the terrain, and some details to refer to. As a support for such dialogue, the sketch is a good tool. I advice you to remove it once the combat is on.<br/><br/>Other than that; I'm typically using a city-map and a world- or kingdom-map, plus a plan of a traditional house, to give players a sense of their home/city/land and to inform their dialogue. All these have important written info on them, and together they "paint a picture" of the physical world we play in. On the same page is my use of a double-sided ressource-sheet, with info on popular songs and dances, traditional feasts, coins in use, inns and their menus, goods to be bought, and beasts of the wild. This info-sheet is actually the "GM-screen" of old, put on the table for all to use.<br/><br/>These maps/plans/sheets are put on the table, easy to reach and read for all. They are there to support the dialogue, by giving players on-hand setting-info. It helps players to use setting-relevant elements when talking in-character. It results in the player having a better feeling for the setting, and a far better feeling of the position of his character, both geographically and socially. <br/><br/>I find that in general this system of map/info-tools is very beneficent to the interaction in a classical role-playing game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE

class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like those kinds of uses for maps Tomas, and have done similar things. It can work a treat, and I also have used them more for informing play than for tactical fiddliness.<br/><br/>___________________________________<br/><br/>I like games played, not just with maps, but also with evocative minis and sometimes with whole table layouts.<br/><br/>I know that's not everyone's cuppa tea, but bear with me a moment. I have actually learned a few things over the years about how to use that stuff in a positive way, a fun way, and a way more in line with rpg style play than with it's cousin wargaming play.<br/><br/>First off, inspiration.<br/><br/>I know I come off as a bit of a horrible elitist when I get in convos about minis use and table set ups/maps because i'm actually one of those people who doesn't think that using whatever small coin or marker or randomly available mini is the best way to go about things, nor do i think that the randomly drawn map on the erasable grid mat or hex map is the way to go.<br/><br/>That stuff works decently if what you really care about is some kind of tactical fiddly position mongering.<br/><br/>I don't see it s terribly inspirational though, and I find it a bit backwards or out of proper order in approach.<br/><br/>A  bit like brushing your teeth with a lovely minty toothpaste, then having a big glass of orange juice. Wrong order if you want to have a pleasant experience. If you always do it, it may well lead you to the conclusion that orange juice is a terrible drink.<br/><br/>If I hear you've been doing that, suggest a different order, and you continue to do it in the wrong order, I'm going to conclude that Dain Bramage has occured, especially if you complain about how unpleasant the experience is and continue to do it anyway.<br/><br/>Start with the maps, minis, an open mind, and draw inspiration from them<b> first</b>.<br/>Second, keep the freeflowing nature of rpgs as a core method, even when you're playing with the toys.<br/><br/>Th first part means...choose your minis before you make the game. <br/><br/>For a player, choose a mini first, then make your character. For a GM it means pick out the baddies minis and the map(s) or table set up elements, then use them to inspire the adventures (or at least them beginnings of them).<br/><br/>Already by using that order of things, we begin to remove one barrier people find between imagination and the physical stuff.<br/><br/>The second part, use the freeflowing methods one associates with RPG fun during the game means just that. Fiddly exact range measuring and movement and even order of declaring actions can mostly go and get stuffed.<br/><br/>In some kinds of games, those methods are terribly important. Wargames for example. But most of what the fun is that you're having in wargames is of secondary or tertiary importance ( or even lower priority ranked than that).<br/><br/>Approximations of range, of time, of distance are all perfectly fine for most RPG play.<br/><br/>It's why quick sketches often have a higher value for RPG fun than something like D&amp;D 4e's much more involved grid'n'minis system.<br/><br/>You want high levels of player input, of inspration, coming from the stuff you're using. It shouldn't act as a block to those things, but a jumping off point for them.<br/><br/>It's perfectly fine to use approximations, eye-balling, whatever. It's okay to mess with scales of time and distance. Just keep things moving along. <br/><br/>That's the trick.<br/><br/>And it's an easy trick. You managed all that stuff as a kid when ya played with toys and dollies and action-figures and Breyer horses, long before you played an RPG with some sort of tactical rules. You manage it all the time in RPGs/SGs without those kinds of constraints/rules mechanics.<br/><br/>You just have to remember how to put those things back together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350704">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350704/#Comment_350704" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-06T13:31:59+00:00" title="December  6, 2011  1:31PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 6, 2011 1:53PM by johnzo.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>Okay, it's official:  maps don't really click with me.  I mean, those are okay, but not at all inspiring for me.  They're just...maps.  There's nothing there for me to give a fuck about.</blockquote>\nI'm looking at those maps as an ideavore DM who is always on the hunt for stuff to steal and I dig how the one-page dungeon format can push the mappers to confront the fruitful void.  <br/><br/>The maps that are just a compact gridded floorplan with a table of monsters and loot, I'm not so much into those.  But the sketchier ones like the Chinatown one or the Hallways of Thyme, those get me fired up.  <br/><br/>It's good lonely fun to figure out how I can make a player give a fuck about that map, and it's good table fun to explore them together and see what emerges.  Like Robert said: \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>Having constant, full access to that map meant everyone had a sort of idea-board handy that tied to the setting.

It becomes more like "making things up" than "trying to take advantage of an existing situation". If I can twist the reality of the fictional world to my advantage in this way, play could become more like a contest biased towards the person who speaks up first or speaks up most convincingly.<br/><br/>What are good ways of managing that issue?

Usually, they work a whole lot like what Tomas is describing as his methods.<br/><br/>However, I do like running games with that stuff as well, and in practical terms, starting from them as a basis is a whole, whole lot simpler than going in the opposite direction.<br/><br/>It's a whole lot easier on the budget as well. A game like D&amp;D with a vast universe of critters potentially popping up, and in weird combinations and in weird numbers, often to never be seen again after a given encounter or adventure, would basically break the treasury of a small nation if you were to attempt to collect all of the different stuff you'd need to play through two or three prepublished adventures.<br/><br/>I have to run off to work right now, but I'll try to start another thread on this and related topics when I come home for lunch today. I'd warn you to keep in mind that I'm still muddling through a lot of this concept myself though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350775">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350775/#Comment_350775" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-07T09:56:47+00:00" title="December  7, 2011  9:56AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: stefoid</cite>Ok, if this is a big issue, I want the gem thief to come up with a plausible plan as to how this sneaking/drifting away is going to occur - paint it for us, make us believe.</blockquote>\nWhy should they, if the other player can just block them instantly by saying "nope, I was watching you"? Either have them roll or not, or use a map so people don't get into these issues.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>It' seriously un-cool to grab the word as fast as possible, and make up<i>magic solutions</i>every time.<i>Magic solutions</i>(something coming out of the blue, saving the characters) makes the game loose its magic.<br/><br/>But I rarely see players do that. It's not really an issue.<br/></blockquote>\nThis assumes you have players with similar spatial senses. Completely untrue in my case. My wife can't find her way out of a mall.  A verbal description to her is worse than nothing.  If I don't use a map with her, I might as well send her out of the room during an action scene. She can't visualize where she is or what her options are, and, if she is forced, miserably, to guess at an option, she will unerringly choose something that completely invalidates everything everyone else was imagining, 100 percent of the time.<br/><br/>So let's talk about why maps are good. It's not just for tactics.  It's for any game where action is important.  In an action film, the protagonist tries to accomplish something physical.  The tension of the scene comes from whether they accomplish it or not.  So it's important for the filmmaker to establish a visual layout of the scene.<br/><br/>Let's watch such a scene now, from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXIcaOzFVeQ" rel="nofollow">Die Hard 2</a>, not the greatest action movie of all time, but a pretty solid, middle of the road action scene.  Especially note that we can see the location of the second bad guy at :08 (even though this obscures the impact of one of the characters).  A reverse shot at :18 shows us another view of this relationship (along with the reason the bad guy doesn't fire).  At :20 we see a vertical composition of the space - the characters are above a jet engine and the second bad guy is somewhat elevated from them.  And so on.  Throughout this scene, the filmmakers use visual cues in order to create the space for the characters to act.  John MacClain's character is not the greatest fighter, but he has tenacity and improvisation.  Note that both characters he fights get the better of him and put him in situations where he has to use those character traits in order to achieve the goal.  In fact, the interior of the plane, where the ultimate badguy is, is in sight literally from the first second of the fight, even though MacClain never enters it.<br/><br/>To look at a failure to establish the physical space of the action, look at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l4qdf_1nGM" rel="nofollow">Mission Impossible 3's bridge scene.</a>  I love this example because it's clear that the set designers and art people knew that you had to establish physical markers to help the audience orient themselves in the scene - see if you can spot them as we have yet another tight close-up on Tom Cruise running or bad guys looking through a sight.  In this scene it is absolutely impossible to see what each participant (and how many are there?) is trying to accomplish physically, or to place that physical action in a larger context, or feel any tension that they may or may not accomplish it.  <br/><br/>Turning to RPGs, action RPGs again have a similar setup for tension - we have a physical goal and we may or may not accomplish it.  This is the setup for D&amp;D, Spycraft and many many other games and subgames.  In order to create that tension for how a <i>physical action</i> may or may not take place, the players must have some sense of the physicality of the location, the reality of the location.  Maps, broadly or specifically drawn, help with that.<br/><br/>Now, if your game isn't an action game - if what you're trying to show is the chaos and horror of war  (for example), then the physicality of the space isn't  really an issue, what you're trying to accomplish has less to do with a physical action and more to do with chance and fate.  And that is why Saving Private Ryan's famed <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZgKo46X8CI" rel="nofollow">Omaha Beach landing</a> scene only shows us the full physical space of the scene over the jittery-shot, out-of-focus shoulder of a German gunner who takes up half the screen, and only rarely.  We never see a character we recognize in anything further away than a medium shot.  In these sorts of games, Tomas' technique is very effective.  When everything's awhirl with chaos, a good sense of physical space may actually hinder the tension and release of the scene.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350777">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch" title="Will_Hindmarch"><img alt="Will_Hindmarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.wordstudio.net/coffee_ring-32px.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch">Will_Hindmarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350777/#Comment_350777" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-07T10:22:49+00:00" title="December  7, 2011 10:22AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like maps.<br/><br/>[This is me not getting into an argument about fight geography, player/character awareness, and hyperbole in a conversation about the role of maps.]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_350779">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350779/#Comment_350779" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-07T10:32:49+00:00" title="December  7, 2011 10:32AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm sure your wife would love to play our way, Jason, in spite of her lack of "spatial senses". We're ditching the whole spatial thing, and go for emotional content and fun action. Most women I've done so with, have been enthused at the end of it.<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>So it's important for the filmmaker to establish a visual layout of the scene.<br/><br/>Let's watch such a scene now, ...</blockquote>Very thorough and long example/explanation, and it fail to convince me that we need tactical sketches to make great action scenes in role-playing games. We may use them, yes, but the fact is that I've had the best action scenes without them.<br/><br/>I believe that is due to great action hinging on more than the physical surroundings. Amongst the most important is the <i>tempo</i>; we need things to happen fast for it to "overwhelm" our senses, and be perceived as threathening/thrilling/flabbergasting. We've seen very few action movies actually slowing down when "the shit hits the fan". But we've seen loads of role-playing games do it; slow down to an oozing crawl of aaa-aaa-aaa-aaa-ction. And that is mainly due to our use of these sketches, or battle maps, and the minis that has to be moved and fiddled with, and all the methodical consequences that follows in the wake of this practice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350786">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350786/#Comment_350786" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-07T11:44:28+00:00" title="December  7, 2011 11:44AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 7, 2011 11:44AM by JDCorley.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>I'm sure your wife would love to play our way, Jason, in spite of her lack of "spatial senses".

It touches on some questions I replied to JhKim with.  And thats the relationships between characters during action.  So we agree, this is where action is at - tension due to the relationships between characters - <i>this one is doing X, that one is doing Y, and this one wants to stop X and help Y but cant do both at once so must prioritize</i>, yada yada...<br/><br/>So  is the concrete spatial part of the relationship between characters the most important part of that relationship? - because when you break out the map, thats what you tend to focus on, to the detriment of the imgained space, IMO.

Words or maps or pictures or whatever. The point of the movie comparison is that both in the movie and in the RPG, we must understand what the physical layout is if the question of the scene is about a physical goal and physical actions taken to achieve it.<br/><br/>If I say "the monster is looming over Deirdre as she screams, you're a few yards away in the door, Nick is tied up to the left and Bill is being dragged under the bed by a formless shadow", that may be sufficient to create a feeling, and if we're all on the same page about where everyone and everything is because we have a clear mental picture established through earlier discussion and familiarity, those words may be sufficient to create tension about what you will do and whether you will succeed, but it's also possible that you may think Nick is near the bed, or on the opposite side of the room from the bed, or that Nick is to your left and safe, or to the monster's left and in danger, and so on.  Whereas a map, whether sketched or precise, sets out the question of that action scene in firm detail, which the system and players then answer.<br/><br/>Words CAN work, sure, but maps can be very effective as well.<br/><br/>What about all those visual thinkers out there?  How can they make a decision about action when they don't know what the fuck is going on from my brilliant description?

Your description is fine, and Im imaginging some cool stuff.  If I was looking at some stick figures and rectangles, it wouldnt really help at all, except to pull me out of my head space.  <br/><br/> Nick is either in danger from the monster, or he isnt.  thats the improtant thing about the relationship between Nick and the monster.  Nicks proximity is not important - the monster might have its back to him (oh, let me draw the orientation of the monster on the map for you), it may have a long reach or be incredibally quick, or it may not care about Nick at the moment at all ,  which is what you are implying because it is menacing another character entirely.<br/><br/>It may be that deemphasizing the spatial and focussing on objectives actually helps people with poor spatial imagination like your wife.  I mean, given that your description of that scene contains little concrete spatial info, would your wife have a problem with it?  <br/><br/>I think if in general, the game/GM doesnt emphasise spatial relationships, then players can relax about that issue and not fuss about getting everyone nailed down before proceeding with the actual conflict.  so if your wife says some intention for her character, and the GM nitpicks - "oh, in my imagined spatial picture of the scene I dont see that as possible because of the prximity of yada yada", then of course your wife is going to freak because now she is required to know where everything is.

If I'm not using a map, I might devote less words to spatial relations - but I will likely focus in on other concrete physical stuff like how they are standing, what they are wearing, how they smell, what the sword looks like as it swings, and other details.  If I am using a map, I will use it as well as putting in more verbal description of space and the surroundings.  For example, I might point to spots on the map and say "These are looming dark stone columns." - which I might have not mentioned if I were not using a map.  <br/><br/>It's possible that this focus is to the detriment of the interplay of objectives.  For me its a stylistic preference - one that I care about more than how much the objectives and/or imagined space are emphasized.  <br/><br/>On reflection, some of the recent story games that I like more are ones that don't make you state objectives.  For example, in Polaris you only state outcomes - as opposed to games like Dogs in the Vineyard or Burning Wheel where you have to explicitly state an objective for each conflict.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: stefoid</cite>The comparison with a movie, while it illustrates a point about relationships and gives insight to movies, isnt really fair with an RPG - a movie<i>must</i>establish the relationships between characters visually - its a movie!

Being the reason this kind of "action", with minis and sketches, have been increasingly frowned upon. Being the reason players have begun dropping off the D&amp;D carousel, due to that game doing this "better" than ever ...<br/>Your "empirical proof" is a bit dubious, Jason.<br/><br/>But of course; maps ARE a great help, and maps ARE positive and good. I'm in total agreement on that! I love maps! It's just a tool you have to know when to use, and not. In the games I play, my maps (however wonderful and dearly loved by me) have no worth in themselves; the use of maps is subject to the larger needs of the game and its players. The map is good if it is of use; if it supports good interaction, without bogging it down. In a role-playing game the battle map is seldom of worth, as it very seldom is the answer to any true need of the players, or any need of the game. <br/><br/>Building a game around the battle map is possible, of course, and may give us some fun. But to me it is like building the game on a premise that is truly an anachronism. We have better ways of dealing with these challenges now; solutions that brings us further and higher, and helps us have much more fun.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>I asked my wife about your question, stefoid, and here is her answer:<br/><br/>"If you de-emphasize spatial stuff like that, now I'm even more disconnected from my character than I normally am.

You argumentation tells me that your wife is probably in games where any player would develop a stronger "need" to have this kind of stuff emphasized. It comes with the territory; you play that way, and she must react that way, being who she is.<br/><br/>In spite of the title, to me this is not a debate about removing the map; it is actually a debate on what you do when there is no map, and how you work to open up the creative void, having great interaction, and scenes that comes alive like never before. Try coming at this from the positive side; how can I find other solutions, not to the problems inherent in the use of maps, but to the basic challenge; <i>How do we make our scenes work?</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350874">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350874/#Comment_350874" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-08T00:57:42+00:00" title="December  8, 2011 12:57AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I added this thought to my relationship-map post, but I thought Id seperate it out in light of Tomas's last post:<br/><br/>"EDIT: so in this situation, the question of whether characters are physically located such that they <i>can</i> attempt their objectives is subsumed by the test to see whether they <i>do</i> achieve their objectives. Failure could be narrated as "didnt get there in time" or "opponent was quicker" etc... I think in general, the assumption should be that the characters are in a physical position to attempt their objectives unless it has been previously estbalished that they defiantely arent."<br/><br/>And Ill add to that - if you want to concentrate on positioning as a significant point in the fiction, you can do that fictionally without nailing it in two dimensions.  An Ingenero player might try to gain an advantage over an opponent, for instance, by making a play to <i>take the high ground</i> or <i>retreat out of bow range</i>, or <i>take cover</i>, or in JHKims example, <i>lurk out of sight</i>.  Once established, by conflict resolution if necessary, these positional relationships are concrete.  I think that works just great for action games.

If they say they don't like it, it seems quite a reasonable conclusion that - in fact - they don't like it.  <br/><br/>However, other players say that they enjoy D&amp;D4 - and further there are players who say they enjoy Pathfinder, Champions, GURPS, Savage Worlds, and many other games that use miniatures and sketches.  The key point here is that some people can [i]like[/i] D&amp;D4, while others can [i]dislike[/i] it, without anyone being wrong.  Moreover, shifts in the market are irrelevant to the question of whether something is fun, since individuals can have genuine fun with something that is steadily unpopular, steadily popular, rising in popularity, or falling in popularity.  <br/><br/>Personally, I enjoy Champions and Savage Worlds in particular using miniatures and sketches.  I find it easily conceivable that you, Tomas, would not enjoy the same games that I derive enjoyment from.  You're not wrong in your tastes.  You are wrong, however, to imagine that your tastes represent an objective reality where I am objectively wrong for enjoying a long tactical Champions fight - and really I should be enjoying a series of quick, verbal-only fights more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_350975">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350975/#Comment_350975" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-08T23:32:26+00:00" title="December  8, 2011 11:32PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 8, 2011 11:47PM by TomasHVM.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dear John! Of course people are not wrong to dislike D&amp;D, or to like it. I'm only answering in kind to the preposterous "proof" by jason:<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Maps can help a lot and be very positive and good.  Empirical proof: the whole fucking hobby forever.</blockquote>His "empirical proof" is a bit dubious when you know that a whole lot of that "whole fucking hobby" has grown increasingly bored by this way of doing it. It's another nail in the empirical coffin that a large portion of D&amp;D players fled the game, or fled back to earlier versions of the game, when 4E came out, due to that edition of it doing this map &amp; minis thing better than ever. When role-players, which are a exceedingly loyal bunch, do this, it is a strong signal of something ...<br/><br/>So I'm saying that Jason serve us with very dubious "empirical proof".<br/><br/>But, to take the debate one step away from such silly claims ...<br/><br/>- debating the likes and dislikes of people as if they are arguments in each others disfavor, is null and void. It's a matter of taste. <br/>- but debating how games work for people, and don't work, due to inherent strengths and/or weaknesses, is very useful. We need to deepen our insights in role-playing games, their methods, and how they work on human beings. It's a matter of knowledge.<br/><br/>It is necessary for us to make a distinction between <i>good</i> games and <i>bad</i> ones, and to do that we need to analyze what people do when playing them, what kind of experience they have, and what the basis for that experience is. One part of that is to analyze our likes and dislikes.<br/>- Why do so many people find map &amp; minis style of play so boring?<br/>- Why do so many find it frustrating to have the battle-map removed?<br/>- Why do som many find it liberating to play high tempo and simply resolved action scenes?<br/>- Why do so many love the rolling of dice, and the release of pent up tension that a successful roll gives?<br/>- What are the weaknesses in the different styles?<br/>- How can we design to counter these weaknesses? And to strengthen game-play within a style of play?<br/><br/>To me it is quite clear that D&amp;D have tried to solve the problems of map &amp; mini style role-play, by taking on the problems head on with their 4th edition ... and their success in doing so is highly debatable. Players still have fun using the game, but the objective problems of the play style are still there. As a professional game-designer I seriously doubt if it's possible to succeed in solving the problems inherent in that style of play, at least in the way D&amp;D goes about it. <br/><br/>So I'm proposing to design for a better solution in how we are doing rpg action scenes (and other tactical scenes) without the battle map. I'm preferring to seek out solutions in other kinds of methodical tools. I've debated this since the late eighties, and worked on it continually in my design of <i>Fabula</i> since the mid nineties. I've had some abysmal failures, and some very bright successes. I try to learn from my successes, and they spell out that tactical scenes may be done fairly easily, and with a very high degree of success, by using higher tempo, and a system of other simple narrative and mechanical tools.<br/><br/>My experience says that the way forward, towards more entertaining action, is to consider the battle-map a redundant feature.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350976">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350976/#Comment_350976" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-08T23:44:48+00:00" title="December  8, 2011 11:44PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tomas,<br/><br/>I've read with great interest some examples you've posted of the "frantic battle scene" at high tempo in other threads. I find the technique really interesting, for all the reasons you yourself mention.<br/><br/>However, whenever I imagine myself running a game this way, it seems like that GM is the one making all the decisions. The players are presented with indefinite choices (because they have limited information - e.g. "Someone crashes into you from behind! You can't see who it is, but you think they have a knife! Do you stab them now?"), and so the GM is the one who is essentially painting the entire scene.<br/><br/>In my imagination, it seems completely the opposite of the "combat on a map", which has among its strengths the feature that the GM can lay out the map and its tactical features, and then what happens next is entirely up to the players and dice.<br/><br/>Is the heavy role of the GM in determining how such a frantic fight scene actually turns out (was that person you just stabbed an important enemy, or an innocent friend you stabbed accidentally?) something you can get around? If so, how? Or is it actually a feature of this style of play, and one you aim for?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350977">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350977/#Comment_350977" name="Item_97" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-08T23:44:51+00:00" title="December  8, 2011 11:44PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 8, 2011 11:47PM by komradebob.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a bit of an old concept at this point as well Tomas.<br/><br/>I mean, that approach was novel in 1980 and 1990...<br/><br/>The thing about the D&amp;D 4e approach is that it's like a 1978 minis skirmish game design on steroids.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_350979">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350979/#Comment_350979" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-09T00:29:06+00:00" title="December  9, 2011 12:29AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 9, 2011 6:05AM by TomasHVM.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Robert; I know! But still it is a concept that is new to a lot of role-players (change is slow), and a concept that is far from explored to it's potential depths. So we need to continue our search for knowledge!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>However, whenever I imagine myself running a game this way, it seems like that GM is the one making all the decisions. The players are presented with indefinite choices (because they have limited information - e.g. "Someone crashes into you from behind! You can't see who it is, but you think they have a knife! Do you stab them now?"), and so the GM is the one who is essentially painting the entire scene.</blockquote>You are right.<br/><br/>How are you right?<br/>- Well ... the GM plays a very strong hand when doing this, as a hand of fate, doing his best to spin events out of control. Characters/players need to experience lack of control, to open up the emotional content of conflicts, and preparing them for the all important aftermath. <br/><br/>As a player you are pushed and dragged through conflicts, and stressed in your decicion-making. You still have some control over your character, and responsibility for its actions, and you do take part in the flurry of events that constitutes the interaction, but you are not in the drivers seat; it's as if the conflict itself takes over, and makes you a sailor in a storm; ride it out or go under! It is a highly exciting experience, and challenging on several levels.<br/><br/>And then; when the conflict is resolved, you are given ample time to take independent initiatives in the aftermath. Most conflicts are really felt after they're over, so I make a method where players are encouraged to explore that part of it very thoroughly. That is the gist of it; we make much more out of the aftermath, that being the time when conflicts really hit us, socially and emotionally. So we play how the characters deals with the content and outcome of the conflict.<br/><br/>And that's done with the player in the drivers seat, usually by letting him frame his own scenes.  By individual scene-framing and other means we facilitate that the player is telling himself what impact the conflict have had on his character. It is largely up to himself to narrate how his character deals with the fact that he stabbed a friend of his to death, in the heat of combat. There's all kinds of poignant and substantial choices to be had, and all the time in the world to ponder what to do about it ...<br/><br/>The player is supported in telling himself how the character deals with it, delving as deep as he wants into the subject. Will he tell the others? Will he keep it to himself? Will he rejoice in the victory, or mourn his comrade? Will he shake it off, or go into a dark mental hole? How will he deal with the heros welcome back home? When his father tells him he is proud of him, will he break down and confess then? And when his girlfriend giggles and cuddle him, will he feel too old and scarred for her, suddenly?<br/><br/>There is a lot of beautiful and exciting interaction to be had here, issues both emotional, social and moral, fueled by the conflict we have had.<br/><br/>And what happens to your character when the baron plans for another war-party, and wants YOU, the HERO, the VETERAN, the full blown WARRIOR, to lead the young and eager into hell?<br/><br/>- etc.<br/><br/>So; you are right, Paul; the GM plays a strong hand in the conflict, bombarding the field of interaction. But after the conflict the players rule the broken field. It's as much a shift in focus as a new way of doing conflicts, in my game. We make dirty conflicts fast and furious, and then we focus the main part of interaction on the dirty moral field created by the conflicts. <br/><br/>By some strange reason this kind of play is as fun as anything ...<br/><br/>I imagine that this way of doing it can be used for other purposes too, so please read this as my very special way of working this field at present, in this one game, nothing more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_351005">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351005/#Comment_351005" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-09T06:50:36+00:00" title="December  9, 2011  6:50AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 9, 2011 6:59AM by JDCorley.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>His "empirical proof" is a bit dubious when you know that a whole lot of that "whole fucking hobby" has grown increasingly bored by this way of doing it.</blockquote>\nYou can repeat it, but it doesn't make ya right.<br/><br/>Anyway, your questions are good.<br/><br/>I just want to quickly say when I was a callow youth, one thing I disliked about the map is that it didn't let me cheat grandly as much.  I knew the GMs in my group really loved my descriptions of bold action, and would let me do them even if my character's positioning was all wrong, so I was able to spotlight-steal and step on other players' attempts to be effective when we didn't draw a map and I could be suddenly near the magical dingus/villain/princess.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351019">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351019/#Comment_351019" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-09T08:47:30+00:00" title="December  9, 2011  8:47AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 9, 2011 8:54AM by komradebob.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>Robert; I know!

I'm old, and for most of the time I've been playing, people absolutely played without minis and with only the basics of maps, and those only very rarely used, and generally of the quickie sketch variety.<br/><br/>Just like you want to continue exploring stuff without maps and minis, my on interest is in using exactly those things, but with an updated look at how those things can be used in a positive way, to enhance enjoyment and spark imagination, rather than act as a barrier to it.<br/><br/>Honestly though, I've largely given up on trying to tease ideas for that sort of thing out of RPgers/SGers. These days, I'm more likely to try to approach minis gamers regarding ideas of how to get more RPing/StoryMaking out of minis games than the other way around.<br/><br/>The majority of RPers/SGers seem vastly more stuck in their concepts of what maps and mnis can be used for than their counterparts in the minis gaming community.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

Of course people are not wrong to dislike D&amp;D, or to like it. I'm only answering in kind to the preposterous "proof" by jason:<cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Maps can help a lot and be very positive and good.  Empirical proof: the whole fucking hobby forever.</blockquote>His "empirical proof" is a bit dubious when you know that a whole lot of that "whole fucking hobby" has grown increasingly bored by this way of doing it. It's another nail in the empirical coffin that a large portion of D&amp;D players fled the game, or fled back to earlier versions of the game, when 4E came out, due to that edition of it doing this map &amp; minis thing better than ever. When role-players, which are a exceedingly loyal bunch, do this, it is a strong signal of something ...<br/><br/>So I'm saying that Jason serve us with very dubious "empirical proof".<br/>Nonsense.  Jason is absolutely right.  Maps are not [i]necessary[/i] for a fun game, but as Jason said, they [i]can[/i] help a lot and be very positive and good.  <br/><br/>Even if gaming fashions were change so that map-based RPGs were no longer the most popular, that doesn't dispute the body of evidence that games that emphasize maps have been and are fun.  If something is [i]not currently popular[/i] - that doesn't mean it is [i]not fun[/i].  For example, collectible card games have dropped in popularity from the heyday of Magic: The Gathering and Pokemon.  That doesn't mean that CCG's are never fun and are always a bad design decision.  That's just changing fashions of gaming.  <br/><br/>And the fact is that RPG fashions have not changed against maps.  The dominant tabletop RPGs still emphasize maps, just as they always have.  Even if many players are leaving D&amp;D4 for Pathfinder and earlier editions, the games they are going to still make lots of use of maps.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>So I'm proposing to design for a better solution in how we are doing rpg action scenes (and other tactical scenes) without the battle map. I'm preferring to seek out solutions in other kinds of methodical tools. I've debated this since the late eighties, and worked on it continually in my design of<i>Fabula</i>since the mid nineties. I've had some abysmal failures, and some very bright successes. I try to learn from my successes, and they spell out that tactical scenes may be done fairly easily, and with a very high degree of success, by using higher tempo, and a system of other simple narrative and mechanical tools.<br/><br/>My experience says that the way forward, towards more entertaining action, is to consider the battle-map a redundant feature.</blockquote>\nMy advice is this:  you don't need to decide on or follow "the" way forward for the whole of the RPG hobby.  You can consider the battle-map a redundant feature and come up with a great game based on that, even if other RPGs that use a battle-map (like Pathfinder and Savage Worlds) remain popular.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_351031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351031/#Comment_351031" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-09T11:17:15+00:00" title="December  9, 2011 11:17AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>That may because those D&amp;Ders are using some fairly ancient approaches to tactical gaming.<br/><br/>Check out this review of a more modren take on that sort of thing, via the old west genre.<br/><br/>Yes, it is for a miniatures games.

We have a greater tool-bag at our disposal, and a whole arsenal of potential techniques to explore. So no wonder we focus much of our attention on other things than the use of miniatures.<br/><br/><br/><br/>I'm not shocked by those things. I'm appalled that when minis and maps are used, that players seem incapable of making the same sorts of methodical jumps with thm that they've made with other aspects of gaming. Instead they fall back on methods that are hopped up versions of something that largely went out of fashion 30 years ago, and look at it as the only valid approach.<br/><br/>It gets me even more when I listen to folks talking about that approach and just know that most of them as children, prior to ever encountering an RPG that taught them to be fiddly and not look at the inherent story insprations build into the toys, were perfectly capable of making the kinds of jumps of method in their play that they seem no longer capable of making.<br/><br/>I mean, some of this stuff is really basic. If I gave some one the constraint:<i> You're going to play Ben Kenobi. But instead of Alex Guinnes playing the part, Dennis Hopper is going to playing the role. Filter the concept and your portrayal through some popular movie role Dennis Hopper played that most folks at the table are gonna know</i>, somene would come up with something great, or at least pretty amusing.<br/><br/>If I give someone the constraint: <i>Go over to that shelf at the Game Shop, poke around and find a mini that you just think looks interesting. You're going to base your character of that miniature, so try to think of a few things that make inspire you about that mini or get your creative juices going. Don't start with a concept. just go look around and see what you see and grab one tht strikes you.</i>, I'm inevitably going to have somebody coming back and complaining that they couldn't find anything that fits what they were thinking of and t least one person coming back andunable to talk about any real inspiration that they get from the mini. <br/><br/><i>So, what's he like?</i><br/><i>Um, he's a dwarf?</i><br/><i>Well, let's see. he has a whole bunch of pretty intricate clothing on, and a big braided beard. his ax is pretty fancy too. So what's all that about?</i><br/><i>Um, I dunno,he's a dwarf, and er, he kills folks? Like Orcs maybe?</i><br/><i>Okay, but why this one and not one of the ten other dwarfs? Or an elf for that matter? And why the big, intricately carved ax?</i><br/>Blank Stare occurs here.<br/><br/>And then, we get to the methods being used.<br/>I mean, kee-riste! We regular scene frame aggressively, scene cut, play with scales of time and distance, add stuff in at the drop of a hat that just ought to be there without problems when we play strictly verbally. Bang bang bang goes the action, unless of course we decide to zoom in and go to slow-motion.<br/><br/>Yet, pull out the minis and folks are suddenly vastly concerned that 1" equals three meters and each person's turn is ten seconds of action and good lord, what is the effective range on a 1911 Colt automatic????<br/><br/>And folks complain that they aren't happy with that, and do it anyway. That's a method problem, not a problem with the map, or minis, or table layout.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_351036">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351036/#Comment_351036" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-09T11:42:59+00:00" title="December  9, 2011 11:42AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonzo:<br/><br/>Savage Worlds is kind of an interesting case among RPGs in that the designers very clearly do have an interest in minis use, but aren't particularly tied to any profit directly coming from that use of minis.<br/><br/>From what I can tell, folks regularly use SW without minis, although it's very friendly to their use if you dig minis.<br/><br/>With WotC D&amp;D, there's a whole passel of economics wrapped up in the use off minis and the design of the mechanics.<br/><br/>_____________________<br/><br/>On a side note, when I talk about taking a different approach to this stuff, with starting with the toys as inspiration and taking a more freeflowing approach to their use, I'm not talking entirely out of my ass.

For me, the best way to communicate a situation (to me, or from me to others) is to use a mixture of words and drawings.<br/><br/>Actual thing that has happened: we're playing Burning Wheel. I give what I think is a great description of the situation (a hostage thing, with the players nearby). The first thing my friend says is "So, wait, where is this all happening?" There were important details that my description didn't have but yet were completely clear in my head. I draw a map (a crude one, I can't draw to save my life) and everyone's now on the same page, we have an awesome, fast, fighty scene. We go back to the map occasionally to save words since "I'm moving around this way" and pointing is easier to say than "I move around the clearing towards the closest hut, staying behind the trees."<br/><br/>It seems to me we have actual, real life experiences from people who have had games enhanced by maps. There are games (Burning Empires for one) that make use of maps in fantastic ways that, again, people have derived enjoyment from. These same people have also had good games completely without maps, as they've said.<br/><br/>I don't really even understand what we're talking about anymore. There are good systems, gamers, and sessions that use maps, but not all of them. Therefore maps are not bad. They may not be good either. They're a tool in the gamer (and game designer) toolkit, like dice or escalation or leading questions or cards or ritual phrases. There are good and not-so-good uses of all of these things.<br/><br/>A pertinent related question might be: Are descriptions bad?<br/><br/>1) They force one person's view on everyone else, instead of creating something that each person can observe and draw conclusions on independently<br/>2) The players have to spend more time describing exactly what they're doing, pulling them out of their headspace                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_351041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351041/#Comment_351041" name="Item_107" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-09T12:19:32+00:00" title="December  9, 2011 12:19PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Two things:<br/><br/>1) One negative aspects of maps is that in real life we never see them. There are a lot of combat descriptions from fiction as well that pay no attention to physical positioning (two examples: Asha Greyjoy's battle outside of Moat Cailin in one of the later SoIaF books and the description of warfare in Le Mort). So maps, by there nature, do tend to take away from a sort of simulation-based approach to games that try to emulate these experiences.<br/><br/>2) Also, a lot of the positive aspects of maps become moot if the GM doesn't have ultimate authority. If the GM or whoever describes a room and you say your guy does something that fits with the stated description, there's no absolute reason that the GM needs to do correct you because the picture in his head doesn't jive with your statement, he could, instead, alter his picture to fit your description. That being said, in a traditional GM-knows-all situation, I think its very hard to communicate whats going on with out diagrams/images like maps.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351043/#Comment_351043" name="Item_108" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-09T12:30:41+00:00" title="December  9, 2011 12:30PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 9, 2011 12:32PM by Paul_T.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tomas,<br/><br/>That's a fantastic explanation, and really puts across the style of play you're describing. Thanks!<br/><br/>It also makes it pretty clear to me why you and others (e.g. Jason/JDCorley) are not connecting fully in this discussion.<br/><br/>This tool you're describing is a fantastic technique for creating a certain type of game: one where violence is something never entirely under your control, always dangerous, always uncertain, and the real question is about the consequences, the ramifications, and the way it changes the hearts and souls of the people involved.<br/><br/>However, I'm pretty that the other position in this thread is something along the lines of:<br/><br/>If what's at question in the game is "how does this fight/conflict/battle affect the characters?", then this technique is fantastic.<br/><br/>However, if what's at stake in your game or story is: "Can the heroes defeat the villains, despite their positional advantage/greater numbers?"<br/><br/>...then maybe this technique isn't really going to be terribly helpful.<br/><br/>I, for one, would not want to be GMing a game where the techniques employed allow me to decide directly the victory of one part or another, and the outcome is what's at stake. I would feel "burned out" pretty fast: at that point the game would become a heavy responsibility instead of a fun pastime.<br/><br/><br/>EDIT: Massively cross-posted!

I'm appalled that when minis and maps are used, that players seem incapable of making the same sorts of methodical jumps with thm that they've made with other aspects of gaming. Instead they fall back on methods that are hopped up versions of something that largely went out of fashion 30 years ago, and look at it as the only valid approach.<br/><br/>It gets me even more when I listen to folks talking about that approach and just know that most of them as children, prior to ever encountering an RPG that taught them to be fiddly and not look at the inherent story insprations build into the toys, were perfectly capable of making the kinds of jumps of method in their play that they seem no longer capable of making.<br/><br/>I mean, some of this stuff is really basic. If I gave some one the constraint:<i>You're going to play Ben Kenobi. But instead of Alex Guinnes playing the part, Dennis Hopper is going to playing the role. Filter the concept and your portrayal through some popular movie role Dennis Hopper played that most folks at the table are gonna know</i>, somene would come up with something great, or at least pretty amusing.<br/><br/>If I give someone the constraint:<i>Go over to that shelf at the Game Shop, poke around and find a mini that you just think looks interesting.

Don't start with a concept. just go look around and see what you see and grab one tht strikes you.</i>, I'm inevitably going to have somebody coming back and complaining that they couldn't find anything that fits what they were thinking of and t least one person coming back andunable to talk about any real inspiration that they get from the mini.<br/><br/><i>So, what's he like?</i><br/><i>Um, he's a dwarf?</i><br/><i>Well, let's see. he has a whole bunch of pretty intricate clothing on, and a big braided beard. his ax is pretty fancy too. So what's all that about?</i><br/><i>Um, I dunno,he's a dwarf, and er, he kills folks? Like Orcs maybe?</i><br/><i>Okay, but why this one and not one of the ten other dwarfs? Or an elf for that matter? And why the big, intricately carved ax?</i><br/>Blank Stare occurs here.</blockquote>\nI dunno. I have a bunch of evocative miniatures that I've created personalities and histories for, and "Dennis Hopper playing Ben Kenobi" gives me nothing to work with at all. Which one is Dennis Hopper again?<br/><br/>I think the problem isn't the techniques being used. It's that some people are into acting and some people are into miniatures.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_351049">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351049/#Comment_351049" name="Item_111" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-09T14:11:50+00:00" title="December  9, 2011  2:11PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 9, 2011 2:14PM by johnzo.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>players seem incapable...folks complain that they aren't happy with that...the majority of RPers/SGers seem vastly more stuck in their concepts..</blockquote>\nBob, I am only saying this because I like a lot of what you post.

What we are discussing here is not the popularity, but the inherent weaknesses and strengths of map-use. <br/><br/>I've argued that the use of maps are very good for role-playing, them being great sources of inspiration, and a good way to <i>frame the setting</i>. Maps turned to good use in role-playing games are feeding the interaction, and result in higher quality game-play. I'm a great proponent for the use of maps this way, and have used considerable energy to explore the possibilities in practice.<br/><br/>I've also argued that the use of maps in specific conflict-situations, as tactical terrain for miniatures or other counters, are problematic. So I advice against using maps that way. It tend to bog down the tempo, and steal focus from other elements which are as important to the situations at hand. I have experienced that the use of sketches to clarify terrain in a planning situation is very good, but transporting those sketches into the fray of battle is to invite a stiff and slow way of playing the conflicts, and that's not very "action", nor very close to the actual sense of a conflict. To use sketches to clarify positioning in the rare instances that there is a real need for it, is good, but put them away when it's done. You don't have to base the whole situation on the use of such sketches, or formal battle-mats. That's my point of view.<br/><br/>On the other side; designers exploring the possibilities for using battle-maps in better ways, is welcome to prove me wrong in my assumptions. D&amp;D4 has had a go at it, with a lot of resources, but failed to convince me that this is a wise direction of classical rpg-design. Still: I'm not against people trying to make this kind of games. Anyone may make games of any variant for all I care. I only advice against using your creative strengths on a direction of design that I see as ripe with old-school weaknesses. I fear it would be a waste of energy. But please do, if you want to.<br/><br/>And then some polemics:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>Nonsense.  Jason is absolutely right.  Maps are not [i]necessary[/i] for a fun game, but as Jason said, they [i]can[/i] help a lot and be very positive and good.</blockquote>Seems to me you don't read what I write. As said: maps are great for some things, not so great for others. Trying to bring some nuances into it would be good for discussion. Jason is talking about "empirical proof" for the one thing, and that makes it a bit silly.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>My advice is this:  you don't need to decide on or follow "the" way forward for the whole of the RPG hobby.</blockquote>Your advice is sound, however misplaced. Who in the world would think that one man could possibly "decide" the way forward for the whole hobby??? You must realize that arguments like these makes your punches hit empty air. <br/><br/>Please read what I (or others) am actually writing. Discussing the matter at hand, and the real meanings, is so much better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_351071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351071/#Comment_351071" name="Item_115" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-10T00:43:04+00:00" title="December 10, 2011 12:43AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, awright, that was ranty mcrantpants coming out, and I really should've thought further before I hit enter.<br/><br/>For me, this stuff is dead easy, and it's dead easy to show in person.

As for proving you wrong - I'd like to suggest a possible way I might do that.  <br/><br/>I could try out a particular technique of using a battle-map, and then take a particular group of players and try some combats using a battle-map with that technique and some combats without using a battle-map.  If the players enjoy the use of the battle-map with my technique, and find that - to them - the combats using the battle-map plus my technique are fun and a fun and worthwhile option - then that would be evidence against your assumption.  If I were to repeat this reliably with many groups of players, then the assumption would be proven wrong.

The second battle brought in the big guns, geeky Dip Ones who summoned the Great Old Ones: Isaac Azathoth (who pounded opponents and buried areas and people under mounds of prolific writing) and Harla Nyarlathison (a writing mass of grasping tentacles, a reference to his 2006 Hugo Awards behavior).  The map - especially the piles of books - and the paper minis were definitely a part of the fun and point of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour" title="FigureFour"><img alt="FigureFour" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour">FigureFour</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351371/#Comment_351371" name="Item_120" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-13T11:48:27+00:00" title="December 13, 2011 11:48AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite><br/>I've argued that the use of maps are very good for role-playing, them being great sources of inspiration, and a good way to<i>frame the setting</i>.

I have seen games without a focus on battlemaps and mini's style tactical play that still benefited from "tactical" maps in action scenes, by inspiring the players and feeding the interaction.<br/><br/>I think the value of maps in a game reflect more on what inspires the players than anything else. Obviously Thomas isn't inspired by some kinds of maps, but I don't see why that makes them "bad" in any way.

I go on for a while in analysis about the Conan game in particular, so I'll talk a little more about the MWWG game here.  It would help if there were particular questions, though.  <br/><br/>My Macho Women With Guns games were drawn directly from the game as over-the-top parodies of sexist culture.  I picked Isaac Azathoth from the book as one of the centerpiece villains, and statted up Harla Nyarlathison as an original villain to add in.  The game play was very much war-gamey in the sense of moving around the map and shooting things - but the part of the payoff from that was in the satisfaction of who they were gunning down.  I felt that the map added to the shared visualization, as well as contributing to character - in particular Isaac Azathoth who would pop around on the map, leaving behind giant piles of books and papers that can bury characters and block movement.  <br/><br/>I think that the sense of mastery of using the system is important to the experience.  There is a different feeling that comes from successfully using a detailed system to win, as opposed to just having the GM describe your success in as quick a manner as possible.  <br/><br/>Like I said, questions welcome...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_351395">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351395/#Comment_351395" name="Item_125" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-13T14:08:29+00:00" title="December 13, 2011  2:08PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Because of this I will buy an A1 size paper and make a game that is only a map.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351442/#Comment_351442" name="Item_126" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-14T07:29:16+00:00" title="December 14, 2011  7:29AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll offer a bit of a counterpoint example to John Kim's minis using games.<br/><br/>In one of the more successful experiments in minis use, I got together with a buddy (Ewilen) and had a stab at playing a game where minis and a minis terrain board were core to the experence.<br/><br/>The game setting was Space 1889, specifically an expedition to the primeval, dinosaur and lizardman tribe infested planet of Venus.<br/>The game physically took place at EndGame in Oakland, CA, which is a minis gaming heaven as well as being probably the most Indie storygame friendly game shop in the known universe. We used their terrain collection and gaming table, and my own miniatures collection.<br/><br/>For mechanics, we used the Mythic GM Emulator. Although both Elliot and I owned the full Mythic RPG rules, we opted after very quick experimentation to go pretty much exclusively with the shorter MGME part, which meant that we were going essentially stat-less. Right, no more info was written up about character abilities than you'd find in Fiasco.<br/><br/>Saame went for the other fiddly sorts of things you'd commonly associate with minis use.<br/><br/>I didn't show up completely without any sort of situation in mind. Here's the part I offered, in terms of starting set up. Everything is from the POV of an assumed upstanding Britisher being contacted by an agent of HRM's government.<br/><br/><i>Something is riling up the otherwise peaceful Lizard Man tribes in the disputed border area between the British and German Colonial possessions. Further, our normal contact with those tribes is a small group of missionaries, and they haven't made any sort of contact with us now for a week.<br/><br/>A recent fly over of the area by one of our patrols has also discovered what appears to be large, strange ruins poking out of the jungle. even ruined, these structures are large in size and not the sort of thing any modern day lizardman tribe would be capable of building. Nothing else of this nature has ever been found here on Venus. We want you to take a team out to investigate those ruins and also see if you can figure out what is going on with the Lizardmen. </i><br/><br/>Now this bit is a neat example of knowing what you have available to use and using it to inspire the adventure. I knew EndGame had some nifty terrain that fit nicely with all of that (jungle, swamp, river, ruins, a cool primitive village of huts and a pallisade wall), and I myself had appropriate dinos, victorian adventurers, and a load out of cheap prepainted D&amp;D lizardy types like troglodytes, lizard men, kobolds(for young braves) and whatnot.<br/><br/>That's all we started with.<br/><br/>On the afternoon I met with Elliot to play, we took some time after discussing mechanics and their use, to come up with characters for the expedition. I pretty much laid out the collection of minis I'd brought along. They'd form the core of characters and human/animal threats that would/could end up being used.<br/><br/>The expedition ended up consisting of a Veddy British, upcrust former major with appropriately hyphenated family name, a rough and tumble drunky Australian airship pilot, Teddy Roosevelt, and Teddy Roosevelt's lesser-know, obsessive butterfly collector brother, Maynard. Accompanying them were about a squad of unnnamed British Naval Brigade troops, that naturally we knew would all end up as Red Shirts. We also had a remaining assortment of stuff, minis wise laying round, for use if other hmans showed up as the game went on.<br/><br/>Those characters? <i>All built off what story we saw in the minis</i>.<br/><br/>Yes, obviously we had the fictional setting info. We aren't going to leave that behind just because we start using minis.<br/><br/>There was however, no character building pre-game to speak of beyound those  very primitive and braod descriptions. The Roosevelt brothers were interesting as they both came froma safari themed pulp minis set. I made the joke that the one looked like Teddy Roosevelt. Elliot declared it indeed to be the futire American president, and went on to decide the family connection with the other character mini. The butterfly obsession was directly from that miniature. it appears with thick glasses, another Rooseveltian mustache, a safari hat and with a colorful butterfly on it, and a butterfly net.<br/><br/>I have to run for now and get to work, but I'll get back to the play of the adventure later today or tonight, and talk about painless sue of minis even in tactical situations, and without the use of involved timescale, range, or movement rules, as well as how other minis, and what we saw in them, combined with mechanics and setting to produce an enjoyable time, and a game with a good number of scenes (including multiple combat/action scenes) that was still played out in under six hours total play time.<br/><br/>For those interested in where the minis for the Roosevelt Brothers for this game came from:<br/><a href="http://www.pulpfigures.com/catcode.php?range=Personalities&amp;code=PHP&amp;number=8&amp;custID=70180811301323876454" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.pulpfigures.com/catcode.php?range=Personalities&amp;code=PHP&amp;number=8&amp;custID=70180811301323876454</a><br/><br/>They're the two figures on the left side in the top row.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_351449">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour" title="FigureFour"><img alt="FigureFour" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour">FigureFour</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351449/#Comment_351449" name="Item_127" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-14T09:08:19+00:00" title="December 14, 2011  9:08AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>Dhylan: I'm talking about a problem felt by lots of players, trying to analyze what goes on when you use battle maps or sketches, and saying something about how to do without them, and what that gives you back.<br/><br/>Seems to me you are reducing it to a matter of taste, on an individual level.

Can I add a thing to your summary?<br/><br/>\u201cEqual narrative control, coupled with lack of a conflict mechanic, decrease the desirability of a map.\u201d<br/><br/>I recently became worried that in a GMless game, a map would reduce my narrative control, and I wonder if Tomas is talking about the same thing above. Now, I love maps. They are the best. I never met a map I didn\u2019t like\u2026<br/><br/>\u2026 until last week I was playing a new version of Silver &amp; White. There was a map of the photography teacher\u2019s house there. It broke my heart. <br/>In S &amp; W, there is no GM, and the players trade control of various pieces of narrative control depending on when the characters touch. It\u2019s extremely evocative and it has a big fat fruitful void.<br/><br/>I previously always wanted a map. In any game with a strong GM, I definitely want a detailed map, because information about the space around us is mostly flowing one way (GM to player). Also, any game where line of sight or range is important, a map is a must as previously stated. <br/><br/>But there isn\u2019t even conflict resolution in S &amp; W, much less a need for line of sight. Narration about the world that surrounds the players is everyone\u2019s responsibility and a map that shows a set layout limits our ability. What if we want an upstairs? Or a separate wine cellar? What if I want to demonstrate our photography teacher\u2019s weirdness by narrating two kitchens and no bathrooms? <br/><br/>So I am adjusting the space in my head concerning what maps are good for: Maps are good for quickly transmitting information in one direction. More directions of information will reduce the desire for a detailed map. <br/><br/>Thanks for posting this topic, Steve. It has helped me clear up some thoughts I had about maps.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_351538">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351538/#Comment_351538" name="Item_130" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-14T22:34:59+00:00" title="December 14, 2011 10:34PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: stefoid</cite>My summary:</blockquote>Good summary!

Before the game began I laid out some Dungeon Tiles to fill a card table with the map.<br/><br/>One PC can turn into a small bird.  This exhausts him so it is not helpful during combat.  But his aerial scouting a few hours prior served as an excuse for the players to be familiar with the map and the location of the bandit's tents, wagon, campfire, etc.  Of course, the PCs did not know where the actual bandits were at the moment the game began (a few hours later).<br/><br/>The players were able to plan an approach and attack that used the terrain and how it meshed with their PCs' abilities.  Much more time was spent (and fun had) planning than in the action combat.  The fight did happen on the map, but we play a diceless game so the action still moved quickly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_351591">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DavidVS" title="DavidVS"><img alt="DavidVS" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/nMT00GFQS5U2U.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DavidVS">DavidVS</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351591/#Comment_351591" name="Item_133" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-15T13:18:56+00:00" title="December 15, 2011  1:18PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>What is conflict, really?</blockquote>\nI blogged as best I could about that <a href="http://davidvs.blogspot.com/2009/09/keeping-action-going.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/><br/>To summarize, here are some types of conflict: opposition, building/nurturing, exploring, searching/researching, puzzles, warnings/funkiness.

Look, people differ.  Some people respond better to verbal cues, some better to visual cues.  This is not exactly news.  But your insistence on the superiority of your favored approach in thread is reached the silly point.  There are no facts to argue here, just preferences and experiences.  And more people seem to disagree with you than agree with you, frankly (and no, Tomas does not count extra even if he posts enough for five people!).  And yet you keep on arguing with other people's experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351628">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351628/#Comment_351628" name="Item_140" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-15T23:39:02+00:00" title="December 15, 2011 11:39PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: stefoid</cite>I wouldnt mind maps so much if they were just useless - they arent.

I suppose this may be semantics at a certain level.  Obviously there is a difference between appreciating a poem and appreciating dance or a painting - but I think of them both as being imaginative.  Seeing a picture or a map does not, to me, engages my imagination as I think about everything else that is there - taking the information I see and imagining further.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: stefoid</cite>On a related note, I thought of an analogy - you know the best part of horror movies is at the start before you see the monster, right? everything is implied but you have to supply the concrete details from your own imagination.

In any case, I find it odd to use movies as an example - because regardless of that specific adage, it most certainly is not true that the best parts of movies in general are where you don't see things and instead have to visualize just from words.  Movies are a visual medium, and work well based on using visuals to communicate.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: stefoid</cite>I reckon 'there' is only important as far as it affects the conflict-relationship between characters, and that its better to state that relationship explicitly, rather than implied by coordinates.  i.e.  Im going: "<i>where I can cover both exits</i>"  or  "<i>where I cant be seen from the ground level</i>"  is in some ways (the most important ways?)<i>more</i>explicit than pointing to a map.<br/><br/><b>Interesting idea - has anyone heard of a roleplaying a session where players have their eyes shut, or in the dark?

The only cases of role-playing without seeing I can think of are a few limited cases in larps.

If you don't play like me, you could play like me and then not need maps!" Then someone else says "But I like maps and have found them to be really useful." and receives the reply "Yes. Things would be better if you played like me."<br/><br/>Why would I stop playing the way I like and work to emulate how YOU play just so I can stop using the tools that work for me? Especially since I've never experienced the problems you have with the tools I use.<br/><br/>From over here, it always seems to be a matter of taste whether or not maps are beneficial to a game. You can analyze the use of maps and its effects on games all you like, but I don't see how we could ever even approach a conclusion that they are objectively "good" or "bad" for games in general.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351711/#Comment_351711" name="Item_144" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-16T14:36:32+00:00" title="December 16, 2011  2:36PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Weeks</cite><cite>Posted By: stefoid</cite>My opinion is that [maps move] people from a...1'st person' headspace to a 3rd person headspace.</blockquote>\nI'm not sure if this is true, but even if it is, when did this beceome a problem?<br/><br/>Yeah, I'm wondering about this too.

How would that affect play?"<br/><br/>I played a Call of Cthulhu game where the Keeper had a whole set-up with mood lighting and sound and all that. There was a bit in the game where our PCs were all captured and supposed to have been in solitary confinement in a dark cell for a long time, so he shut out the lights for a little while then brought them up one at a time on each PC as they were interrogated.<br/><br/>I didn't really enjoy that part of it. The game was good, and he was a good GM, but I did find that tactic to be more distracting and annoying than helpful for immersion (though I may have been alone in that). It was an odd situation; there was a lot of stuff in the press about just how badly sensory deprivation and solitary confinement could mess up even hardened criminals at that time because of Guantanamo, but no one else at the table seemed to think it ought to really affect their PCs at all and basically played as if they had been in the dark only as long as all of us had as players.<br/><br/>I think it's a gimmick that could work if you want the surprise of putting something cool out on the table (an unexpected mini or, sorry, map!), but any sort of prolonged darkness just leads to annoyance and discomfort, a lesson I learned during my theater education that's stuck with me since.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_351888">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351888/#Comment_351888" name="Item_150" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-19T01:31:41+00:00" title="December 19, 2011  1:31AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Such gimmicks are interesting; some times they helps AND distracts play at the same time.

The touching kind of queers that, but Im not focussed on the touching, just the darkness.<br/><br/>And if someone mentions magic missiles....                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_353185">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353185/#Comment_353185" name="Item_158" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-04T21:57:39+00:00" title="January  4, 2012  9:57PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of my favorite play styles prioritizes subjective experience, as well as tactical decisions as a subset of that.  In trying to support this is <i>Delve</i>, I've tried out maps.  They help immensely in clearly establishing who is what and where, but they pretty much ruin the subjective experience.  <br/><br/>My solution has been to ditch the maps because of their downsides for this play style, and to replace their virtues with a different system.  That system is verbal consensus.<br/><br/>Basically: <b>when a moment of decision arrives, clarify relevant factors first, <i>then</i> choose</b>.  It's a hard habit to teach, but an absurdly easy one to practice once learned.  I've found that it takes the place of a map quite perfectly for the purposes of deciding whether to grab the artifact and run for the exit based on the badguy's location.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_353188">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353188/#Comment_353188" name="Item_159" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-04T22:07:40+00:00" title="January  4, 2012 10:07PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 4, 2012 10:08PM by David_Berg.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>[Maps] pretty much ruin the subjective experience.</blockquote>I want to clarify here that I'm not talking about ruining engagement, investment, fun, or ability to envision the fiction.  How maps affect those concerns seems to vary greatly from person to person.  The "subjective experience" I'm talking about is very specific, and is only a concern when prioritized.  I've known a lot of players and groups who did in fact prioritize this, and I personally love it, so that's why I'm acting as if it's relevant.<br/><br/>So what do I mean here by "subjective experience"?  I mean a sense of transportation, so that the "me" that looks out at my environment and decides what to do is firmly located inside the game's fiction.  In <i>absolute</i> terms, this is impossible, but, y'know, the closer the better.  For this goal, physical props are pretty much definitionally a hindrance, and I've found maps to be among the most hindering of the bunch.  (Unless the characters have a map, in which case the map is awesome.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_353189">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353189/#Comment_353189" name="Item_160" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-04T22:12:31+00:00" title="January  4, 2012 10:12PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 5, 2012 2:42AM by David_Berg.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In one scene where the characters were in darkness, I also put the play space in complete darkness.
