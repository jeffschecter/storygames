The results were the same: my calculations "told" me that these were sound mechanics, but they weren't fun. These days, I tell people not to trust math. Math cannot make a bad mechanic good, but it can delude you into thinking one is. Today, my immediate response to making a new mechanic is to call up a friend for a quick test.<br/><br/>- Ryan                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_262557">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262557/#Comment_262557" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-17T13:33:33+00:00" title="March 17, 2010  1:33PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ron,<br/>\n  I have a process.<br/>\nFirst, I make a spreadsheet that has highest possible roll versus lowest possible roll<br/>\nThen I take the same one and do avg vs avg.<br/>\n<br/>\nI set it up so that there is a different row for each stat.

Sometimes you encode the rules, sometimes it is more abstract.<br/><br/>You build "strategies". This depends on the game, and is the art-rather-than-science part of the coding. But the idea is that the strategy guides how the character makes use of its characteristics in some way.<br/><br/>You make a whole bunch of random characters. You assign each one a strategy at random.<br/><br/>Then you have them "fight", usually in random pairs, using the game's conflict mechanics (assuming they exist). You somehow "score" the result (even more of an art-rather-than-science). You look at the scores for patterns. (Hint: an important metric to look at is how long fights take. You expect, for example, that "evenly matched" bouts should last longer and huge mismatches should end quickly. If they don't something is wrong.)<br/><br/>This type of thing is usually best at telling you when things fail. In an extreme case, for example, if one strategy is always winning no matter what the character is like, that is probably a broken mechanic.<br/><br/>Some tweaks include things like testing a handful of weak characters against one strong one and see what happens. That sort of think.<br/><br/>All of this sounds harder than it actually is. Even very rudimentary code can uncover problems quickly.<br/><br/>Another thing to do, especially if you have strange dice mechanics, is to run Monte Carlo simulations on them to guess the probabilities. Usually a million or so rolls will tell you what you need to know.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262592">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262592/#Comment_262592" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-17T15:52:30+00:00" title="March 17, 2010  3:52PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First cut: Prototype.

Run 100,000 iterations and you've got a very good idea of how the dice will fall. Look at the mean, the mode, the median, how often the extremes come up and so on, and check that they are all in accordance with what you wanted from the mechanic. Where two characters are in conflict, you can also look at the above when an 'average' character fights with a 'weak' character or a 'strong' one, and check that the step up a category is neither too large nor too small.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you can't do that way, in general, is test mechanics that involve decisions during the resolution. As Joshua rightly points out, decisions can often hinge on the context in a way that is not amenable to such simple simulation. Wordman's approach is one way of attempting it, but there's always the risk you'll miss one strategy a priori, or underestimate the influence that context will have. Where the choice comes before the roll, or after it, the statistics are often straight forward. Where decisions come during the roll, it's a lot trickier. That said, decisions during the course of rolling do not guarantee an interesting system.<br/>\n<br/>\nActually setting people loose on the mechanics is something I see as the final layer of polish, as you should have already knocked off the jagged corners by then. Otherwise, you're wasting some of your precious testing time on something you should have already dealt with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262689/#Comment_262689" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-18T08:22:01+00:00" title="March 18, 2010  8:22AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another approach is to take a hard look at your moderate complexity and find ways to make it not complex at all.
