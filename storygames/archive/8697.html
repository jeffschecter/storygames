So when you sit down to play, you have no idea who your guy will be, but after building relationships, you have to figure it out collaboratively.  This reminds me of that, a bit.  In my experience it's a great way to develop a cohesive feeling and a sense of shared characters and elements.  Anything that gives me some influence over your guy is going to push in this direction, I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_192701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192701/#Comment_192701" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-15T21:56:42+00:00" title="February 15, 2009  9:56PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's definitely an interesting start to what I think is the next big collaborative thing I'm going to try out with my group. After having family drama plots fall on their face for campaign after campaign, I did a game where everyone was invested in the same family drama from day one moment one and it has taken off like a fucking rocket. Sure, in action games everyone needs a niche that is theirs and theirs alone, but few in my group are engaged enough audience members to care about anything that doesn't have something at stake directly for them.<br/><br/>I think step 6 destroys all value of the skill list you have in the previous segments, though. I mean, there are advantages to skill lists. Why suddenly throw them away and have people faced with a wide open vista? At that point in character creation you should have a much narrower focus than you did at the start.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_192705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JCunkle" title="JCunkle"><img alt="JCunkle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JCunkle">JCunkle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192705/#Comment_192705" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-15T22:47:35+00:00" title="February 15, 2009 10:47PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>I think step 6 destroys all value of the skill list you have in the previous segments, though.

The generic skill names and less potent die type automatically makes them less engaging, which was mostly the point.  <br/><br/>I wanted characters made of traits, but having the traits be in the hands of other players.  Players with a good idea of the character you wanted to play, but not necessarily giving it to you precisely the way you want. The chargen is mostly trad, minus the traits part. The gameplay could even be mostly trad too, but the mechanical bonus of doing "the awesome" that your friends request might encourage that kind of play in a manner that suggesting it in the sidebars won't.  <br/><br/>Or at least that's the idea, ya know.  'cause it's completely untested, being a drunken idea I posted on teh intarweb.<br/><br/>I'm interested on why you thought weakening he skill was a bad idea.  Could you expand on that?<br/>Also, what would be the result, in play, of a narrower focus? or what would that look like during chargen?  I'm having a hard time visualizing that, due to the angle from which I was coming at it. <br/><br/>I hope you read this post as charitably as possible, I mean everything in the spirit of sharing and curiosity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_192781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192781/#Comment_192781" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-16T10:41:02+00:00" title="February 16, 2009 10:41AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The advantage of skill lists is that you get to work out what sorts of things the characters will be doing, sometimes prior to character creation even starting. If I tell you "this is a game about courtly samurai, the skill list is poetry, flower arranging, cutting people's heads off with swords, and translating barbaric languages", that gives everyone a very clear picture of what's going on in the game.<br/><br/>If you then say "oh and you can just add in whatever skills you want", then people go "wait wut is going on in this gaem".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
