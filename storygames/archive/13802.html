I mean, there are a few D&amp;D-inspired d20 systems out there that I don't hate terribly (such as Mutants &amp; Masterminds), but the d20 rules I enjoy tend to be not-actually-related to the d20 brand (such as Bizenghast or Donjon). But the d20 and it's close cousin, the d100, are at least some of the simpler mechanics for compex rules.<br/>And I am totally with you on the failing rolls thing. I tend to have terrible luck with d20s and d10 pools (such as the old WOD). It isn't fun having a character who is actually "good" at things, and always fail rolls involving what they're good at. Few things suck more in a game than to have the sniper always miss his shots.<br/><br/>And seriously, if they are going on about less-crunchy games not being "realistic" enough, they seriously need to take a few steps back and re-examine what they've been playing.<br/><br/>Seems like this whole "having fun with the people but not having fun with the game" feeling is the thing this month.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312467">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whduryea" title="whduryea"><img alt="whduryea" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v220/Nugan/noose755.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whduryea">whduryea</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312467/#Comment_312467" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-14T10:50:22+00:00" title="February 14, 2011 10:50AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 14, 2011 10:52AM by whduryea.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can empathize. I don't hate D20, but I do find it very limiting. For a long time our group was chained to D20 products, for much the same reason as yours: there were several players who imagined that RPGs and D20 rules were synonymous and convincing them to try other things--outside of an occasional flirtation with World of Darkness--was difficult. Like your group, other systems were criticized for a lack of realism, which, I think, really meant a lack of overwrought combat mechanics or an emphasis on extra-mechanical play.<br/>\n<br/>\nUltimately, I too stopped enjoying gaming with them. I was tired of tedious rolling and arguments over rule-book minutia and jockeying for statistical advantage. Everything that I enjoyed about RPGs when I started my first D&amp;D; campaign with a group full of fellow RPG newbies--the storytelling, the character development, in character tension and excitement--was gone.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not sure what solution I can offer to you. It happened that I moved away for a few months after this, and when I returned the group had largely disbanded. This was followed by a tense period where we tried to rebuild the group with an emphasis on playing indie and self-created RPGs. We had high player turnover and some fighting and other nastiness. Ultimately, we settled into a group of about three players (with an occasional fourth) that share similar goals and enjoy game design and indie games. This probably isn't an ideal outcome for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, if you live in a moderate to large urban area it may be much easier to find a new group or fresh players with a more adventurous outlook. (I live in a very sparsely populated rural area, so even finding D20 players can be a challenge.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312471">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312471/#Comment_312471" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-14T11:00:32+00:00" title="February 14, 2011 11:00AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Like Jamie said, find some hippie/indie gamers and get in in an occasional game.

Nothing is stopping you from proposing a game of <i>Fiasco</i> either to this group or to another.<br><br>One way you might be able to improve the odds of them taking you up on your offer is to do a very short game before or after your usual session. There are a bunch of really fun story games requiring an hour or less to play - off the top of my head, I can recommend "Puppetland", <i>Happy Birthday, Robot!</i>, or (for two players) Seth Ben-Ezra's <i>Showdown</i>, which Seth reports he's close to finishing.<br><br>Another thing you can try is proposing story-gaming up your current game, although your GM sounds like the type who might not be interested. There have been dozens of ways that whiff-factor has been addressed, and dozens of ways to elicit story input from non-GM players, that are d20-compatible... but they'll all require GM buy-in, in addition to buy-in from everyone else.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312474">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whduryea" title="whduryea"><img alt="whduryea" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v220/Nugan/noose755.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whduryea">whduryea</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312474/#Comment_312474" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-14T11:17:46+00:00" title="February 14, 2011 11:17AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 14, 2011 11:18AM by whduryea.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brian Minter</cite><br/>misery tourism</blockquote>\nTotal aside: I <i>love</i> this phrase.

It didn't get to be popular by accident, and the people who like it are not uneducated fools who don't know better.<br/><br/>(The people who try to use d20 for everything, or who think that it's a great system for games that it frankly is not a good fit for, <i>those</i> people are fools.  Horses for courses, as always.  No game is perfect for everything and everyone, and no game ever will be.)<br/><br/>Now, I don't really know anything about mjbauer's group beyond what he's said here, but one thing seems clear; the problem is not that they like d20 and want to keep playing games with it, the problem is that mjbauer doesn't like their d20 games and wants to play something else.  And there aren't too many ways to proceed from that point.<br/><br/>First and foremost, I think it'd be useful to know <i>why</i> the two diehards in the group really love d20.  What specifically do they like about it?  Is there something in particular about the experience that d20 provides that they enjoy, is it comfort/joy in mastering the system, is it the opportunity cost of learning a new (potentially unfun) system, is it something else?  Just go ahead and assume that their reasons are 100% correct, logical, and unassailable: they like what they like and that's the end of the discussion.  All you need to figure out is WHAT they like, without worrying about how to argue them out of liking it.<br/><br/>Once you know that, you can do a better job of picking and pitching games that might appeal to them, and get them to meet you halfway.  And if you can't find good compromise games, or you find that you don't enjoy the compromise games, either, then at least you know that you tried to make it work and can leave that group with a clear conscience and no hard feelings.  If everyone enjoyed exactly the same things, the world would be a boring place, right?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312495">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312495/#Comment_312495" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-14T12:38:37+00:00" title="February 14, 2011 12:38PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A few (totally unoriginal) suggestions that often get thrown about in such threads, which I find quite positive:<br/><br/>* Start up a new game on the side. Invite all the players from your existing group, but be totally upfront about it being a different kind of game. That way you may be able to figure out (or to allow the other players to figure out for themselves) what portion of the existing group is open to different styles of gaming.<br/><br/>* Have an honest talk with them about being unsatisfied with the current gaming. This is a great little blurb here; it speaks to me:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: whduryea</cite>Everything that I enjoyed about RPGs when I started my first D&amp;D campaign with a group full of fellow RPG newbies--the storytelling, the character development, in character tension and excitement--was gone.</blockquote>\nThe key to this approach is not to discuss system/rules. Clearly, your group has some kind of attachment/brand loyalty, so "talking down" d20 might only get them on the defensive. If you can get on the same page about the kind of game you're interested in (let'say you go "intense interpersonal drama", and two of the players are like "Yeah, awesome! As long as we get to play our D&amp;D campaign on alternating weeks"), and what you all want to get out of it, <i>then</i> it might be much easier to say, "Hey, here's a game that we would really help us do [this thing we just talked about and agreed on].                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312504">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312504/#Comment_312504" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-14T13:07:53+00:00" title="February 14, 2011  1:07PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: mjbauer</cite>I still like hanging out with them, I'm just not enjoying the "game" portion of the evening.</blockquote>\nDuring a typical one of your sessions, what percentage of the time is character interaction and what percentage is messing with the fiddly bits in combat? <br/><br/>Also, there are a couple of flavors of d20 die-hards.

When you say "<i>now that I know what is out there (and what is possible) our bi-weekly game-night is sounding less and less appealing to me</i>", it's sounding an awful lot to me like you are the one who went away to Paris for the summer, discovered Euro-Art-Hause cinema, and now want to share that (from your point of view) obviously superior film experience with your friends, who are still wanting to go out every second Tuesday and watch the latest H-Wood action flick with a tub of popcorn.<br/><br/>This doesn't make either one of you right or wrong.<br/><br/>But it could be a clear signal that your tastes and interests have diverged sufficiently from their tastes and interests that you might just be better off saying "You know, I like hanging with you guys, but I'm just not into the gaming any more, so I'll bow out of this bi-weekly thing for a while, and will take the initiative to set up movie-nights/pub-outings/boardgame-nights/pick-up-street-hockey-games/whatever out of band so we can still hang out", and then finding yourself another group of gamers to game with that are playing the kinds of games that you feel you'd like to try out.<br/><br/>And my guess is that you might find that these guys you think you like hanging out with, you really only like the warm memory of the old gamer time context socializing, and that in actual fact, you have moved on and you don't really have much in common with them any more. Or, you might find that your friendships with them improve and deepen once the rut of an essentially not-in-common-and-unfun forced activity is off the table.<br/><br/>I could be wrong, but the way you explain the problem makes it sound to me like the underlying situation <i>might</i> be that you're going through the motions because of memory. Life is too short. If you value these folks as friends, find some other way to express it, and move on. Or at least try a break and see how that makes you feel.<br/><br/>But, at bare minimum, you should <i>talk to your gaming group about this problem</i>, about what you're seeking to get out of RPGs, what fun you get out of RPGs, about what you're willing to try playing and not. If you're the only one in the group that has any interest in playing a game that's not part of the well-worn-stable-of-games-we've-been-playing-for-ten-years then that should be a clear sign that you're coming to an incommensurable situation here and you might be better off moving on.<br/><br/>These other folks have every much a right to say, "Nah, you know what? We call it Tuesday Night D&amp;D for a reason, and we really want to keep it that way" as you do to say, "Hey, you know what? D20 is cool and all, but I'd really like to try other games."<br/><br/>This is all part of negotiating the social contract at the gaming table, and sometimes (most times? all the time?) that contract needs explicit investigation and articulation to prevent people from growing resentment and un-fun.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: mease19</cite>How can we help you with this very important problem?<br/><br/>[Do you want game recommendations?  Help with transitioning from more traditional games? Suggestions for making d20 more interesting to you? etc.]</blockquote>\nAnd I also totally agree with this question. I don't think you've addressed it yet, and without knowing what it is you are seeking here, it's hard to really address your issue properly, so, I guess, take the screed above the blockquote with a massive grain of salt if it doesn't really address your current concern. 8)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312625">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Suna" title="Suna"><img alt="Suna" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Suna">Suna</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312625/#Comment_312625" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-15T07:23:10+00:00" title="February 15, 2011  7:23AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whenever I hear of people who prefer trad. games for being more realistic, I feel a great urge to ask them what exactly is realistic about it.

Really?<br/><br/>How about, they're having fun doing what they're doing and don't see any particular reason to try anything different? Not everyone wants their horizons widened; not everyone wants to "try something different" even if (sometimes especially if) someone else tries to convince them they can have <i>more</i> fun trying something different.<br/><br/>Imagine this was a sports issue instead of a hobby gaming issue. You have these guys who play street hockey every Saturday morning. They've done it for years. Then, one of the buddies plays in a summer soccer league and comes back and says "Hey guys! I like playing hockey with you all, but I <i>really</i> like soccer! So let's all go play soccer!"<br/><br/>I don't think anyone, really, would think it unreasonable that the Saturday morning street hockey gang says "No, thanks: sure I'll play a soccer game with you every now and then, but I really like playing street hockey, and I want to keep doing that, and I don't want to take 'the odd Saturday' away to play something else entirely."<br/><br/>We still don't know enough about this situation to really know what the problem really is. But at the very least, it involves the OP talking more the gaming group to try and get more detail on the table about what, how, and why they're having fun gaming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312631">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312631/#Comment_312631" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-15T07:45:56+00:00" title="February 15, 2011  7:45AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 15, 2011 7:47AM by Wordman.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Also, Apocalypse World is an easy sell to trad gamers.

Rather than trying to "wean them off" anything, it might be better to have a frank discussion amongst the group about whether they're having fun, how they're having fun, and how the group could adjust to accommodate the general goal of having more fun together. It could very well be that the answer is "we like this game, and we're not really interested in playing other things", and I don't think that's a bad thing.<br/><br/>There are so many questions that the OP just hasn't given us the answers to here. How long as this group been together? How old is everyone? What other interests do the members have? Do they hang out in other situations at all? Who does the GMing in this group (the OP? someone else? is the duty shared, and if so, how often does it rotate?) How often does this group "switch to a new campaign" or "adventure" (does it run campaigns for years, or switch every three months?) What other games has the group already tried?<br/><br/>I suspect we need more data about the situation, and about the OP's wants, and we need to not be so quick to judge that it's the playing group other than the OP that needs adjustment (or that it's the OP that needs adjustment -- if my own comments seem to lean in that direction, it's probably because I saw an awful lot of posts leaning in the opposite direction).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312634">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312634/#Comment_312634" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-15T08:04:23+00:00" title="February 15, 2011  8:04AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.plausiblydeniable.com/opinion/gsf.html" rel="nofollow">Geek social fallacies</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312635">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Suna" title="Suna"><img alt="Suna" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Suna">Suna</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312635/#Comment_312635" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-15T08:07:06+00:00" title="February 15, 2011  8:07AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, Viktor, I am.

Just because someone has fun playing one particular game and has no real desire to "expand one's perspective" I don't see as indicative that they are "brand-loyal" in the way that you seem to be suggesting.

I deliberately avoided asking for game suggestions, group help or sympathy because I am just generally interested in what people have to say. I really just needed to vent some frustration and I appreciate all the feedback. <br/><br/><b>More of my d20 rant</b><br/><br/>The thing that frustrates me about d20 (from what I've experienced in my group) is that the game my group thinks we are playing and the game they want to play isn't the game we are playing. They want to do awesome stuff, kill monsters and have crazy adventures. They want to be the heroes in an epic tale, but in reality we are participating in a bad comedy or even a comedic tragedy. The system doesn't lend itself to heroic triumph at crucial moments. It's possible, but as far as my experience goes, it rarely happens. The DM usually has to stretch the rules, get creative or show us lots of mercy to avoid killing our entire party. I'm tired of an NPC riding in at the last minute to save the party, it's ridiculous. Repeated failure just isn't fun. I just think that rather than kidding ourselves that this is what we want to play we could look for a system that creates the kind of stories we want to be in. Or, at very least the DM should be lowering the difficulty of the encounters we face. <br/><br/>I guess I just feel like players should have a sense of empowerment. I love the idea of 'failing forward.' <br/><br/>The realism in D&amp;D comes in the form of bad odds. You can do cool stuff but the chances that it will work out is low. The cooler the thing you can do, the less likely you will actually do it. Yes, this might be "realistic" but it isn't fun. It's challenging, but not in an enjoyable way (at least, not enjoyable to me). I just think that a 'hero' should be able to be heroic (not just lucky). Heroes in movies succeed far more than they fail, and the success or failure is dependent on the situation. They don't fail at crucial times and when they do fail it usually escalates the tension and creates a new challenge that is even more interesting than the one before. But in our games we 'miss' or 'fail' and that's it. To me, this is the biggest deficiency with the d20 system. I know that the DM has the opportunity to change this, but since it's not explicitly built into the system it doesn't happen for us, and I'm assuming that I'm not the only one having this experience.  <br/><br/><b>More about my group</b><br/><br/>I'm not going to pretend this is all the system's fault either. There are far more problems in our group than our choice of game. We just have differing ideas and preferences about gaming. I haven't outright talked to the entire group about trying another system and I'm sure they would be fine trying something out I just don't want to come across like some know-it-all. Most (maybe all) of them have far more years of experience gaming than I do. In a way, I feel more like I'm a guest in <i>their</i> group. <br/><br/>I'm not a hardcore proponent of story games either, by any means (my compulsion for 'misery tourism' is low). I'm not suggesting we play The Dance and the Dawn instead of D&amp;D, my tastes are fairly similar to theirs in genre and style. I would like it if we actually role-played a little more. There is almost no in-character dialogue in our games. In fact, in our last D&amp;D campaign our characters mysteriously awoke together in an unknown place, never having met before and we never even introduced ourselves. Three sessions later (after much fighting and puzzle solving) there was a break where we needed to split up some treasure and the DM mentioned that the two characters doing it didn't know each others names in-game (not to mention who they were or how they had gotten there). No one even seemed to realize this was a problem until then, but it was driving me crazy inside. <br/><br/>I intend to stay with this group, I don't know any other gamers, so I don't have another option. I will just work towards promoting the type of game play I want. I'm not intending to do it overtly either. I'm not even close to the most out-spoken in my group (which is part of my problem), so I will try to lead by example. They <i>are</i> open to trying new things, I just don't see them adopting anything permanently, and that's fine. They are good guys, just really bad gamers (in my opinion). And, for now, the social aspect of it is enough to keep me coming back.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312663">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312663/#Comment_312663" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-15T10:31:59+00:00" title="February 15, 2011 10:31AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: mjbauer</cite>I intend to stay with this group, I don't know any other gamers, so I don't have another option.</blockquote>\nI didn't either, but consider Meetup.com and there a couple more resources here:<br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/codex/index.php?title=Main_Page" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/codex/index.php?title=Main_Page</a><br/><br/>Or you can go remote, with Infrno, and Skype (a few of us who hang out here got a Skype game of Apocalypse World going together, for example).<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: mjbauer</cite>The cooler the thing you can do, the less likely you will actually do it.</blockquote>\nHear that.

Like you learn disintegrate but now you're always fighting creatures who make their saving throws. It took me a while to learn that the subtle spells that blind or otherwise cost the opponent a round or two are the game-changers, because it gives the barbarian and archer another full round of attacks.<br/><br/>And powers you have can be used in creative ways, that aren't direct. One of the absolute coolest moments in my Tuesday group's gaming over the past two years (the group started with 3.x then very briefly tried out 4e, then moved to PFRPG) was when they met up with a Roper: an encounter waaaay above their level, that was solidly kicking their asses because they tried the direct approach. One of the PCs died. Horribly. Then, one of the PC's cast a "Stone to Mud" spell or something on the cavern ceiling over the Roper's head. I looked up the "actual physics" of the spell just to get a general idea of what would happen. It turns out when you drop a couple tons of earth right onto the head of a creature, even if it's a really tough creature, it hurts a LOT.<br/><br/>There was nothing the group could have done to directly attack the Roper effectively (or very little), but that innovative use of a power that seemed directed more towards "how do I get past this obstacle to travel" had devastating effect, and an awesome moment of fun for everyone.<br/><br/>We're all still playing a D20 game (PFRPG) because we're having fun. My Wednesday night group is solidly playing 4e, again, because we're all having fun. Before that we played Reign, Burning Wheel, Spirit Of The Century, Dresden FIles (a bit) a bunch of other things. In that group's past is about a solid 10 year stretch of playing very little other than HERO.<br/><br/>So, sometimes a group can have a lot of fun by settling on a single "house system" and sticking with even though it might be fun to try other things. And sometimes a group can have a lot of fun by trying other things. What's important is to figure out what everyone wants to do for fun, and what they don't, and do more of the former and less of the latter.<br/><br/>System does matter. But it doesn't matter more than fun (imho).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312670">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mjbauer" title="mjbauer"><img alt="mjbauer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/222/nPG4NFOY76VNT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mjbauer">mjbauer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312670/#Comment_312670" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-15T11:08:22+00:00" title="February 15, 2011 11:08AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdfristrom</cite>It took me a while to learn that the subtle spells that blind or otherwise cost the opponent a round or two are the game-changers, because it gives the barbarian and archer another full round of attacks.</blockquote>\nI agree that part of the problem is my inexperience with the system and further, my lack of interest in learning it.

I hope it doesn't sound like I'm just whining because the modules we play are too hard. I am equally unimpressed with encounters that aren't challenging. I love a good high-tension situation, just not a hopeless one. But, it seems like gauging the difficulty of an encounter or challenge is nearly impossible with all the variables involved and the unknown addition of player improvisation.

From your longer explanation it sounds to me a bit like part of the problem you're experiencing is in a not very skillful use of the game rules. Most D20 games (if not all) are rich systems that present lots of knobs and wheels to turn, and players (and GMs) can definitely turn those knobs and wheels in ways that make for exciting encounters and stories, and in ways that don't have such awesome effects.<br/><br/>My experience with D20 (specifically the PFRPG and 4e incarnations of it) is not that it's fraught with failure and wasted attempts, nor rife with overwhelming encounters resulting in Deus Ex Machinae.<br/><br/>But, building good, balanced encounters isn't easy. And learning how to use the D20 skill system in ways that makes failure <i>interesting</i> isn't exactly obvious either.<br/><br/>You sound like you have a pretty good eye for the parts of the rules that aren't exactly producing successful results. I'd suggest two things: what can you do as a player to take action to prompt the solution of these issues at the table? (in the case of the scenario where it was bugging you that so much play was happening before player's characters really had any character-based interaction, what can you do at the table, as a player, to help address that issue?) Also, once you can get a grip on ways that GMing using these rules could be done in a concrete better way, then have you considered trying to GM <i>this game</i> for a while to see if your ideas can improve things?<br/><br/>I come from a group where the GMing role gets shared around pretty evenly and regularly. I learned some of what I do and don't do in that role from watching what the other guys did and trying to build on, or change, the bits I observed form their performances.<br/><br/>You can also try to "manage up" a bit -- try helping your GM get better by direct action at the table, or explanation between sessions, but that can also be a very tricky process. You can try to frame it in terms of your character: "Hey Bob; I think that in the next adventure my character might really like to do more of this kind of thing, and less of that kind of thing -- is that cool with you?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312674">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/XanatosChimera" title="XanatosChimera"><img alt="XanatosChimera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/XanatosChimera">XanatosChimera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312674/#Comment_312674" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-15T11:38:14+00:00" title="February 15, 2011 11:38AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have mixed opinions about d20.  An example from my own experience: I have played generally with groups that weren't the best.  I spent 3 hours putting together a Githyzerai Monk for the game (the other characters were Celestials and Infernals) and we came across a Boneyard (ambulatory graveyard) and later a juvenile Black Dragon.  The thing is that even with all the effort I put in, my knowledge of the system was pretty bad and I eneded up being pretty much ineffective compared to the rest of the group, I didn't go back after the first session.  The system mastery aspect isn't the issue (though I'm not motivated to put in the time to learn it for a tabletop RPG). Another example was I went simple and made a Pathfinder fighter using the standard array of scores.  That lasted 2 sessions, and was a bit more fun for the first session, but by the second session I was so bored with the game that I had my fighter do something stupid that got him blinded because it ended up being more interesting.  The basic problem was that either my fighter completely obliterated anything the attack connected with, which was about 1 successful hit per encounter, or could do nothing.  My checks for perception weren't that good, and none of the secondary skills I had chosen ever came into play.<br/><br/>But, I couldn't easily wrap my head around PDQ either.  Somehow Storyteller system came much easier to me than even AD&amp;D or GURPS which I played around with a whole bunch.  The meta-gaming aspect isn't what bugs me about 3.x, I actually find it great fun but I prefer it in computer games.  I'm playing DDO (a bit of a cross between 4.0 and 3.5) and I'm having fun playing with the feats and builds and deciding which things to take.  The thing is that computers are very very good at this kind of game because they can crunch the numbers really quickly so the mechanics can actually be more complex and involved than in a tabletop and the game runs faster.  DDO, Guild Wars, Diablo 2, even Diablo 1 all have min/maxing and power-gaming built in as assumptions.  Guild Wars, in particular is so well balanced that in PvP it really comes down to the skill of the player and knowing how to use and build your character rather than whether you have spent more time or money for gear etc. in the end though there is so much more that can be explored in tabletop than trying to replicate the feel and pace of Diablo or Torchlight dungeon crawls or Guild Wars campaigns.  It's better, I think, to leave dungeon craws and combat-heavy RPGs to computer-run mechanics and design for things that humans can do better.  PDQ does this (I will eventually get my paradigms shifted well enough to know what to do with the game) as do systems like Hero Quest, A Dirty World or even Smallville and Storyteller.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312680/#Comment_312680" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-15T12:11:28+00:00" title="February 15, 2011 12:11PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 15, 2011 12:11PM by walkerp.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Brand loyalty means they love the label, not what's in the can. d20 fans love what's in the can.

It seemed like a fun game; there was talk of a huge world to explore, people seemed excited about their characters, and the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">GM</span> DM as dropping hints about some huge plot for us to discover, as well.<br/><br/>However, when I made my character, the players all started harassing me, saying that he wasn't combat-ready enough. I hadn't taken enough combat feats, I guess. I stuck to my guns and made the character the way I saw him: kind of neat, charming social character, and well-designed for that.<br/><br/>Well, after a couple of sessions, the DM informed me that the problem was the opposite: my character wasn't inefficient, but too powerful. My character's social abilities were ruining his plot (I could detect lies very efficiently, for example), and could we please tone them down? I didn't mind, but the game didn't get any more fun when we did. <br/><br/>It didn't help that when I wanted to ask if my character was getting a sense that an NPC was lying, the DM would stop to make me roll for every single sentence of speech coming out of an NPC's mouth: it was a huge disincentive to actually use any of the abilities I'd designed my character to have.<br/><br/>Anyway, all that to say:<br/><br/>How strong is the GM-role in this group? Does the GM have full say over what gets played next, and authority to do so?<br/><br/>In many groups I've played in, the GM's word is law. So if you're running a game, you get to call all the shots: what system is in use, when we meet, etc.<br/><br/>In that case, you should talk to them and ask if you can start up another game.<br/><br/>The best option for gauging their interest in a different kind of game might be to run a really fun one-shot of some other system, and then ask them afterwards if they'd like to do something similar on a regular basis (a monthly one-shot?) or extend that one-shot into an ongoing game/campaign.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312785">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Suna" title="Suna"><img alt="Suna" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Suna">Suna</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312785/#Comment_312785" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-16T00:12:03+00:00" title="February 16, 2011 12:12AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Micah, have you read Jason's comment/link?<br/>I think you should.

And now, I've been in the group long enough that I do enjoy their company, if not their gaming. There are other factors too, but I don't really want to go into everything here. <br/><br/>Thanks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312932">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312932/#Comment_312932" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-16T14:16:30+00:00" title="February 16, 2011  2:16PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><cite>Posted By: walkerp</cite>Witness the direct migration by many groups from 3.5 to 4e, no questions asked beyond "what's the release schedule"?</blockquote>\nThose are D&amp;D fans?

This is the guy who loves working his way out of a problem with nothing but a floating disk spell, cantrips, two candles and a bag of holding. Are any of those in your group?</blockquote>\nErr, I thought this was the type of player who refused to play 3e because you could no longer do it like you could in AD&amp;D. Improvisation was killed pretty dead by d20 RAW, and if you have the flexibility to allow it in d20, then you've got the flexibility to do it in 4e. That would sound more like the type of player who just started playing d20 and goes with the flow, and then looked at the 4e rules in detail, and saw them conflicting with what he already did, not realising he never read the d20 rules either.<br/><br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: mjbauer</cite>The thing that frustrates me about d20 (from what I've experienced in my group) is that the game my group thinks we are playing and the game they want to play isn't the game we are playing. They want to do awesome stuff, kill monsters and have crazy adventures. They want to be the heroes in an epic tale, but in reality we are participating in a bad comedy or even a comedic tragedy. The system doesn't lend itself to heroic triumph at crucial moments. It's possible, but as far as my experience goes, it rarely happens. The DM usually has to stretch the rules, get creative or show us lots of mercy to avoid killing our entire party. I'm tired of an NPC riding in at the last minute to save the party, it's ridiculous. Repeated failure just isn't fun. I just think that rather than kidding ourselves that this is what we want to play we could look for a system that creates the kind of stories we want to be in. Or, at very least the DM should be lowering the difficulty of the encounters we face.</blockquote>\nThis is entirely logical, D&amp;D was never designed to be like that, that's just how it ended up getting marketed, because it was appealing to people who read fantasy novels. It's also why Dragonlance 5th Age got created with the SAGA system. It's going to be pretty hard to find another system that consistently gives that to you, because most systems still use dice. SAGA uses cards, has a very low failure rate, and in my experience has been a ton of fun. Using dice is more suitable to something like Call of Cthulhu.<br/><br/>I haven't played Exalted, but it might be a good pitch. If you describe an awesome stunt, you get extra dice. Extra dice means you have a greater chance of success. Of course that ends up bringing in a realism quibble, but there's an easy fix by saying a 1 on any of your extra dice is a complication, and a 1 without any successes is a total botch. Then you have it where you do awesome stuff you increase your chance of success, but you are also risking something.<br/><br/>Other than that, you might have to houserule in D20 Modern's action points, and give a healthy amount of them, with each point either being a re-roll or +1d6. Of course that's really a band-aid rather than a solution, but it'd probably be the easiest thing to bring back that feeling of heroism. Particularly if all the players save their action points for the big show down, then things will end up being as epic as they were imagined.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_313320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/framweard" title="framweard"><img alt="framweard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/framweard">framweard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313320/#Comment_313320" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-19T02:47:37+00:00" title="February 19, 2011  2:47AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My suggestion is to check out Burning Wheel Revised. If you like it, share it. Be excited, offer to run it once, do some character generation and collaborative world-building. Draw some maps, sketch out some Beliefs, Instincts, and Traits. Maybe run The Sword or something (The Sword being an intro scenario for Burning Wheel). If what you say is true, and they aren't playing the game they think they're playing (the game about being big damn fantasy heroes driven by what they believe), they'll probably bite when you show them Burning Wheel. Maybe they'll be more interested in other story games after that. Maybe you'll play Burning Wheel once and it will merely serve as a diagnostic for how to make d20 more fun for your group (which is exactly what happened with my old group, in fact).

Hell, your PCs are starting off on about the same level as the heroes of House of Flying Daggers or Once Upon A Time in China.  I assume you mean realism quibble as being the more complicated move having a lower chance of failing than the standard action?  Exalted, iirc, uses a modified form of the Storyteller system from 2nd Edition World of Darkness (oWoD), so they still include the modified rule of one: no successes in the pool and one or more 1s results in a botch.  No matter how big your pool is you have a chance of botching something stunt or no.  The proposed houserule about 1s on the stunt dice is a very interesting idea.  I should see if I can test it out in either Scion or Exalted starter adventures, assuming I can find anyone to play Storyteller in this d20-D&amp;D/clone dominated frozen city  :S.<br/><br/>There's the slight issue that from 1d to 2d pools the odds of a botch actually increase a little, then drop again.  I suppose, you could simply rule out botches on any check not involving stunt dice or involving a chance die (pool has been reduce to 0 or less, where 10 only is a success, and 1 is a botch as nWoD Storyteller runs it).<br/><br/>Fusing d20 with an Alternity/Earthdawn step-die system might also work.  For example rolling 1d20+1d4 vs DC12 (average task), you can say that only snake-eyes equals a crit fail.  As the character gets more competent or powerful they add larger polyhedrals to the d20 roll.  The chance of a botch on d20+d4 is 1/80, +d6 has a 1/120, +d8 1/160... this reflects the ability to try harder and harder things.  You could base the bonus die off the check modifier (D&amp;D Unearthed Arcana had this as an optional rule, apparantly.  +3=1d4, +4=1d6 etc...)                        </div>\n<div

viktor_haag&lt;/cite&gt;Also, once you can get a grip on ways that GMing using these rules could be done in a concrete better way, then have you considered trying to GM&lt;i&gt;this game&lt;/i&gt;for a while to see if your ideas can improve things?&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI was just about to suggest this. Can you run D&amp;D; to address the failings that you see in it? There's a few ideas in the posts above, from the wooly (increased player input in world-building and background) to the concrete (bring in action points from D20 Modern, check out some of the stuff in Unearthed Arcana). Even if this doesn't address your system issues, in my experience GMing and playing D&amp;D; are completely different experiences - and what you're bothered by might not bother you as much from the GM's chair - and it sounds like the rest of your group are cool with it as it is. Failing that, have a look at some nearly-D&amp;D; systems that might not have your issues so up-front-and-centre - something OSR like Labyrinth Lord might focus you on what aspects of D20 you actually do like, or Fantasy Craft or True20 might be just different enough to keep your group happy while addressing some of your concerns (I share a lot of the concerns you raise, and I reckon FC meets a lot of them directly).<br/>\n<br/>\nI realise this might not be the flash-of-light inspirational solution that you might have wanted to hear, but it might be a way to continue playing with this group - which I take it you enjoy playing with, system aside? And second (third? fourth?) the suggestion you scratch your indie itch over some PbF / skype / meetup group as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_313436">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313436/#Comment_313436" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-20T13:14:03+00:00" title="February 20, 2011  1:14PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Any of the OSR games I think are a really <b>bad</b> recommendation. I realise a lot of people have nostalgia and therefore like the systems, but specifically what mjbauer was complaining about was the lack of heroism. It might not be explicitly stated in the game texts, but everyone who talks about them certainly points out that old school characters were disposable and not supposed to be particularly special at all, and a lot of people go to OSR games to get characters that are less powerful than in d20 versions.<br><br>FantasyCraft, while interesting, I don't think really solves that issue either. From what I've read of it, the base mechanics are still the same, which lend themselves to failure. It's almost like Pathfinder might be the best pick because it got some power creep going, so all the characters are slightly more powerful.<br><br>The other thing would be to look at character optimisation, and play styles that support it. Thanks to saving throws, the spells for wizards that are useful are the buffs and debuffs, so figuring out that strategy to make enemies weaker while allies are stronger would increase the success, but it changes the narrative. If it's the actual success that matters, that might be the solution, but if it's also the action you take that matters, then some of those optimisations can seem quite unheroic.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_313440">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313440/#Comment_313440" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-20T13:44:26+00:00" title="February 20, 2011  1:44PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: migo</cite>FantasyCraft, while interesting, I don't think really solves that issue either.

Its a question of presentation. If you, as the GM, throw the group against something you know they can trounce, but you make it sound like they can't contextually, then... there's the badassery. Spend the first half of the session talking about how terrible this orc tribe is. Have the guard go out before them and get their asses handed to them. Let the PC's plan and work up just how they're going to assault the orc tribe, and then have the actual orcs be slightly under par for their power level and the PC's will come in and beat everyone down pretty handily. If you spread out enough ad hoc/optional XP awards or have enough other encounters to pad out the main combat, then the XP curve should feel about right.<br/><br/>I mean, nothing ever felt as heroic to me as not dying when playing low level D&amp;D guys, but thats because I played with people who used that threat of death well. It was just there, if you died, that sucked, but if you didn't die, thats where the real fun was. Games like Exalted and Werewolf on the other hand, though I love things about both (espescially werewolf) always left me feeling sort of "meh" in terms of the heroism.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_313464">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313464/#Comment_313464" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-20T19:36:11+00:00" title="February 20, 2011  7:36PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure it can, that's exactly what the SAGA system set out to do, and it did it very well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_313467">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313467/#Comment_313467" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-20T20:12:33+00:00" title="February 20, 2011  8:12PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Apocalypse World, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_313468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313468/#Comment_313468" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-20T20:59:07+00:00" title="February 20, 2011  8:59PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            SAGA as in the card based Dragonlance 5th Age/Marvel Superheroes... There is no way that crunching the numbers associated with that game will make something feel heroic... it still takes descriptions and context. I've never played Apocalypse World, but crunching those numbers probably ain't all that heroic either... and all I can say is that I've played a lot of D&amp;D that seemed pretty heroic, and I don't know that the system works against these things. Hit Points, once you have a few, are pretty heroic. Magic Items, once upon a time, before numbers inflation ruined it in later edition, felt pretty heroic. Now, I guess I'm being a little unfair because we're talking about D20, which I guess doesn't include AD&amp;D or earlier editions, and in playing D20 I can honestly say that I often felt pretty un-heroic... but once again, I think that was context. I think in running the game, you can set things up so that they feel pretty heroic without the system necessarily working against you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_313469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313469/#Comment_313469" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-20T21:14:27+00:00" title="February 20, 2011  9:14PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's not the crunching the numbers, it's that you save the high cards and trump cards for important events so when it's important for you to win, you actually do win.

If you use those high cards too early you're left with a hand full of low cards that you have to wait to use or burn on useless tasks in order to build a better hand. Also in SAGA, injury could be a lot more punitive as it decreased your hand size and therefore your effectiveness. And heroism doesn't always equal success. Unless probability's really working against you, D&amp;D veers towards the heroic. Even level appropriate challenges are intended to be won. Failing a single roll or even losing a fight and being forced to retreat will still probably end up with you saving the day. Plus, with Feats and Class Features your almost always extremely good at the one or two things your character does well... way better than an average person. There's something heroic about being a 16 year old village yokel who's also the best archer in the country or who knows more ancient lore than the cities' sages. Plus, action points were a built in feature in D20 modern and an optional one introduced in Unearthed Arcana. There's also all of the luck based rules in the (I think) Scoundrel's book. Plus various spells (Bless, Swift Strike) all work to balance out the dice mechanic and give the PC's extra chance for success.<br/><br/>When talking about d20 (and when I do I'm normally limiting myself to items that officially brand themselves as d20 products and within that milieu focusing on the WOTC stuff over 3rd Party)... your looking a tool set that can be used to run a fairly wide range of games in terms of tone and content. I think the easiest tone to capture is a sort of "cinematic" heroism where your guys kind of boulder through most challenges. There are ways to focus the system so that it works well for the "overcoming insurmountable odds" type of play I think your describing when saying heroic/heroism. Spell casters and other limited resources types are especially good for this sort of play (their good spells are essentially their "high cards" that are being saved for later use).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_313475">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313475/#Comment_313475" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-20T22:23:30+00:00" title="February 20, 2011 10:23PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you use the high cards early, it's your own fault for wasting it on something unimportant. That's not a flaw at all, that's how you'd hope something works, just like with dice you'd hope your low rolls are for actions that don't matter as much. For injury, if you'd been saving high cards you could just use that single one to soak up the damage, making it not much of a deal, or alternatively use some of your low cards and take more damage but spend your high one on a counter attack. Besides, given people think about realism, having injury affect your ability to do something makes a lot of sense. It's easier than implementing Cyberpunk's death spiral. <br/><br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: masqueradeball</cite>Unless probability's really working against you, D&amp;D veers towards the heroic. Even level appropriate challenges are intended to be won.</blockquote>\nThe problem is, probabilities have a tendency of working against you, because it's across 50,000 rolls, not the at max a few hundred that you'd make throughout an adventure. Several bad rolls in a single encounter is quite feasible and can completely take you out. Using cards avoids this, as the probabilities are actually controlled.<br/><br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: masqueradeball</cite>There's something heroic about being a 16 year old village yokel who's also the best archer in the country or who knows more ancient lore than the cities' sages.</blockquote>\nThat's not what I think of when I think heroic. Heroism isn't about what you theoretically can do, it's about what you actually do. If you defeat the demon sealing him away so he can no longer rain terror upon the world, you're a hero, and it doesn't matter if you were a sharpshooter or a barmaid who pulled it off. It's the action that is heroic, and if you roll a 1, your sharpshooter ends up decidedly unheroic. That's a problem that'll never be solved with AD&amp;D, D20, 4E, BRP, or any related system. Dice are random, and they tell their own stories. If you want a specific story, the dice based system is always going to get in the way of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_313476">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313476/#Comment_313476" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-20T22:34:09+00:00" title="February 20, 2011 10:34PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: masqueradeball</cite>I mean, I think feeling badass is something a game mechanic can't really do on its own.

The mechanics will often define what an everyday person and/or orc are - saying what an average stat is.

For example, a player character swings at an easy target and rolls really badly.  Some systems will define a fumble where you can injure yourself or others.  Some systems, though, you may still get a limited success even if you roll the minimum.  Also, some systems have hero point systems that let you boost or reroll bad rolls.  <br/><br/>Conversely, in a card system - if you have a shitty hand of cards and furthermore save the few OK cards you have, then you're going to fumble around a whole lot against pissant challenges - which doesn't make you look very badass.  However, the hand of cards does have some effect of mitigating the effect of bad rolls by letting you choose when to use low cards.  <br/><br/>I think there is a lot that can be done with mechanics to set expectations and create bad-assery.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_313477">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313477/#Comment_313477" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-20T22:43:07+00:00" title="February 20, 2011 10:43PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's not what happens in practice with SAGA. I've played through a few sessions and there were about 5% failures, even with low cards. You have the choice to approach something the way you want to, which means you take actions which you have a good chance of success at, which means you have at least a 5 in the related ability. Average actions need an 8 or higher, so as long as you're having your character doing something he's good at, he'll succeed the vast majority of the time. Also, if you've got a lot of low cards, some of them will be trump, so it still works out.<br/><br/>It could vary from system to system, but in SAGA in particular, which is designed so you are heroic, and to specifically avoid the pitfalls of dice, failure is rare, and when present, is either because you didn't care that much about the action, or because it's something your character wasn't good at. <br/><br/>Even using D20M's system of +1d6 for an action point, if you've got an action you need a 5 or higher to succeed on, and you roll a 1, you could still end up failing while spending that action point. The only way to really make that work is rather than having it be +1d6, just make it so that spending a point means an action automatically gets bumped to a minimal success. Then you've got your resource of making sure that you succeed when you need to, even if the dice say otherwise. Easiest solution without switching systems, but if you want to have that integrated into the system, card based is the best.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_313478">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313478/#Comment_313478" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-20T23:08:27+00:00" title="February 20, 2011 11:08PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            SAGA can fuck you so easily. If you happen to draw five bad cards when the important shit comes up, you have bad cards. You can crib your actions based on the cards, but that's a strange and unnatural way to pace a story or a character's actions.<br/><br/>I'm not saying that I don't like SAGA, I love it (the Dragonlance one anyway) but it has... problems. Problems that specifically come up with the way having certain cards in your hand means your characters has to act a certain way, which is weird. In D&amp;D, at least, there's a chance, and in the realm of attack rolls and saves, theres always a 5% chance that you'll succeed, no matter how the statistics weigh against you. This is opposed to having a hand full of low cards of inappropriate suits when your fighting the big bad. Your going to miss or lose at least once, and depending on where the other high cards are (like in the hands of other players) you may never get the card you need. The trump system mitigates this, but in the first session of SAGA I played I had characters fishing around for chances to throw away their low cards on throw away actions. This is a shitty thing to have a game encourage in play... not that D20 doesn't encourage its own shit, because god knows that it does, I just don't think one is specifically better defined for heroism, using any definition of the word.<br/><br/>And if heroism= success, then the infinite power of the DM can always make sure the PC's are heroic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_313484">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313484/#Comment_313484" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-21T00:30:18+00:00" title="February 21, 2011 12:30AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're not going to be dropped into the climax right from the start. You'll have some unimportant stuff to burn some of those cards with, and at least one of them will be trump. Hell, anyone with an A or B in perception would just need to make a relevant perception check at easy and would be guaranteed a success even with a 1. Any spellcaster who managed to draw 5 1s could cast a minor spell that only costs 4 points, with no opposed target. Boom, card spent. Even if it's in combat, you throw a card out that you know will miss on the attack, and see what comes up in place of it for defense that follows.<br/><br/>Your problem is that you're thinking about SAGA in an unrealistic, theoretical situation that doesn't actually happen and you're also thinking about D20 in an unrealistic, theoretical situation that doesn't actually happen. Just you're biased in thinking about worst case scenario for SAGA and best for D20.<br/><br/>I'm not bringing up low rolls out of the blue, I'm bringing up low rolls turning a heroic epic into a tragic comedy because that's what mjbauer said was happening. That's reality, it's not theoretical, and it's not even that uncommon. The reality of SAGA is that the vast majority of actions are successes. Hell, even my girlfriend who played cards based on who they were, rather than based on the number or suit ended up succeeding the vast majority of the time. Her failures were related to being a handler, and the person she randomly met being someone who didn't like that she'd stolen from him (turning over a black card from the deck). That was part of the character, and made it interesting because it was expected to happen. If you've got a character with 9A in Swords, they're a master fighter, carrying in a heavy weapon that does a load of extra damage, and will be automatically hitting anyone not wearing armour (as that would be vs difficulty 8). Even with that example of 5 1s you brought up, that warrior would slaughter a noncombatant. In d20, you can still roll a 1 and miss against a single Kobold even when your character concept says you're a master swordsman. <br/><br/>You're not going to have a bunch of low cards in inapropriate suits when you're fighting the big bad, because you were reserved earlier on the adventure, taking some knocks to keep a couple high or trump cards for when you really needed it against the big bad. Of course what that does is effectively reduce you from a 5 card hand to a 3 card hand until you have the final show down, but that's keeping your successes for when it's important.<br/><br/>I don't see anything wrong with finding ways to throw away the cards, that only really comes from some masochistic desire to not be successful. The system was specifically designed so that you could throw away the low cards and fail at some unimportant stuff. You've got 5 ones, walk into the bar, challenge someone to a game of darts, you use the 1, obviously lose, buy the guy a drink (or an entire round for everyone!) and make some friends. You were finding a way to get rid of the low cards, and an interesting roleplaying opportunity came up. That's a good thing, not a bad. It generally fleshes out the story because you're also dealing with day to day events.<br/><br/>Nobody wants DM-ex machina guaranteeing their success, they want it to be through their own actions, even if it's a straight forward strategy of saving Malysteryx for the final showdown.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_313490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Millsy" title="Millsy"><img alt="Millsy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Millsy">Millsy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313490/#Comment_313490" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-21T03:45:48+00:00" title="February 21, 2011  3:45AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Posted By: migo&lt;/cite&gt;Even using D20M's system of +1d6 for an action point, if you've got an action you need a 5 or higher to succeed on, and you roll a 1, you could still end up failing while spending that action point.

This makes it highly likely you'll succeed at a normal task and gives you a good shot at even a difficult roll - and you can spend it after you've rolled, so you can see if you've succeeded anyway first. It's also got a 'GM Fiat' rule where the GM can do this - but they have to give a Hero Point to the most appropriate PC. In the context of M&amp;M;, where you roll damage saves on a d20 to see if you're taken out of combat or survive, it creates a nice pacing mechanic similar to the one we're disagreeing about in SAGA. Granted, these aren't particularly subtle ways to increase player agency or feelings of badassery in the OP's games, but I think we might be trying to work within the comfort zone of the OP's group - I certainly am - and that might be a good or a bad thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy personal experience of D20 is that I get pissed off GMing it - the way the system encourages players to scrimp and save, the difficulties of balancing antagonists to the party, the frequency of failure (and, in combat, very very incremental success) - but don't mind it as a player.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_313496">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313496/#Comment_313496" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-21T07:56:57+00:00" title="February 21, 2011  7:56AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I know it's kind of old hat at this point, but the concept of task vs. conflict resolution applies to this portion of the discussion.

This makes it highly likely you'll succeed at a normal task and gives you a good shot at even a difficult roll - and you can spend it after you've rolled, so you can see if you've succeeded anyway first. It's also got a 'GM Fiat' rule where the GM can do this - but they have to give a Hero Point to the most appropriate PC.</blockquote>\nThat's certainly an improvement over d20m, although I'm thinking a +10 would almost be better so you could succeed at something you normally shouldn't be able to. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Millsy</cite>Granted, these aren't particularly subtle ways to increase player agency or feelings of badassery in the OP's games, but I think we might be trying to work within the comfort zone of the OP's group - I certainly am - and that might be a good or a bad thing.</blockquote>\nOh, I agree, a hack for d20 I think is certainly a better option than switching systems entirely, but I was bringing up SAGA to show that you could have a system that really does lead to heroism.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>The guy has a problem with his group, the system is not the issue, it never, ever, ever, ever, ever is.</blockquote>\nNo, he specifically mentioned a lack of heroism and tragic comedy instead due to dice results.

You know how to set up adventures and manipulate the cards so that the players will have the resources that they need to pull out the big guns when they need to. What I'm saying is that the same level of proficiency with the d20 system will produce similar results. I definitely know players who can build their characters that can consistently out perform expectations.

The system seems to naturally lend itself well to players having good cards for important showdowns, and seems to appeal to all types. My girlfriend doesn't really grok AD&amp;D, or FASA Star Trek, while my brother does. Conversely my girlfriend instantly got Zorcerer of Zo, while I had to pull the book out of my brother's hands and tell him to just write some stuff down for his character. They're coming from quite different ends of the spectrum in terms of expectations and play style, and yet when I ran SAGA for them, they both picked it up easily.<br><br>I think the amount of work necessary to make SAGA create heroic show-downs is less than the kind of extra work necessary in AD&amp;D or D20, and I say that having far more proficiency in AD&amp;D, and even D20 than I do with SAGA. Mechanically D20 supports dungeon crawling quite well, it doesn't support heroic story telling nearly as well. SAGA doesn't support a dungeon crawl all that well, but it supports heroic storytelling really well. It's not just the skill of the players and the GM, because historically D&amp;D wasn't designed for heroic exploits, in fact it is more of a system that's balanced for heroes and villains, and mechanically D20 isn't all that different and shares those same qualities.<br/><br/>Of course what this means is in an arena type battle where you have some players controlling villains and others controlling heroes, there's an even chance for both sides, but a 50% chance of the villains winning makes for a decidedly unheroic outcome.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_313563">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313563/#Comment_313563" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-21T18:15:41+00:00" title="February 21, 2011  6:15PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, in general I think SAGA is a better system and I think its focus is more about producing good drama than good tactical combat/mixed-realism.

Dungeons and Dragons, to me, has always been about being able to die because you walked into a room filled with killer spores and didn't roll well enough on your d20. It felt like a fantasy story, and you could die easily, but the funny thing is, unless I really fucked up as a GM, no one ever really did die, or lose... they just sort of changed and grew and became stranger and more powerful and it was awesome and strange way surreal.<br/><br/>Now granted, newer editions focus on something else and that something may be touted as heroism by the marketing people at WOTC/Paizo, but I don't think its the kind of heroism you're talking about here. I think its what I mentioned before... growing from a wimp to an uber-bad-ass, having a cool sounding array of powers and options, etc...<br/><br/>Also, you're using a very personal definition of heroism.<br/><br/>And, no you can't sit down and talk about preferences about a game system without talking about their relative merits and flaws, but if I were you and I were talking to D&amp;D/D20 fans I would be careful to make it clear that what's really at issue is how the game makes you feel during play, or how the game contributes to those feeling and not to slight the game itself. It sound like what your saying is that the D20's unpredictability really ruins "heroic moments" for you and you want a way to mitigate that.<br/><br/>An honest suggestion, get card dice. I forget who made them but its a deck of cards that has 1-20 printed on them and you draw a card at random instead of rolling, but you don't shuffle in between draws so that you have both a guarantee of getting an evenly distributed spread of results and so that you can predict what kind of mojo you have left and can base your decisions around that knowledge.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_313775">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313775/#Comment_313775" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-22T15:52:50+00:00" title="February 22, 2011  3:52PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've only seen 2d6 decks of cards, but a d20 deck would also be pretty sweet.

It has always been marketed very explicitly as a game of heroic epic fantasy. In actual play, it may work as the story of "growing from a wimp to an uber-bad-ass", but they have certainly never sold it by saying "you start out as weak and ineffectual! and you'll probably die a lot! but if you're lucky, you may get to be a cool powerful bad-ass eventually!" They market and sell it as "you can be Conan! and Merlin! and Aragorn!" Just a glance at any of the illustrated book covers or other promotional artwork makes that clear, if nothing else.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_313808">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313808/#Comment_313808" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-23T00:26:25+00:00" title="February 23, 2011 12:26AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Always... really? I think the AD&amp;D product line gives a pretty clear guideline of what to expect. Historical simulation + Magical Adventure + Dungeons with spores that can kill you if you don't roll high enough on your d20. And most of the D&amp;D covers I remember show dudes charging into combat... not winning fights or saving people or doing anything else. The heroism in D&amp;D seems to be all about charging in and facing the unknown, not necessarily about overcoming it. The art captured that moment just before you knew what would happen. It was big and magic but not inspiring. Dragonlance was introduced specifically to change that about D&amp;D and to learn how to use the game to tell epic stories, and I think, in part, its why its never quite fit with the mechanics that gave it birth. Somewhere along the line people mixed up D&amp;D with something that wasn't/isn't there in the books.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_313809">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313809/#Comment_313809" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-23T00:28:25+00:00" title="February 23, 2011 12:28AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And those people worked at TSR.

The heroism in D&amp;D seems to be all about charging in and facing the unknown, not necessarily about overcoming it. The art captured that moment just before you knew what would happen. It was big and magic but not inspiring.</blockquote>\nI don't see how you think that art is not inspiring heroism. Charging in to face the big fight against the dragon, to take just one example cover (red box D&amp;D, Mentzer (1983) edition), is heroic, as you clearly agree. <br/><br/>The text of the game may give a clear guideline of what to expect\u2014although "historical simulation" really isn't it, either\u2014but the text of the game is not marketing. The cover art, the cover blurbs, magazine advertisements, posters, TV commercials\u2026 that's marketing, and it's selling the experience of "Your mighty warrior yells his battle-cry and charges forward, swinging his sword at the deadly dragon looming over a vast bed of treasure!"<br/><br/>What the promotional artwork and marketing has certainly never shown, or tried to sell the game by, is "you walked into a room filled with killer spores and you didn't roll well enough on your d20, so you die, everything you've done is lost, start over." Because that's crap. No one starts playing the game for that. They start playing because the game promises the adventures of Conan, of King Arthur, of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>. <br/><br/>Some of the interior artwork reflects the actual experience of the game, yes. But to claim that that's how it's marketed, or that that's the experience the promotional artwork is showing, is just flat-out wrong.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_313816">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313816/#Comment_313816" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-23T02:33:00+00:00" title="February 23, 2011  2:33AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If it adds anything to the debate I think it's worth noting that there are also at least two or three <i>different games</i> implicitly contained within each edition of D&amp;D (the only exceptions to this are the original booklets and the Basic sets if you opt not to use the Expert expansions). 4E made this more obvious with its distinction between the heroic, paragon and epic levels. <br/><br/>In other words, when you play (A)D&amp;D at level 3 you're not playing the same game as on level 12 or level 19. This is also revealed in the common complaint that "Hey this game has dragons in the title, how come we never fight any dragons?". I've tried to visually represent the issue <a href="http://redmoosegames.blogspot.com/2010/11/fantasy-superheroes.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. And <a href="http://www.thealexandrian.net/creations/misc/d&amp;d-calibrating.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>'s that very old essay by Justin Alexander in which he convincingly establishes (about 3/4s down) that Aragorn is in fact level 5. That was met by much teeth grinding back then, but it's true. It was true even before 3rd ed.<br/><br/>Yeah, the dude fighting a dragon on the Mentzner box is a <i>promise</i>. The reality is your friend gets killed by Bargle a few minutes in (the game's saying: so can <i>you</i>). You could say fighting a dragon is a reward for surviving the rats and poison needles and killer bees, but I'm not sure that's entirely accurate. I think it's more along the lines of D&amp;D being a kitchensink of influences - Gary and Dave read both Vance and Howard. Here you have in this game your chance to play both Cugel and Conan. Leveling up is a way to establish some continuity between the two (and well, after a certain level even Conan will look puny).<br/><br/>[and as much as we'd like to treat D&amp;D as one monolithic entity, there's also the fact that there are some big emergent differences between editions and versions]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_313826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313826/#Comment_313826" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-23T04:54:00+00:00" title="February 23, 2011  4:54AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, my interpretation of art is flat out wrong.

I just think that for a long time most of the fiction and art that surrounded the D&amp;D game was specifically D&amp;D fiction and art that has little to do with other types of fantasies or stories. I think that D&amp;D sells a genre that is unique to D&amp;D, and I think it does it well. What D&amp;D's ads seem to offer is challenge and the fantasy of power within the confines of a game that dresses itself up in medieval fantasy trappings. Think about the cover art for the AD&amp;D player's handbook, or dungeon master's guide. Think about the little interior doodles of wizards in dungeons in the really early D&amp;D books. Look at all most all of the interior art for the 2nd edition line, or the cover design for 3e. It's weird, its compelling, and its uniquely D&amp;D. I never felt that it offered the promise of the kinds of story/drama that you seem to be seeking, migo. This is my personal take... I can back it up with specific examples and evidence, but I think this thread is has been seriously taken off course. If we want to talk about "what D&amp;D means to me" or "what does D&amp;D promise but fails to deliver" maybe we should start another thread.<br/><br/>Also, just to be clear, I'm not saying that I think its unreasonable that you or anyone else wants/expects D&amp;D to do things that it doesn't or that they came to those wants/expectations through the way that TSR/WOTC markets their materials. What I am saying is that I don't think the makers of D&amp;D ever tried to sell any body a bill of goods that they couldn't deliver. I honestly think that gynax/arnesen/menser/cook/et al. are competent enough game designers that with enough time effort they could make a game that produces that kind of heroism and they just didn't want to (at least not inside the scope of their D&amp;D output).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_313993">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313993/#Comment_313993" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-23T16:10:39+00:00" title="February 23, 2011  4:10PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It also bears mentioning that at various points, many many different people were involved in the creation of D&amp;D, so what D&amp;D3 promised in, say, 2001, might not be what someone new coming on board in 2003 wanted to deliver.
