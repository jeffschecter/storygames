This sort of badge of self-identification that sets the "Indie" folks seperate from everyone else.<br/><br/>As some of you know, I was once told on The Forge, that I wasn't "Indie", mostly because I work with d20 in addition to my original designs.    Sadly, I heard this said in a discussion at GenCon as well, at the IPR booth, in reference to another small-press publisher....specifically saying that his company would not be welcome at the booth, because they "weren't Indie enough."<br/><br/>I also had the misfortune of having someone relate a conversation back to me, wherein a third party was apparently critizing me for being a "carpetbagger", because I was coming in, taking the FATE system, and using it for a "commercial" product (Far West).     Like I am somehow "The Man",  cherry-picking from the Indie movement, just so I can sell it to the masses.  I was told by the relator that I should expect a cold shoulder from "Indie" fans when FAR WEST is released, because they know that "I'm not one of them."<br/><br/>In another instance, I was on a shuttle bus, talking about my plans for Adamant with someone I had just met, who self-identifies as part of the "Indie" community.  He took the opportunity to lecture me on the fact that "The Supplement Treadmill Is DEATH."    And, when I pointed out that I was aware of this bit of Ron-Edwards opinion, he shook his head and told me that I obviously "just don't get it, because I'm in the industry."<br/><br/>What the fuck?<br/><br/>Even a positive event, like the ENNies, I've heard described (by Indie folks) as "being allowed to sit at the Cool Kids table" or "being asked to play with the Big Kids."   Come on.<br/><br/>This is a false division, kids.    We're all small-time.    The entire games industry is a pimple on the ass of the entertainment industry as a whole.   We're not nearly big enough to be divided into "Corporate Whores" and "Punk Kids."      Not to mention that ALL of the companies in this business, even the largest, started out as basement-press efforts by gamers.<br/><br/>Enough with the attitude.    That's all I'm trying to say.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90169">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/blankshield" title="blankshield"><img alt="blankshield" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.blankshieldpress.com/jamesgoplay.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/blankshield">blankshield</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90169/#Comment_90169" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-24T12:36:14+00:00" title="August 24, 2007 12:36PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really want to know who is spreading this kind of crap on the carpet.

Yeah, perhaps it's a tad absurd in an industry that, as you rightly point out, has all of it's starts in basements. And certainly there are going to be moments where people decide to have an attitude where it's just not warranted. Cases where people use it to create group identity (no matter how odd it is, the concept of an "indie" group). But there you have it, that's just people. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo to some extent, Gareth, you're probably due an apollogy. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut... I think that the attitude, where it's used to give the author a little strength to resist the urge to sell out, is a good thing. Or do you think that "indie" is just ridiculous, and has no place in RPGs at all? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn another, more personal note Gareth, there are some who might claim that you, yourself, have an attitude of your own. And, while that might not justify certain attacks made on you, to some extent I think that you tend to reap what you sow. I do, too, to some extent, but I'm a bit more sanguine about it, apparently. You have an extrememly strong personality, and that's, unfortunately, going to make you specifically a target. <br/>\n<br/>\nI like your work, and I don't think that you're beholden to anyone in any way that the indie movement fights. That's my opinion. If I was running a booth or something, your products would be welcome. I'm guessing that Fred, ever sensible, has no problem with your pedigree. Not everyone is against you. So... is there any real harm you're experiencing? C'mon, you're not going to let some pissant punks disturb you with this, are ya? <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90183">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90183/#Comment_90183" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-24T13:03:07+00:00" title="August 24, 2007  1:03PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Given all the enthusiasm here on the board for D&amp;D 4e, I hope you can see that it must be a very small minority that holds such opinions.

That's not helpful. It lets you condemn the movement whole cloth without anyone being able to know whether you should.<br/><br/>It's sorta like saying: "So I heard some industry people say that Gareth Skarka is a terrible game publisher, and that he should just quit because his writing was so bad. I mean, they actually said that near some booth I was at!"<br/><br/>It's useless hearsay, not representational of anything at all at this point. All I can take away from it so far is, aw, Gareth felt bad. Which doesn't help anyone.<br/><br/>If what you say went down, people need to get their shit straight ... maybe. But, as you've presented it, we can neither condemn their comments, nor clarify, nor defend them. We don't know who said what, in what context, and why. <br/><br/>For example, I happen to agree that the so-called supplement treadmill is a pretty awful idea both as a economic descision and as a game design decision. No one's obliged to agree with me. I can point to specific reasons why I think that's so. Maybe that person on the bus can too. Who knows? We don't, not from this information so far.<br/><br/>I'm totally aware that this kind of thing has happened in the past. Jeff Dee experienced it without reason, for one, as I recall.

Now, I think many of us have moments when that sense of rebellion really surges in our gut, like when I look at the overwhelming sexism in mainstream roleplaying (something far less prevalent in indie games, in my experience) or when I see yet another d20 supplement selling the same stuff as 200 that have come before it or when I sign up for a mainstream game at a con and am bored to tears.  There are still differences that I think are significant, but those differences are becoming less and less over time (apparently there was a booth babe at the Forge booth this year, which is a bit baffling to me) and I think that trend will continue.<br/><br/>Thing is, there's a lot of mud flung all the time.  People are annoyed by indie games.  People are overwhelmed by the ubiquity and dirty aspects (sexism, racism, militarism) of mainstream play.  Mud is flying everywhere, with lots of people talking shit about lots of other people.  The key, I think, is not letting it get to you.  I have love for you and the work you do, as do many, many people here.  Don't take the negative opinions you hear as representative of the all indie game fans.  I certainly don't think the few dozen people who actively hate indie games are representative of mainstream roleplayers.<br/><br/>If we all try to be better than the mudslinging, I think we'll probably be fine.  It washes off, promise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90218">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GMSkarka" title="GMSkarka"><img alt="GMSkarka" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v385/GMSkarka/tinyadamant.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GMSkarka">GMSkarka</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90218/#Comment_90218" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-24T14:00:29+00:00" title="August 24, 2007  2:00PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 24, 2007 2:04PM by GMSkarka.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Naming names" and even, really, the specifics of what was said (the merits of supplements, for example), are secondary to the point that I'm trying to bring across -- namely, that there is an exclusionary vibe to the Indie movement, that most posters here have acknowledged to one extent or another.....and, human nature or not, I feel hurts not only the movement itself (insularity is never good for a vibrant form), and the wider field as a whole (dividing into "us" and "them", which can prevent both "sides" from learning from eachother).<br/><br/>I also see statements from Indie folks like "people are annoyed by Indie games" -- which speaks to a sort of "oppressed underdog" indentity, I suppose......but really, as someone on the "other side", I don't see the annoyance, or even negative comments about the games.   What I do see, and see a lot of, is a general dislike of the attitude which spurred this thread.

But, you insist that there is insularity and exclusion. I'm not saying that doesn't happen. I just think so far we aren't getting anywhere talking about it like this.<br/><br/>So, I'd like to ask what you think are actual problems and their possible solutions:\n<ul><li>What specific off-putting behaviors are widespread? What is this "attitude"?</li>\n<li>Why do you think the problem is with the indie scene and not with those annoyed? Can you demonstrate it's not, say, a symptom of embitterment in so-and-so rather than Publisher X is a fucking asshole punk?</li>\n<li>What, specifically, do you recommend to overcome this?</li>\n<li>Are you speaking only about fellow publishers from the traditional scene (non creator-owned publications?), or about all people? Non-Forge Booth people? Customers? Other hobbyists? Who's aggrieved here, and how could the scene be more open to them? Why do you think it should be more open to them?</li>\n<li>How do you define "indie", and why do you think it is a needless distinction? What would you prefer?</li></ul>\n(FYI, I define indie as creator ownership, that's it. I find this to be a especially useful distinction.

I'd hoped to spur some introspection without being put through the third degree, but since that's obviously not going to happen, on to your questions:<br/><br/>1) The attitude:   "Gamer than thou."     How many times have you heard this, or something like it?  "I get more value from a 150 page indie game than from a 300 page mainstream game."   The pervasive sense of <i>chic</i> that comes with the belief that somehow, because you've decided to use an odd format and don't offer your product through three-tier distribution, that it somehow makes it better or more "pure."<br/><br/>2) If you're actually seriously phrasing this question, I don't suppose there's any point in my actually answering it, since you'll write off any response as it being purely "my problem", rather than one endemic to the sub-culture.<br/><br/>3) I thought what I was recommending was clear -- an attitude check, both in self and others.<br/><br/>4) I'm talking specifically about the attitude of "Indie" designers towards the "Traditional" or "Mainstream" industry -- that we're somehow separate, and (again), that "indie" is somehow a badge of distinct value.<br/><br/>5) "Creator Ownership" as a distiction of "Indie" (which is often the fall-back definition) is meaningless, as most games in this industry ARE creator-owned...in most cases, the creator owns the publishing company.   For example, Shane Hensley created Deadlands and Savage Worlds, but you'd never hear Pinnacle referred to as "Indie" by the self-declared "Indie" movement.   The closer-to-actual-use definition of "Indie" which is communicated by behaviors (i.e., more pure in intent, more "cutting edge", more "artistic", more meaningful, better, etc.) has even less meaning, as you might imagine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90250">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90250/#Comment_90250" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-24T15:17:18+00:00" title="August 24, 2007  3:17PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gareth:  Serious, personal-level question here.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like games.

Those games are hitting my particular buttons better than their mainstream counterparts.  I read and play both, but I find myself drawn by personal taste to indie products more than otherwise.  I also personally get more enjoyment from pizza than from bratwurst.

Should I feel guilty that people in my community can be assholes?  Should I start to worry that, unbeknownst to me, I actually <i>am</i> insular and arrogant?  Should I increase my vigilance over my own actions, and start second-guessing my own motives?  Should I set forth to search out things that could be perceived as negative in my own back-yard and smite the posters?<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd like to respond to your damning portrayal of the community with both affirmation (of your discomfort and its solid foundation) and action (to try to alleviate the problems).

I'm just trying to show that people will abuse and misuse terms, and I think that's part of this problem you see.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90270">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anemone" title="Anemone"><img alt="Anemone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.tlucretius.net/temp/anemone_icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anemone">Anemone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90270/#Comment_90270" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-24T16:15:56+00:00" title="August 24, 2007  4:15PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh.

For example, Shane Hensley created Deadlands and Savage Worlds, but you'd never hear Pinnacle referred to as "Indie" by the self-declared "Indie" movement.   The closer-to-actual-use definition of "Indie" which is communicated by behaviors (i.e., more pure in intent, more "cutting edge", more "artistic", more meaningful, better, etc.) has even less meaning, as you might imagine.</blockquote>\nSo there is this funny thing that happens with games sometimes, over the course of their lives and publishing histories. Sometimes they fit some definitions of creator owned and not others, and other times they switch across the plate. <br><br>Like, Pinnacle, I don't currently count as Indie despite the fact that Shane created Deadlands and Savage Worlds because the majority of the books I've got from them (and I've got a few) were written by freelancers. So while Shane owns the games, at this point he hasn't written a big chunk of the stuff for the games. That was written by other creators, who (as far as I know) are not the owners of the material anymore. Shane, or some corporation formed by Shane, are. (GMS, if I'm wrong on that, let me know -- I'd like to be as close to facts as possible.) <br><br>Does that mean that once, when Shane was still writing the majority of the games (unless I misremember the first two or three Deadlands books were mostly his, or his and one partners) the games were Indie, but as Shane moved from writing (though he still does a good chunk of it) to managing other writers that it stopped being Indie? <br/><br/>And what, exactly, does the financial structure of Pinnacle look like on the inside? I have no clue if its still mostly Shane owning and distributing his own work, so I have no idea how much of that applies. I also don't know for sure (though I suspect) that Deadlands freelancers don't keep control over their own work. Though if they did, that'd be a different thing again. <br/><br/>But despite the vast numbers of things I don't know, you're right -- I still wouldn't have called Pinnacle "Indie." <br/><br/>To give two more examples, once upon a time HeroQuest was Indie. Greg owned it, it was enough his work (despite the large amount of work Robin did for it) that people who investigated and found out the actual economic arrangements made an informed judgment call that the game and the world were creator owned and distributed. Over time, with the move to the current publishing models, that changed enough and HeroQuest was no longer considered Indie because of combinations of the control and ownership that Greg gave up. <br/><br/>Once upon a time, Godlike was not Indie. It was owned by a corporation that was largely funded by investments from someone who was not creatively involved. Over time that arrangement changed, and Greg (different Greg) and Dennis got the rights and ownership of their material back. Then Godlike became Indie, as it was owned by the creators again. <br/><br/>So if nowdays I, who only know that Heroquest used to be a game that had a forum on the Forge, call Heroquest Indie, what am I saying? <br/><br/>Or what about Pelegrane Press? I've heard a thing or two about the way that they structure at least some of their game lines -- and it sounds like its creator owned for sure. Yet, I don't hear them called Indie very often. And again, I don't know the truth of the situation, and yet I tend to lump them outside of Indie in my own brain without knowing it. <br/><br/>And what about, say, Mob United Media? I know from talking with creators there the pains that Malcolm goes through to keep creator control and to treat his artists professionally and pay them as much as possible while still maintaining a business. I automatically think of them as being Indie, but the other day had someone try to correct me to say that they weren't. Because they didn't fit the school of design they associated with Indie. <br/><br/>So yea, Indie is a term with a lot of baggage. It's also a term that can be difficult to use clearly, especially by those of us who don't know the inner workings and corporate structures of the people working hard to make fun games for us. <br/><br/>But for all that, I don't find the term useless. I have real, personal, political issues with the need for creator ownership and control of work, and I very much think that an increase of that is a good thing for the hobby. I don't think the hobby has been horrible in this regard (with a handful of notable exceptions), but I'd like to see it get better -- see more Mob Uniteds and Adept Presses and such, where there is a strong ethic and strong stance on ownership, honesty, and direct contact with the customer. <br/><br/>So I think Indie can be a very useful term. I just think that the way that it gets used 53% of the time it's a problematic one.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90279/#Comment_90279" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-24T17:41:05+00:00" title="August 24, 2007  5:41PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 24, 2007 5:46PM by buzz.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Am I thinking of another forum, or did we have this same conversation on SG a few months ago?

Regarding Gareth, ostrcizing him from "Indie" is pretty damn weird in light of games like "Age of Empire" and "Periphery" which, while not the sole domain of one person, were games defining "Indie" several years before the Forge was (these were small-press games designed and published by a group of close-knit college chums in Lawrence, KS).

I thought about talking to him about why his game hadn't generated interest, but I wasn't sure what to say.

IPR is really its own brand, not some .org, so if they don't think something fits what they're looking for its well within their rights to say "thanks, but no thanks".  If you've got a problem with how IPR does business, then maybe you should take it up with Brennan and not indict people who aren't apart of IPR in any way.

Because that standpoint I can totally understand. This has less to do with nefarious plots of misinformation and subterfuge than it does with the way language naturally evolves (=perverts), of course.<br/><br/>It seems like the core issue lies with the definition of "indie games". I personally believe that this terminology is flawed, and plenty of other industry voices have been raised on this subject in the past. I remember one particular episode of 2d6 Feet where the feller from Green Ronin seemed pretty ticked over the misuse of the word "indie".<br/><br/>Gareth, assuming you agree on the above, do you think that some of the resentment from independent publishers that aren't necessarily making games based around Forge-ish models arise from things like the <a href="http://www.indiepressrevolution.com/xcart/help.php?section=about" rel="nofollow">IPR vision</a>? This "about" section of the site speaks specifically of "creator-owned games" and "independent publishers", not "story games" or "Forge-derived games", and if Brennan &amp; Co are excluding games based on them not qualifying as Forge-ish enough I can see the annoyance factor.<br/><br/>Mind, I'm not at all saying Brennan does this, but if that is your gripe he should probably address that question.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90328">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90328/#Comment_90328" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-24T22:47:58+00:00" title="August 24, 2007 10:47PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 24, 2007 11:21PM by Andy.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdrakeh</cite>For example, why a dude like Guy McLimore doesn't qualify as "Indie", I can't fathom -- but, apparently, he doesn't.</blockquote>\nWhat did he do?

Some are mainstream, many are indie. The games I like, I spend time talking about them and teaching people how to play them. I'm always happy to be associated with these games, and I love it when my games are mentioned alongside them. Games I don't like? I don't want anything to do with them. I don't want to be associated with them. I don't want to be near them. When somebody asks me if my games are like these games, or if I enjoy these games, I'm always quick to tell them no.<br>\n<br>\nSame goes for players. I recognize that everyone has different tastes. If someone can enjoy a game I don't like, I think that's great. I may still enjoy playing something else with them, but they won't get me to play that game. And I'll be happy to tell them what I don't like about it and why I don't like to play it. There's no reason that should offend them (unless I'm an asshole about it), but I find it very often does. And it creates a division. They're on one side, with a game I don't like. I'm on the other, with games I love. So be it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find this division to be greater with play styles then games. I'm often invited to sit in on local games around Portland. Very often these games turn out to be railroaded grind fests, and I don't return a second time. When asked why I always carefully explain my reasons. I don't like that style of play. I don't like being railroaded. I don't like not having any control over narrative, theme or world content. I don't like being bullied by a GM. The list goes on, although most games only hit two or three of these points.This almost always offends the GM and players. Who am I to tell them that the way they play is no good? That's not what I'm saying, but that's what they're hearing. They usually tell me that I'm too indie and I need to understand that most people don't like that stuff. They usually add in a bit about their favorite game being so much better then Panty Explosion (my game).  I counter that I don't care what they don't like. I'm only concerned about what I don't like. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don't want to be associated with these kinds of gamers. I don't want to waste my time with them. I'll give almost anyone a chance, but once they fail I walk away from them. I also don't want to be associated with the kind of games I don't like. I don't want to have anything to do with them. I don't want to waste my time with them and I don't want my own games to be compared to them. I'm happy to share my opinion with people, and I always try to explain why I do/don't want to play with a specific person, why I do/don't like a specific game or why I do/don't like a style of play. If any of these things make me an exclusionist or create a divide... well, I really don't care.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think there is a bit of a insider/outsider thing going on in our community. I think in some cases it's justified. It's never an excuse to be rude or to attack some one simply based on their tastes though. I think it's perfectly okay to say that you enjoy indie/story/whatever games. Even to say that you think these games are way, way better and more worthwhile then mainstream games. I think it's okay to identify yourself as an indie gamer or part of the indie community or an indie publisher. I think it's okay to assert the notion that the ideas (including content, themes, rules, theory, playstyles,etc) presented in indie games are superior to those of mainstream games. I think it's okay to say that I believe that some methods of publishing and distribution are better then others. I think it's okay to say that creator ownership is a hallmark of an indie game, but games that are owned by a "creator", but largely written and drawn by freelancers are not indie. I think it's okay to say that indie publishers are creating the most ground breaking and dynamic games currently available and turning roleplaying games into an emergent art form. I think it's okay to rally around the indie banner and support games and playstyles that I think are good. I think it's okay to try to share these views with other people. I think it's okay because I think all these things are true. If someone else has a different opinion, well good for them. They can say or do what they want. I don't care. If that creates a divide, I also don't care. I don't see any reason why the industry has to be a big happy family anyway. I'm not interested in excluding anyone who is interested in indie games, but I have interest in wasting my time on games I don't like and players that won't try anything new. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo be honest, I don't see this as exclusionist behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nJake                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90336">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SweeneyTodd" title="SweeneyTodd"><img alt="SweeneyTodd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SweeneyTodd">SweeneyTodd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90336/#Comment_90336" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-25T02:23:42+00:00" title="August 25, 2007  2:23AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            GMS, I hope this won't come off as uncivil, but I think it's worth considering the possibility that some people plain don't like you.

Demanding concrete evidence doesn't prove a point in and of itself - it's a defense posture.  What would the point of naming names be?  So the community could judge whether or not the people who said these things have the cred to be self-included into a category where some sort of defense is required, or so the names can be unrecognized and dismissed?<br/><br/>I'm sure if the person at GenCon who said these things read this board and recognized themselves, they might speak up.  They might not.<br/><br/>What if these things were said by (just to pull names way out of a hat), Luke Crane or Paul Czege, or anyone else with 'serious indie cred'?  Would that change the equation?  Or is the implication that anyone with 'serious indie cred' would never have said what Gareth is relating?<br/><br/>For what it's worth, I still see it and I still feel it.  I've simply come to recognize that there are lessons to be learned from this community, both socially and ludically.  I just have to walk a path that doesn't seek that approval, because it isn't going to happen and it's detrimental to what I want to get done to keep seeking it.<br/><br/>I suggest this to anyone who doesn't want the heartbreak, either.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90356">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kat%20Miller" title="Kat Miller"><img alt="Kat Miller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.enter.net/~whim/picks/ittykat.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kat%20Miller">Kat Miller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90356/#Comment_90356" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-25T07:17:13+00:00" title="August 25, 2007  7:17AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            GMS<br/><br/>Who is Indie and who feels Indie are two entirely different things.  The elusive "Indie Cred" and who has it and who doesn't has become a wart on the face of the movement. Its very easy for an individual to point to the whole group and say "you Forgies...you Indie people are__________."  Fill in the blank.  Mean? Exclusionary? Elitist?<br/><br/>What you were once told "on the Forge" and what a 3rd party said to you about what someone else said about you, and even over hearing what Rob D said at the Ennies  "Cool kids table...Big Kids table" are not a good basis for claiming that everyone who is a member of Story Games who identifies as an "Indie" needs to keep ourselves in check.  <br/><br/>Things change fast in this movement, look around.  This is NOT the Forge.  What was said to you years ago or even days ago at the Forge, doesn't apply here.<br/><br/>I don't know how much of what your 3rd party took stuff out of context.  <br/>Does the speaker know you at all? Know you well enough to have a grudge or even a jealousy over you?<br/><br/>Using stuff overheard by someone you obviously don't know and not bothering to talk to this person, but using a forum to complain to the invisible collective Forgites tells more about motive than it helps you make a case about Indies being exclusionary.<br/><br/>Your complaint comes down to one argument with one guy on a bus about "Supplement Treadmill" and his rude dismissal of you.  Which by your description it sounds like Bus Guy is trying to show off his "understanding."  This behavior is typical.  I've seen and lived through many who have an "understanding" of either the terms or essays and when I don't agree I've also gotten dismissed.  The difference is that I usually feel a little bad for the other guy...he's not quite there yet.  He's still trying hard to prove his understanding and in doing so prove to himself he is "Indie"<br/><br/>Lets face it, if he really understood the "Supplement Treadmill," he'd know why it didn't apply to you.  If he really felt secure in his own Indie status he wouldn't have been dismissive to you.  I have to assume Bus Guy feels about as "Indie" as you do.<br/><br/>Feeling Indie is a strange thing.  Pretty much in order to be part of the movement you need to like and support the games, that's it.   Being a Member of the Forge Booth, the IPR or specific forums does not make anyone more or less Indie than someone else. <br/><br/>"Indie enough" is a sad little joke on the one who uses the words.<br/><br/>Am I Indie enough?  <br/><br/>I'm the wife of a Forge booth alumni, I avoid the exhibit hall as much as possible.  I help organize scheduled Indie games at 4 conventions around the year.  I run mostly my husbands game as a promotion and because I love his game. With Great Power...is my favorite game to run right now.  <br/><br/>Many of my Gms aren't creator owners, they are fans running the games they love to help support their favorite creator owners.  Are they Indie enough?  <br/><br/>If you don't subscribe to any forum, but you've spent hundreds of dollars on games you never play but just love to read cause they are new and different are you Indie enough?<br/><br/>The next time you hear "Indie enough" hear the joke for what it is.  Like an exploding pen those words mark the user far more than anyone they are trying to mark.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90361">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GMSkarka" title="GMSkarka"><img alt="GMSkarka" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v385/GMSkarka/tinyadamant.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GMSkarka">GMSkarka</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90361/#Comment_90361" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-25T08:25:41+00:00" title="August 25, 2007  8:25AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 25, 2007 8:26AM by GMSkarka.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I find it interesting to note that in the same thread where people are bending over backwards to claim that it's obviously just my unique experience, or that it's a case of some fringe element who I'm somehow unfairly attributing to the rest of the movement.....<br/><br/>In the very same thread, we have comments where people say they <i>have</i> seen this, and it does exist.....and other comments (like jake richmond's), which embody the attitude itself.<br/><br/>Folks, I'm not saying we've got a barrel of bad apples.

That's a PR problem</blockquote>\nTrue, but it's also a personal problem in some cases.<br/><br/>Not too long ago (and I forget where: Was it here? RPGNet? TheRPGSite?) some indie designer/publisher was asking publicly, "Why do people who have questions about some indie games ask them in public places like RPGNet, and not on that game's forum?"  Sure enough, dig a little deeper and the question was rephrased to something like, "How come we have all these people constantly talking about Spirit of the Century (this game was specifically mentioned), asking rules questions and the like, on RPGNet, instead of on the Evil Hat forums or mailing list?" with the clear implication that it's some sort of organized fan-driven conspiracy to talk up the game in public places, and that people with questions should basically ask them only in the specific, appropriate place for that game.<br/><br/>Scratch the surface any further, and it's clear that the publisher was basically wondering why his own games were not being talked about in the same way, getting the same buzz. Turning his own poor performance into a damnation of enthusiastic fans. "It must be a plot". "The fans must be working together to deceptively create buzz". <br/><br/>We see these kinds of self-reflective teeth grinding all the time:<br/><br/>"Why aren't my games selling?"<br/>"Why isn't my blog getting hits?"<br/>"Why is my forum not hopping?"<br/>"How come no one is reviewing my design/game?"<br/><br/>"...it must be because of <i>them</i>!"<br/><br/>That's projection. It exists, even here. It's a personal problem.  I would admit that, sure, 3, 5, 7 years ago or whatever some forces were put in motion that caused things to perhaps appear that way if you were digging for it. Put on your archeologist's hat, say "I'm digging for cliques/deception/false enthusiasm/dickweeds", and sure enough you'll find it.  But when perceived behavior intersects with personal disappointments, who is "the community" to do anything about this?<br/><br/>Just a thought. And not a reverse-damnation or anything like that.  Shit, I project, too. We all do. It's a human social defense mechanism.  But when it pounds into the reality of the situation... judgements become difficult.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90365">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alan" title="Alan"><img alt="Alan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alan">Alan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90365/#Comment_90365" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-25T08:43:58+00:00" title="August 25, 2007  8:43AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            GMS,<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, elitism shows up in every group. <br/>\n<br/>\nI recall an event at one of the first science fiction conventions I attended. In the hospitality room, I happened to sit near a circle of people listening to one individual talk about how "the mundanes just don't get it!" I've seen this attitude among certain individual SF fans. I've seen it among certain individuals in any small group who find special identity in being part of a the group. They bolster their egos by being part of something "special."<br/>\n<br/>\nJust as certain members of larger, more commercially successful groups do. "I work for Amazon" or "-- Microsoft..." or "WOTC." <br/>\n<br/>\nI've also observed that--in both cases--such people have not made  any productive contribution to what makes that group valuable or unique.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne way to judge a group is to assess whether elitism is the core value or the fringe. If you check with the core of the small press RPG movement -- Ron, Matt, Mike, Clinton, Luke, Vincent, etc. etc. you'll find they don't support elitism. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I'm at an SF con and hear such talk, I find someone else to talk with.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I haven't encountered this sort of talk at GPNW or Dragonflight here in Seattle, if I did, I would just walk away.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's my advice to you, too. Go find one of the majority of the "indie" community who aren't elitist bozos.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90366">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90366/#Comment_90366" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-25T08:58:28+00:00" title="August 25, 2007  8:58AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 25, 2007 9:33AM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [Edit: cross-posted with previous two posts -- I didn't mean to be piling on!]<br/><br/>Gareth,<br/><br/>Your last post would make sense if this community we are speaking of in any way had a method of "getting everyone on the same page," or controlling brand management.<br/><br/>That isn't the case, and never will be.<br/><br/>We are not responsible to each other as a "movement" or a group or a whatever to put on a good face.  Certainly, if someone says something dumb some people might call him on it.  But there is no daily talking point email that goes out each morning.  It's never been that way, it won't be that way.  This expectations of PR massaging always strike me as... "What the heck are you talking about?  What PR?"<br/><br/>I'll go further.  We all know that the litmus test of what is going to offend one person is not the same point as what will offend someone else.<br/><br/>Rob, in his giddiness (and, as far as I can tell, self-deprecation if not insecurity) makes a crack about sitting at the grown up table.  In that comments it's clear Rob considers <i>himself</i> an outsider.  To the club.  Goofy, sad, or in need of Souther California-styled Self-Empowerment course, there's no need at all to assume that he meant it as a <i>slight</i> to anyone.  It's perfectly in line with the silliness of Sally Fields' "You do like me!" Oscar comment.<br/><br/>Final note:<br/><br/>There are a lot of apples and oranges floating around.  Rob's comment is goofy, spontaneous insecurity revealed.  Some guy quoting Ron at you and ignoring your own years of business experience is another, and Jake Richmond's "I Want to Have Fun" Manifesto is a third.  To lump them all together under the, "You guys really need to get on message" meme is, in my view, no only impractical but prickly.  <br/><br/>I agree with everything Jake said, and yet I know it will be translated into some thread soon -- here, ENworld, Pundit Land -- as proof that we're all assholes who shit on anyone with a hardback D&amp;D book.  That's not what Jake said, but some will perceive it that way.  And other people who never read the context or even the thread or the post will get the "impression" that we all assholes who shit on anyone with a D&amp;D hardback.<br/><br/>Am I supposed to whisper to Jake -- "Hey, dude, someone, somewhere will be offended by what you just wrote. We really don't want to come off like that."<br/><br/>Of course not.  First, there's no "We."  Second, we can't control people's perceptions.  And third, I'm sure neither Jake nor I want to live that way.<br/><br/>Yes, there are assholes and ignorant fools.  And they'll often spout one bit of nonsense or another.  That's what I was talking about in my first reply to you upthread.  But that doesn't mean I perceive it as institutional or common -- which seems to be your perception.  <br/><br/>But in spite of that, I need to make this clear: There's no PR operation in place, there won't be, there can't be.  For you to even frame things this way, as if there's this "indie" organization that is so well defined and monolithic only reveals your sense of tribalism, looking at a group of dispirit individuals as a unified "other."<br/><br/>CK<br/><br/>A final addendum: some of the people who might be offended by some "indie" guys comments <i>might be a regular on this site</i>.  I'm not surprised you are getting whispers. Again, it's not a monolithic institution.  Different people perceive slights for different things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90369">\n<div

Has been for quite some time.  But, see, Ron Edwards, Vincent Baker, Jason Morningstar, and Ben Lehman can all be legitimately called "Indie".  Brett Bernstein, Clash Bowley, and RPGPundit can be legitimately called "Indie", too.  Dan Bayn is Indie.  You're Indie.  So am I.<br/><br/>Indie is vague enough term to cover a lot more ground than "community X".  That many of the communities have had, or currently do have, some exclusionary members, ideals, or hangers-on (or all of the above, or none) is not the fault of "the independent gaming community"...  <br/><br/>...Because there isn't one well-knit group.  There are <i>several</i>, with people that transit between them, people trying to shape definitional nonsense, people that want to feel important, people that want to make others seem important, people that just don't give a damn, and so on.<br/><br/>There won't be unified action, because <b>there's no single, unified, independent group</b>.<br/><br/>There are, instead, a lot of independent individuals, plugged into greater or smaller communities.<br/><br/>I'm not telling you to get over it, exactly.

This alone would only moderately annoy me but on another thread the thoughts of Lehman when implying that Indie games are so dissimilar that you would have to actually play an N number of them to be able or entitled to understand some basic concepts and I was also disappointed by Shreyas' comment that he didn't have enough stimulus to, what I thought was, share his knowledge with interested players. My thread turned out very inflammatory since I didn't like the patronizing attitude of mr. Lehman and I threw a fit. I was called names after I had to call somebody else a moron. If anybody care to read, they will see that my behavior was reactive, 90% or more of the time. And, it felt like, just because I am not part of the clique that (except for a person called Nancy) my original question was not addressed. People seemed to hide behind one excuse: "this is so inflammatory that no one will answer the question". It was impressive that so many people turned out to throw stones and nobody (except for Nancy) came to address the question. <br/><br/>I feel this was greatly in part because of Lehman's initial blanket statement. which I felt was empty and unhelpful.<br/><br/>My original goal was to present and bring more players to Story Games and, at the same time, have fun. <br/><br/>After both threads, I was left with the impressions that making these games accessible to more players is not really welcome. I also had the impression that there is a degree of fear of the cool aspects of some games to get known. I don't know if it is fear that the idea could be stolen. Or, if more people know about it, it would not be as "cool". I am unable to find a positive spin to this sort of behavior.<br/><br/>As others said about GMS, maybe it is just all personal against me.

I think you're right that you, us, Evil Hat, and some others are sorta on the fringe of the "main indie movement", to the degree that there is such a thing. None of us really got our start from the Forge (unless i'm misremembering something), and none of us are really doing Narrativist-style RPGs, with the possible exception of DRYH (though, interestingly, i'd classify SotC, Zo, Dead Inside, T&amp;J, and Dread as all being Dramatist, according to the Threefold--and, specifically, i think they fall into that part of Dramatist that doesn't appear to be described by any of the GNS categories). And, yeah, i definitely get a vague feeling--not one that i can actually attribute to anyone ever actually saying, so i don't know if i'm detecting an unspoken undercurrent, or imputing beliefs where there are none--that "indie" as the term is generally used actually means "rules-lite, Narrativist, and without supplements", rather than "creator-owned". I don't ever really feel excluded, just not always included, if that distinction makes sense? <br/><br/>I find it really interesting that Luke has been completely embraced, as near as i can tell, despite Burning Wheel also coming from outside the Forge, and also not really being a Narrativist design. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>(apparently there was a booth babe at the Forge booth this year, which is a bit baffling to me) </blockquote>\nWell, given that Fae Noir, which the booth babe was shilling for, looks to me to be pretty much a traditional-style RPG, it's a tad less surprising to see traditional shilling techniques.<br/><br/>Oh, and i snipped the quote, but i'd say that, if you're gonna credit a single person with "inventing" the PDF RPG market, it would be Philip J. Reed.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Anemone</cite>These days, I'm interested in building bridges, not islands; I'm interested in finding common points between the various sub-genres of the hobby, not in splitting it into finer distinctions.

Because they didn't fit the school of design they associated with Indie.</blockquote>\nHere's the thing i've always found a bit bizarre about the "creator-owned" definition of indie, at least for RPGs: why is it the game text that is the defining characteristic? Why not, say, the art? Or both the text and the art? Why is it okay to buy art for your game book [and still qualify as indie], but if you buy words for your book, you're not indie? Sure, for a lot of RPGs, the art is secondary--it's basically decoration for the game text. But what about a game like the amnesia one i saw at the Ashcan Front, which had image-ful cards as an essential component of the game? Shouldn't those images need to be owned by the creator, rather than bought from an artist, for the game to qualify? [and i'm not saying they weren't--it's just an example.] Or, what about a game like Zero, which is a game built around a body of art. Surely, if the art is the genesis of the creative work, and the text derives from it, it is unreasonable to describde that game as creator-owned if the owner only created the text, not the images?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90425">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lxndr" title="Lxndr"><img alt="Lxndr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/803/nRIOJTW5OT0WE.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lxndr">Lxndr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90425/#Comment_90425" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-25T15:19:58+00:00" title="August 25, 2007  3:19PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: woodelf</cite>Here's the thing i've always found a bit bizarre about the "creator-owned" definition of indie, at least for RPGs: why is it the game text that is the defining characteristic?</blockquote>\nI can't answer for other people but for me:  because you don't sit around a table and play the art.

The art decorates the product, possibly even inspires it, but you playthe game.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow is the text any more a part of your game than the art? The text is a medium for transmitting the game--the game can exist without being written down. You don't play the game text, either. And what about when we're talking about art that is integral to the play of the game. IIRC, Primitive involves using sticks and stones as randomizers, right? They're clearly not part of the text, yet they're clearly part of the game. What if the game had a defined setting, and defined it solely through pictures, not words? What if you had a game that had a "divination deck" as its sole randomizer, a la the Tarot or Everway's Fortune Deck, but there were no words at all on the cards, just images? Would those images not be part of the game, just decoration?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's true that (1) we generally convey RPGs via words, and most often written words, and (2) in most RPGs the art is clearly secondary to the text, and is often, as you say, essentially just decoration. But i've seen an awful lot of diagrams in RPGs, and many of them were conveying information that wasn't presented in a textual manner, couldn't easily be presented in a textual manner, or both. It just seems silly to have a blanket exclusion of the importane of art for defining the ownership of games, when ownership is otherwise the defining characteristic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/blankshield" title="blankshield"><img alt="blankshield" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.blankshieldpress.com/jamesgoplay.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/blankshield">blankshield</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90432/#Comment_90432" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-25T15:40:25+00:00" title="August 25, 2007  3:40PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 25, 2007 3:41PM by blankshield.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't speak to definitions of indie, or to anyone else, but in my games, any art or text that I do not directly contribute is owned by the creator, and I pay for it's use.

It's not like other forms of media and entertainment haven't had this argument...<br/><br/>James                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90433">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90433/#Comment_90433" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-25T15:41:35+00:00" title="August 25, 2007  3:41PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GMSkarka</cite>Venti MochaIndie Latte?</blockquote>\nWith cinnamon, please.<br/><br/>I'd personally just say, "The core book is Indie.

The art sort of sits prettily on the page and maybe, sometimes, inspires some ideas about what to do in the story being created by the game. Without the text, the process is not communicated to me - the GAME. Without the art, some images might not be communicated to me, but the game will still be there. <br/><br/>Sure there might be games out there already, or even hypothetical games, where specific, provided-by-the-author-accept-no-other art is actually part of the play experience. (Everway comes close with its <i>Vision Cards</i>, but it explicitly says 'use art cards, we've just provided a selection' and I'm sure I'm not the only one who owns art cards far beyond what the game provides - I don't know of any published game that comes any closer than Everway as far as art as an actual part of the game). I could possibly point at some of those hypothetical (or extant-but-unknown-to-me) games and say "aha, that uses art enough in the game itself that it should at least be considered a collaboration." (After all, creator owned doesn't have to mean single credit) I really can't say without seeing the actual products in question.<br/><br/>As for randomizers: using sticks and stones is not any more, or less, "creator owned" than using cards, or dice, or a roulette wheel, or jenga - unless you're supposed to use the particular sticks and stones provided by the author and can accept no other. And, since I've seen primitive sold without these specific sticks and stones... maybe I don't know primitive well enough to say, but it doesn't appear to be the case.<br/><br/>Anyway, this is my, personal, rationale as to why the text is more the game than the art <i>ever could be</i> in most products - because without the art, the text can still tell you how to play. Without the text, the art can give you nothing except an inspiration on where to possibly base some freeform play. Again, if we go further perhaps a new thread might make sense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90439">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90439/#Comment_90439" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-25T17:23:40+00:00" title="August 25, 2007  5:23PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GMSkarka</cite>2) Rather than creating a "seperate but equal" d20 Indie booth, why not just make the effort to communicate more clearly that d20 Indie stuff is welcome and available at the Forge booth?

Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\nI disagree somewhat. It is quite clear there are problems with specific instances of interaction between different human beings. I don't doubt that GMSharaka had these experiences that were negative. I wonder if the other people also felt the interaction was negative, there's no way to know from the evidence we have been allowed. I also don't doubt you have read folks snubbing d20. I don't want to dismiss anyones experiences by falling into a, "just change your perception" argument. I think that's pushing towards Sophistry. It is true that you can change your way of dealing with and analyzing human behavior, and that may even be helpful in the cases presented, but to make a change your perception argument suggests there are no standards of acceptable and good behavior. If that seems like what I was saying then I did not express myself well.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I'm saying is what has been presented is far from being evidence of a systemic problem of the Indiepunk culture. It is evidence of some elitism obviously, but not of a nature that I think we should be spending this much time on it. My argument is there is not enough evidence to show this is an at large problem. There certainly was some sort of specific problem between individuals.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich means in the end argument I agree with you, Levi. The perception is false on the level it's being addressed at in this thread, the level of the community as a whole. My many experiences, and it sounds like yours also, have been that the indiepunk scene has been very open and supportive, and that is just as valid a perception as the few individuals who have presented a different perception.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90459/#Comment_90459" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-25T20:13:57+00:00" title="August 25, 2007  8:13PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Clyde L.

Hmm.  I'm not sure I should really be commenting here.  This will be my first post on Story Games, and this may be a bad place to get started.  But I'm having trouble resisting, so what the hell.  I'm going to throw out a few thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo start with, it may be worth noting that I'm quite new to the "indie games" thing, having only become aware of the Forge, and the kinds of games discussed there and here and sold on IPR and elsewhere about a year ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut here's a strange thing, while I had no real reason to believe it would be this way, a year ago I felt like the "indie games community" (to whatever extent such a thing exists) *should* be clique-y.  Or rather, I had the expectation that it would be.  I'm not really sure why.  This probably says much more about me than it does about "the community."  Of course, my first exposure to the Forge was when Greg Stolze suggested I check out some of Ron Edwards's articles there.  Those articles are full of theory and big ideas, and aren't really warm and welcoming (not that I'm trying to say they OUGHT to be, mind you).  Through slow, small experiences since that point I've found that people in the "indie games community" generally seem to be pretty cool.  At least everyone I've interacted with directly (whether face to face at gen con this year, or through email or whatever) has been.  But I didn't expect them to be... and I'm still scared to post on the Forge.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne problem might be the term "indie" in and of itself.  Someone earlier in this thread (forgive me for not quoting it directly) suggested that some designers/authors might  (on some level) not want their game to be popular because then it might be less cool, or something along those lines.  Isn't it rather like this with "indie" music?  I have often heard people complaining about how such and such a band was so much better before they "sold out" (read, started making money) and it's always seemed to me that what the fans are really upset about is that they're no longer "special."  It's no longer a situation where they know this nifty, cool band that no one else has ever heard of and they can feel unique because of that.  That kind of mindset seems fairly common among almost any group that can (legitimately or not) think of themselves as "indie" or fans of some kind of "indie" thing.  It's almost that it's cool to be uncool, or something.  So if that mentality is prevalent here, that might be a problem... for not only the reasons I just said, but also because those on "the outside" might think, "They call themselves 'indie' so they must be pretentious pricks that don't even actually WANT other people to be able to enjoy and understand their games, because then those games wouldn't be 'indie' anymore."<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I think there's another similarity with music.  What makes music "indie?"  For most people it seems to have far less to do with anything actually being independent and more to do with what it "feels" like.  I think the same may go for games (at least the way *most* people seem to use the term).  For example, Greg Stolze's newest game, REIGN (which I own and think is great, by the way, so I'm not intending to disparage it here) does not "feel" "indie" to me.  It's a big shiny hardcover, for one thing, which will look right at home next to my White Wolf books.  It also has a structure that seems more "traditional" and has a fairly traditional task resolution system.  But in reality it's hard to get more independent than Greg's recent works.  I don't know of any examples on the other side (a rules-light, narrativist game with a tight focus published by, say WoTC?) but maybe you know what I mean.  To me, it doesn't usually sound like "indie" has as much to do with creator-ownership OR "who you run with" but more with how a game "feels."  In the end, its kind of like that famous line (said by a judge about pornography, I believe?) "I can't define it, but I'll know it when I see it."<br/>\n<br/>\nHm.  I'm not totally sure if I had a huge point here, so maybe this was a waste of everyone's time.  But I felt compelled to respond.  The thing is, there probably are people (mostly fans and not designers/authors, I'd imagine) who probably are elitist and would prefer to see "indie" games stay small and relatively unknown so that it can be the ultra-cool, hip, secret little hobby that no one else knows about or even understands.  The tragically misunderstood minority without the misunderstood minority that all gamers already belong to, possibly.  But I think I get the main message GMS was going for?  At least when I first read it, I didn't see it being an admonishment of the "community" as a whole or some kind of call for massive action... I just saw it as wanting to nudge people into asking themselves "Do I behave like an elitist, exclusionist jerk, and if so, is that really how I want to act?"<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, sorry for the kind of rambling, possibly pointless post.

That perception is the learned response that society has developed to all things that have the audacity to label themselves as 'indie'.<br/>\n<br/>\n- 'indie' music that eschews the popularist beats and styles of chart music and instead embraces guitars and 'meaningful' lyrics<br/>\n- 'indie' comics that deny four-colour spandex heroes in exchange for deep analysis of the life of the teenager goat-herder. In monotone.<br/>\n- 'indie' wrestling where fireworks and soap-opera storylines are tagged out for stiff bouts, spot monkeys and 'proper' wrasslin. In school gyms<br/>\n<br/>\nEach of these creations have said ' we see the mainstream product and we want something different. We see the apparent barriers between us and success and we can overcome them. Rather than being consumers of a hobby, we are becoming participants of a hobby. And then producers of the hobby.'<br/>\n<br/>\nThats a very empowering statement but for many people who buy into the mainstream version of that product, it comes with some different assumptions. It says that there is something 'wrong' with the mainstream product. And when you have invested emotional and real capital into something, you don't want to be told that you are wrong. It says that you, the fan, are elevating yourself to a different level, moving up a perceived ladder. But it also says that you will not be part of that mainstream and somehow know how to be part of the machine but not be the machine. You clever bastard! Its very easy to generate some very negative elitist vibes from a pretty standard indie statement of intent.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I have also seen in other 'indie' sectors is a degree of zealotry from the fans of these new products. They have made a decision to seperate themselves from the mainstream but they have become participants in a far smaller section that runs under some very vulnerable basics. So everyone else's music simply isn't cool enough and they are 'sheep' to the record companies. Everyone's comics are purile and not exploring the artform. Everyone's wrestling is neutered and facile and soap-opera. If you aren't 'indie' then you aren't getting the true way that things can be. And you are therefore a zombie sheep of the corps.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd what makes this even worse is that the learned knowledge is that 'indie' creators will tend towards the mainstream in a search for commercial success. The bands will 'sell out' and get a record label and end up on MTV. The comic writers and artists will get picked up by DC/Marvel and end up working on titles that have been around for 50 years with characters that appear on lunchboxes. The wrestlers will eventually make the leap and work for Vince, usually with the truncated WWE style and never fly again. Sure, there are the Enter Shikari, Dave Sim and A J Styles of this world, but they are few and far between.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you apply these lessons to 'indie' games what can we see?<br/>\n<br/>\nDo we have people who have said that they have viewed the mainstream product but want something similar, but different? Oh yes.<br/>\nDo we have people who have lifted the curtain on the means of production and said 'Actually, I can do that!'? Oh yes.<br/>\nDo we have people who have moved from 'fan' to 'creator' to 'producer'? Oh yes.<br/>\nDo we have instances of 'indie game fan zealotry'? Oh God yes!*<br/>\nDo we have instances of language, understanding and preference being used to make value judgements on people? Oh yes.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's pretty much standard for all things labelled 'indie'.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe trick, of course, is that from the inside-looking-out, the vast majority of us would know that many of the assumptions and presumptions are incorrect, exaggerations and downright fabrications. However, we cannot deny those that there are people that have these opinions. Just because opinions may be incorrect doesn't mean that they do not exist!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only way to overcome the misconceptions, I would suggest, is to be as inclusive and open as possible. I remember when I used to work with a small CCG company. They had one ground rule - you NEVER EVER EVER slag off the competition, ESPECIALLY Magic. Why? Because it looked small and petty and vindictive. The phrase was 'Different not Better' - difference is quantifiable, better is a matter of personal taste.<br/>\n<br/>\nAh well, thats my tuppence, for what it's worth<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil<br/>\n<br/>\n* I was that fanboy, at the ENnie awards, everytime the M&amp;M; Ultimate Powers book got an award or a nomination over an indie game. Spitting bullets. We actually went and looked at it the next day to see what all the fuss was about?

It does not change the fact that the perception of something cannot be changed by going to a board, and if it was your desire to stop the spreading of a perception, then why not attack the source of the perception?  Its not the people here who are scratching their heads that need the talking to, it is the people who may continue to make other people feel the way you feel that do.  I never said that this was a perception was limited to you, but I have asked (three times now) why you feel you can confront the group-think, while not confronting the people who made you feel a certain way?  I will reiterate that I believe every word you said, and I agree that there is a perception that exists, but don't pretend that your attitude (in that initial post) was anything more than your own brand of enlightened snark.  Its fine if you guys want to continue to expand the Passport and debate why Fred needs to build bridges, if there is no divide, but I think you should stop ignoring the opportunity to deal with these problems on a face to face level and deal with people instead of the idea of what represents exclusivity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GMSkarka" title="GMSkarka"><img alt="GMSkarka" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v385/GMSkarka/tinyadamant.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GMSkarka">GMSkarka</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90494/#Comment_90494" name="Item_89" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-26T11:03:44+00:00" title="August 26, 2007 11:03AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tyler, you keep missing my point.

If you want people to ask themselves if they're exclusionary then maybe you should ask that, instead of doing the finger wagging that I saw in that post.  I still believe the power of face to face contact holds a good deal of power and you had the opportunity to ask the people who are obviously feeding the perception to reflect on their behavior and what it means to the community they identify with.  I ABSOLUTELY believe that helps better solve the problem than what you actually did.  I agree with you that a perception exists, and it doesn't take much for the perception to persist, and if you say that was your intent by posting to bring it to folks attention, okay, but that's what I read in your posts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90500/#Comment_90500" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-26T12:39:29+00:00" title="August 26, 2007 12:39PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 26, 2007 12:49PM by Graham.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Look, come on.

What "indie" means to me is small-press games that you (typically) don't find in the FLGS--and these games most often offer an idiosyncratic ruleset tailored toward a specific premise, as opposed to generic, one-size-fits-all, "universal" mechanics.  That's my definition.  YMMV.<br><br>Here's the crux of the thread for me:  Gareth spoke to being dismissed based on an identification with "the industry" and purported "insider" status.  He pointed to the insularity and made that clear right up front.  So I found it interesting (and unhelpful) to see a number of dismissals here, anything from "what you say isn't valid unless you name names" to "get over it."<br><br>Most of the negative reaction to Gareth seems have been spurred by a tone in his original post that appeared to lump all indie gamers into the dickweed category.  It took awhile to get past that.  Maybe more questions up front would have helped clarify his intent earlier without the static, but the discussion has gotten all buttery smooth on this page (except for the last comment by Tyler), so it's all good.  I appreciate Gareth bringing it up and sticking with the discussion despite some of what I read as defensive trolling.<br><br>I think we ought to take in the excellent points about not generalizing and indie tribalism that have been made, then call bullshit on exclusionary comments when and where we hear them.  The cooperative bridge-building suggestions sound great.  In any heterdox community like this, it's about raising awareness and being more intentional about promoting agreed-upon community values.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90504">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tyler" title="Tyler"><img alt="Tyler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tyler">Tyler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90504/#Comment_90504" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-26T13:19:37+00:00" title="August 26, 2007  1:19PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Look, come on.

(Namely, why people interested in d20 might never come to the Forge booth, and vice versa)    Why does that perception have to exist?</blockquote>\nI think partly, they ARE different audiences. Why else would there be separate links on online retailer sites for "D20 Games" and "Roleplaying products."  I think we should take this example from successful retailers and also provide this functionality in the dealer's hall, somehow. Multiple booths was the first idea I had. It might not be the best.<br><br>Yes, there is an overlap between the two audiences, but there are also staunchly D20-only people who would never want to crack open and learn the rules of another system, just like there are staunchly... um, "indie?" people who would rather learn a new system than pick up another D20 product. And for that overlap that are willing to look at both, they can then go to both booths. In fact, just given the sizes of the audiences, there are probably more staunchly D20-only people than there are staunchly "indie?" folk. Again, I acknowledge that both groups are just a percentage of all the fans of said products, either "D20" or "um, indie?"<br><br>Why does this perception exist? In my mind it's because, as far as fans go, it is there. And it is mostly, in my experience at least, on the side of the D20 gamers who don't want to try other games, since they've already put forth the effort to learn ONE system (and therefore won't go to a booth that they see as an "other games" booth). It is not so much on the side of people who play games other than D20 ("indie" or otherwise). Perhaps this is just a large population out here where I live (in terms of my personal experiences), but it is a population that apparently exists enough for online retailers to separate "D20 products" into a category distinct from "Roleplaying Games." (Again, indie or otherwise) <br><br>This is one of the most successful bits of marketing on the part of the OGL, actually, and I applaud WotC/Hasbro/whoever for doing it. By opening up their system they've created a market of people who won't play a game until "the D20 version" comes out. These people are likely to avoid a booth that seems to have "not D20 products" and the Forge Booth is a booth that avidly markets all of the systems on its shelves (which is a good thing).<br><br>So, a separate booth for D20 indie products was the first thing I thought of. Perhaps there is some alternative sort of way that I'm not thinking of, to connect these two groups (i.e. the ones who want only D20 products, and the indie publishers selling D20 products at a booth that's not likely to attract people interested in only D20 products, due to the sheer positive chatter about non-D20 systems and lack of prominently displayed "D20" logos). The idea behind my post was to get the people interested in ONLY-D20 products and connect them to the D20 products available at places like the Forge Booth (or other collectives). Ideas that don't involve a separate booth would be great.<br><br>But why is there a division? The OGL/D20TL combination encouraged one, and has successfully created enough of one that the phenomena I'm seeing are occurring, and by not considering these divisions and this market, we might be doing the D20 publishers amongst us a disservice. And if a separate booth is not the best idea, and it's probably not, let us find better ones.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90511">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90511/#Comment_90511" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-26T14:23:43+00:00" title="August 26, 2007  2:23PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Lxndr</cite><br>But why is there a division?

Given what happens when it's brought up, though, I really don't see it going away any time soon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90522/#Comment_90522" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-26T16:05:48+00:00" title="August 26, 2007  4:05PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi, GMSkarka,<br/><br/>Look, man, I don't know you from Adam, but you seem pretty sincere. So I'm not going to say that you're trolling, or try to smear your high horse with RPG.net butter (or whatever that was... I'll admit, the last few posts are a little jumbled for me).<br/><br/>But, you know... You posted a declarative sentence on the Internet. Naturally, some will evaluate it and agree. Others will evaluate it and disagree. And some will immediately post on their LiveJournals about that obstreperous knob-goblin GMSkarka, who is actually foolish enough to believe [insert contention here].<br/><br/>You can't take it personally. And you can't worry about whether someone thinks you're not indie enough. Hell, I have yet to see a consensus on what 'indie' even means. On this thread, we've already seen differing points of view on the subject.<br/><br/>As you pointed out, we're not exactly Hollywood. If my game is a financial success, I'm not going to be putting spinning rims on my Lexus. I'm probably going to complete my collection of Stargate SG-1 action figures. Because a financial success in this business, if you ain't one of the big guys, can be measured in dozens of dollars. Am I right? With a few exceptions (can't think of any right now, but I'm sure there's a few), whether you're an indie designer or mainstream, you're not exactly lighting your Cubans with rolled-up hundred dollar bills.<br/><br/>This thread proves (to me, at least) that there's just no such thing as a collective point of view for the indie scene. Everyone's got their own perspective. I think d20 is just fine. That guy over there thinks that it blows donkey dong. Then again, his game's about squirrels, and it features a conflict-resolution system based on sunflower seeds. So, by bringing this up, you've given some people food for thought. And you've given others some LiveJournal ammunition. And there's probably someone who is actually working on a seed-based squirrel game, and I've just made an enemy for life.<br/><br/>But you shouldn't get bent out of shape about the standard message-board process (which is what this is). Hell, you didn't even get flamed. I've seen other boards where they'd call you a squirrel-molester just for having a vaguely-patriotic whatever-that-is as your icon.<br/><br/>Your point is an interesting one, and I think it bears consideration. Not everyone's going to agree that it's a real problem, and even those who agree with you aren't going to be able (or inclined) to remedy the issue today.<br/><br/>It's cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4036/we-dont-want-yer-kind-round-here" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4036/we-dont-want-yer-kind-round-here" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4036/we-dont-want-yer-kind-round-here/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4036/we-dont-want-yer-kind-round-here/p3" rel="next">3</a><a class=" p-4" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4036/we-dont-want-yer-kind-round-here/p4">4</a><a class=" p-5 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4036/we-dont-want-yer-kind-round-here/p5">5</a><a class="Next" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4036/we-dont-want-yer-kind-round-here/p3" rel="next">\xbb</a></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F4036%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F4036%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>"We Don't Want Yer Kind 'Round Here...." - Page 3 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4036/we-dont-want-yer-kind-round-here/p3" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="&quot;We Don't Want Yer Kind 'Round Here....&quot; - Page 3" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4036/we-dont-want-yer-kind-round-here/p3" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Hey, Gareth, next time you're at a con when there are a bunch of indie folk there, shake some hands and play some games.

I've been TOLD I don't fit, because I don't find things like Burning Wheel "innovative", or Breaking the Ice as providing what I want from an RPG. Does that make them bad games? Of course not. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is one of the reasons I've always felt excluded by "Indie", despite seeking Forge help on my games at one point. If you can't get one of the "big names" at the Forge interested you're not going to get the level of feedback, criticism, and support in getting a product to finished end-run quality. If you aren't writing games that try and do something completely different than things before it--you get excluded. (I'm not the only one either.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI like games that produce stories, love em (as I define stories),yet I  despise railroading. I like giving CHARACTERS tools to shape the game--empowered by the pilot (the player) behind them. I don't want to give the PLAYER's tools that aren't manipulated through their character in some ways--hence why I'm not a big Fan of many "Forge" style story games.  I'm more concerned with the goals, focus, and interests, of the fictional persona they wish to explore.<br/>\n<br/>\n I don't fit. Not quite with D&amp;D (i.e normal)  gamers. Not quite with Forge derived Indie.  I love gamers, I love gaming with gamers OF all stripes, as long as their choices of games and mine, can somewhat mesh I'll play with them.<br/>\n<br/>\n I respect gamers who play differently than me. Even if it isn't what I want, I can see the merits of different games for different people.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've seen a lot of elitism  from Forge Indie gamers, and I don't care for it. My suspicion to 'why" that is boils down to a need to try and make being different and outside the mainstream culture of gamers--as being a "good" thing, a "superior" thing, so one doesn't feel like they're a freak for not liking D&amp;D/dungeoncrawl style gaming.  I don't think my gaming is better than anyone else's other than that it is the type of gaming most suitable for me (and most often by extension, my players. )<br/>\n<br/>\nI know gamers of all types.  I write games of different types because of that. Maybe I'll never be a big thing. *shrugs* I do know I'll be happy doing my own thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90533">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90533/#Comment_90533" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-26T17:34:05+00:00" title="August 26, 2007  5:34PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: fnord3125</cite>wow, okay, this is totally off topic, but i'd definitely buy the seed-based squirrel game.  not sure if i'd actually *play* such a thing (though i'm willing to give almost anything a shot once) but damn, anyone who can come up with a workable game using sunflower seeds as the basis of conflict resolution has got some cool, weird craziness going on in his or her head and i'd love to read that book.</blockquote>\n<img alt="image" src="http://www.dread-rpg.com/squirrel.jpg"/><br/><br/>I am ashamed...<br/><br/>To keep this post from being completely worthless, let me hasten to agree with Joshua.

I don't think my gaming is better than anyone else's other than that it is the type of gaming most suitable for me (and most often by extension, my players. )<br/></blockquote>\nI've suspected this same thing before... and I find it odd and somewhat amusing.  Gamers of all kinds are already outside the mainstream.  In the fall semester of last year, I did a couple papers in my expository writing class that dealt with gaming.  Except for the two geeks in the class who were also gamers, no one else had ANY idea what I was talking about when I mentioned roleplaying games.  None.  After reading my paper, rather than discussing grammar problems and other technical issues with the paper or where I was unclear or ways to improve the paper in general, I probably spent a good 15 minutes or so trying to answer questions about what roleplaying games ARE (aided by the other two aforementioned gamers) and more or less failing.  One of the girls in that class is a pretty good friend of mine now and she's since told me that when I first mentioned it she thought I was talking about sexual roleplaying.<br/><br/>I'm kind of rambling.  Anyway, the point is, being that gamers are a group that are pretty widely misunderstood by most other people out there, it's kind of strange that anyone would seek to intentionally segregate themselves even further within that group.  I mean, for my part, while I'm new to the "indie" stuff, I don't like d20 or D&amp;D either.  But I get it.  I know why people like it.  Similarly I think I get why people like wargaming (something I also don't have much taste for) and I get why people also enjoy Dogs in the Vineyard or My Life with Master.  To me, all games are cool in their own way for their own thing.  This is why I've seriously never understood the derision and venom that I sometimes see coming from various people within the hobby gaming community.  Over on BoardGameGeek it's pretty common to see those who self-identify as eurogame players insulting (as one example) most of the card games put out by Steve Jackson Games, and anyone who likes to play them as well.  I recently poked around a little on TheRPGSite (and in particular read some reviews by TheRPGPundit) and saw people spewing quite a bit of venom targeted at "indie" games and those that play them.  Of course, I've also seen similar things going the other way, people on The Forge or wherever railing against d20 and D&amp;D.<br/><br/>And it all honestly confuses me.  I don't understand it.  Do some people *enjoy* hating certain things and people and trying to convince others of their inferiority?  Is that fun?  Games are supposed to be fun, right?  Myself, I like playing them, and I like talking about them.  If I don't like a game, I just don't play it and don't talk about it.  Cuz that's not fun for me.  There doesn't seem to be a good reason to go out of my way to try to convince other people that they're wrong for enjoying something.  Maybe I'll try to convince them that *other* things might be enjoyable too, but hell, if someone just *loves* D&amp;D, well more power to them.  I probably won't play, but I don't care if they do.<br/><br/>I think I've gotten a little off topic, so I'll stop now.<br/><br/>And Rafael, thanks.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  Are you going to write that book now?

Live Theatre (another tiny piece of the entertainment field) has the same thing going on.  Broadway houses ignore regional theaters (except when they need a new straight play to maintain a bit of artistic credibility.  The regional theatres sometimes pretend to be "just like Broadway" but in your home town and at other times scoff at the commercialism of NY Theatre and how much better they are for being "cutting edge".  And the community and independent artists tell everyone who will listen that they are the only real artists because they stayed true to their vision.   (You can tell they were true to their vision, because real vision is never profitable, so to be a real artist, you must starve.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is sad in the theatre world (and I would guess in the gaming world) is that the industry **needs** the whole ecosystem to thrive.  While it is human (and group) nature to find people like you and distance yourself from everyone else, we just can't survive that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot exactly sure what to do about it on the individual level, but it's an interesting problem to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90541">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90541/#Comment_90541" name="Item_108" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-26T18:57:45+00:00" title="August 26, 2007  6:57PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maureen, the situation is also pretty similar in comics, where you have indie comics (which sometimes means creative ownership and sometimes means punk rock rebellion or autobiographical emo content) and then you have superheroes.  <br/><br/>And lots of the indie folks HATE superheroes, never want to read a superhero comic every again, can't understand why most of comics is full of superheroes, because superheroes are LAME.

Most of them are shoving their heads in the sand or taking a few minutes out of their day to call Gareth a troll. Neither of those things with should be easily confused with "good faith discussion" yet, for some reason, people seem to be doing just that. Only Gareth knows his own motives despite the fact that many of the people on this thread seem to be pleased as punch to ascribe a conspiratorial agenda to him. I <i>can</i> say that he pretty much cuts through the bullshit and calls it like it is. There <i>is</i> a HUGE amount of denial going on here. Most of this thread is apologetic justification for the phenomena that Gareth laid out in the initial post. It isn't <i>discussion</i>. Let alone dicussion had in good faith. <br/><br/>Discussion concedes a willingness to accept the possibility that the other party has a valid point. Now, I think that there are some valid points on both sides of the issue. As Andy said elsewhere, however, I also think that there is a stunning amount of <i>total bullshit</i> on both sides of the issue, as well. Some rather well-known publishers reached this conclusion a while ago as they watched their bottom line go right down the drain when affiliation with certain communities went from being a business-building boon to being a giant fucking anchor around their neck. The issue that Gareth notes is pereceived as being an issue amongst enough consumers and designers alike, that I'm going to go out on a limb and say <i>it is</i>. <br/><br/>Now, here's the deal. . .<br/><br/>Threads like this won't FIX anything. They may draw attention to a potential problem, sure. That's good. In order for any change to actually take place, however, people need to stop posting about shit and <i>do something to change it</i>. Much like innovations in game design don't become innovations because some dudes on a message board talk about them. They become innovations because somebody gets off their ass and implements them in an actual game. And that's what needs to happen here. For all of those folks who see a problem, instead of spending time telling everybody else about it, <i>be the change you want to see</i>. <br/><br/><i>Run your games at the FLGS</i>. Don't promote them as high art. Don't tell people that they won't like it if they enjoy certain other games. GIVE THEM A CHANCE, GODDAMIT (they might love it)! Don't tell people who don't think like you do that they "don't get it" -- be willing to accept that MAYBE (just maybe) they have a good idea or perspective that you hadn't considered. Burn out the insulation. Make a personal, willing, effort to be as accessible, open-minded, and honest as you can be. Drop pretensions whenever you can. Having an attitude is <i>OKAY</i> -- just make sure that when you say something about the insular nature of the hobby that it comes from a place of concern, not bitter resentment. Etc, etc, etc. <br/><br/>Hey, it may not change the world. But it's a start. And if more people commit to breaking down barriers instead of building them, it <i>may</i> just change the hobby.

I'm pointing at your assumption that there is denial and apologetic justification.  All that denial and apologetic justification, though, is coming from people who have not had these horrible experiences.  To claim that these folks are in denial or forcibly doing some justification is basically denying their experiences. (sorry, if that was not the case, and you were making a different point, then yeah I jumped on the wrong point and I apologize if that's what happened).<br/><br/>Look at "fnord3125" 's experience above, followed immediately by Ronaldo's. Totally different experiences.<br/>Some people are looking at these two posts, thinking "X is totally delusional."<br/><br/>Is Brian (fnord) experience true? In that case, then GMS and folks who see the same behavior are self-delusional, willing to attribute their own failings to an outside group.<br/>Is Ronaldo's experience true? In that case, then a lot of folks on this thread are sticking their heads in the sand, denying the hurt caused by the community, perhaps which they themselves perpetrate.<br/><br/>I am totally unsatisfied with either conclusion above. With the conclusion above, we've locked into a pattern of "Well, which is it?"  <br/><br/>So which is correct?<br/>Is Brian correct, and Ronaldo delusional?<br/>Is Ronaldo, correct, and Brian delusional?<br/>Are both simultaneously right?<br/>Are neither right?<br/><br/>My answer? Whatever. Not an interesting question, and I'm not willing to come down on either side. I'll leave that to the critics. <br/><br/>Observations about what people see are totally fine, as long as all are invited to share and we don't do a lot of locking down.<br/><br/>Quick aside: This site was started to be about doing things in roleplaying. I didn't want it to be The New Theory Grounds, where we talk about behavior in a way that gets away from dice hitting the table. This discussion, by virtue of a lot of observations and no ideas for solutions, directions or Something To Do, is really going in that direction.<br/><br/>Back to the topic: What is an interesting question to me, and one I totally don't mind seeing people follow through on (as long as folks on all sides can keep their pointy fingers in their pants, myself included), is "OK, given GMS is correct... what can we do?" If you find yourself nodding in agreement with Gareth, James, Tim, Ronaldo etc, then it's time to start thinking of practical solutions. If we move on to the solutions-talk, then the other side's chatter on "but that's <i>just how people work</i>", "<i>all communities</i> have this" etc have no place in that discussion (and in fact would be trolling).<br/><br/>In other words, James asked the Interesting Question, and has begun thinking of practical solutions, with this:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdrakeh</cite><br/><i>Run your games at the FLGS</i>. Don't promote them as high art. Don't tell people that they won't like it if they enjoy certain other games. GIVE THEM A CHANCE, GODDAMIT (they might love it)! Don't tell people who don't think like you do that they "don't get it" -- be willing to accept that MAYBE (just maybe) they have a good idea or perspective that you hadn't considered. Burn out the insulation. Make a personal, willing, effort to be as accessible, open-minded, and honest as you can be. Drop pretensions whenever you can. Having an attitude is<i>OKAY</i>-- just make sure that when you say something about the insular nature of the hobby that it comes from a place of concern, not bitter resentment.</blockquote>\nAgreed. And thanks for that, too. I found this thread really unsatisfying in this latter part, without being able to put my finger quite on why: It lacked action. <br/><br/>So, let's make that assumption that Gareth is correct. There's a problem, and it's a problem that people should be able to do something about. What are things that people can actually do, given the problem GMS proposes?<br/><br/>I want to hear more on this.<br/><br/>And from this line on:<br/><br/>=======================================================================================================<br/><br/>...I don't want to hear any more casual behavior observances in this thread. Save it for your blogs. Or next year's eventual thread on a similar topic.<br/><br/><b>You can post your observations if they are immediately followed with an idea for a practical solution.</b><br/><br/>Or, heck I'll lower the bar and say that you can post your observation if you can ask a good question which prompts people to think about solutions.<br/><br/>No more chatter.

If a lie is spoken, then that's shaky ("Fuck up the discussion by calling them out in public? Do it in private? Is it worth, in this situation, the destruction to be Right rather than to be Empathetic?*"), but I'd still encourage people to do it in a way that doesn't come off as aggressive or belittling.<br/><br/>On that item, in terms of these discussions, discussions on the community or the like where there are turns taken that make you feel uncomfortable: Listen to what people say. Do not read too much into what is typed on a message board (give a lot of leeway for possible miscommunication). Assume that you heard the other person wrong or misinterpreted before jumping to attack. If you treat someone nice, and they in turn treat you like shit, then that's their problem: It is not an excuse to jump to the offensive with the next person you speak to.

I'm certain that some people have good experiences. I was referring to the replies that swing from authoritative statements of 'There is no problem' to 'You're a goddamn troll!' or 'It's all in your mind' to 'Get over it' in the space of a single post. I don't think that any impartial reader viewing this thread could honestly say that there is a discernable lack of such posts. That said, when discussing something that I'm passionate about, I am often given to hyperbole. That's just part of who I am. \n<blockquote>This discussion, by virtue of a lot of observations and no ideas for solutions, directions or Something To Do, is really going in that direction.</blockquote>\nAnd, in my (admittedly anecdotal) experience, this is how most such threads on these topics go. Hackles get raised, people dig in, and instead of proposing solutions, there seem to be 50 pages of "Fuck you! You're WRONG!" <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/>\n<blockquote>In other words, James asked the Interesting Question, and has begun thinking of practical solutions, with this:</blockquote>\nThanks. Normally I'd just get on board the Fuck You Express, though recently it has come to my intention that this produces ZERO results for anybody (well, past ensuring a Fuck You Future). In another part of my life, this has become abundantly clear over the past three years. I figured that it was time I try something different in this part of my life, as well. \n<blockquote>Agreed. And thanks for that, too. I found this thread really unsatisfying in this latter part, without being able to put my finger quite on why: It lacked action.</blockquote>\nBlame the medium. Action is something that happens offline, out there in the real world. Discussion forums are for discussing things. When something needs to get done, one has to unplug and <i>do it</i>. \n<blockquote>So, let's make that assumption that Gareth is correct.</blockquote>\nNo assumption needed. If somebody, anybody, perceives a problem as existing, it exists. Maybe not for everybody. Maybe not for <i>most</i> most people. But for that one guy, or that handful of people, it's as real as the Earth is round. Which brings me to. . . \n<blockquote>There's a problem, and it's a problem that people should be able to do something about. What are things that people can actually do, given the problem GMS proposes?</blockquote>\nRealistically, the answer that I proposed earlier is the best one. Nobody can force other people to be genuinely less exclusive or more accomodating. These behaviors will only come about as a result of change on a personal level, and that change will only come about as the result of a personal choice. You want good faith? Here it is. . . <br/><br/>I believe that we can make personal commitements to be more welcoming, less condescending, more open to a wider pallette of ideas, less compartmentalized, and generally more pleasant people. I believe that the next time we want to call somebody a "troll" without first considering what they have to say or shoot down an idea before actually taking it for a test drive, we can stop, play that tape through, and self-correct. <br/><br/>In fact, here's my personal commitment: <br/><br/>For the next month, I will not discard an idea or argument out of hand. I will not enshrine my anecdotal experience as universally applicable. I will make an effort to listen to and understand, from another's point of view, every new idea or argument that is put in front of me -- no matter how disingenuous it may seem. <br/><br/>Now, here's what <i>you</i> can do: <br/><br/>Hold me to it. For the next month, If you see me doing any of those things which I have said I won't do, or not doing any of those things which I said I will -- call me on my bullshit. I can't guarantee that I'll give you a big fat hug right away, but I <i>can</i> guarantee that I'll give you one sooner than later (along with an apology). <br/><br/>Here's what <i>we</i> can do: <br/><br/>Everybody can make a personal commitment as I did above. Get a ticket for the Brotherly Love Line, make a commitment to change some potentially flawed personal behaviors, and put some control in the hands of others. Trust each other. Build some bridges.

Cliques? Dump 'em. Dismiss ideas out of hand? Don't do it. Tell people that they don't get it? Cut that shit out. All of this is, as I outline above, change that begins on a personal level. Now, here's the deal. . . <br><br>Admitting that one has personal flaws isn't an exercise in self-doubt. It's an exercise in personal betterment. More importantly, it's an exercise in humility and open-mindedness. Being self-assured is good. Being closed to the mere possibility that one may be less than perfect isn't -- it means that you close the door to personal improvement and, thus, the improvement of the hobby. <i>We all have room for improvement</i>. <br/><br/>See my personal commitment above. I'm putting myself out there. I would wholeheartedly encourage others to do the same.  \n<blockquote>This sounds interesting, but I would like to hear the idea developed more: What are you meaning here by "Attitude" (I'm assuming "attitude" does not include "being dismissive" given the last sentences).</blockquote>\nSpecifically, I mean "Hold your brother accountable" -- if the level of deviation from one's commitments warrants some strong words, use them. If not, don't. If X commits to make only positive contributions to Y online community for the next week, and you see him (or her) over there trolling the forums with shit like "Why your preferred style of game is WRONG" -- take a minute to say "Hey! Back the fuck up, man! You said that you'd make positive contibutions. Cut that shit out!" <br/><br/>The key is to make sure that the context is apparent and that it comes from <i>a place of love</i>. If you see that guy or gal trolling another forum after making a commitment not to, don't jump in with "Fuck you! You're a goddamn liar!" -- that is <i>clearly</i> not coming from a place of love, nor is it reminding that person of their commitment and holding them to it. It's jettisoning them out of the nearest airlock, shutting them down in an impersonal manner, and telling them to get lost.  <br/><br/>We all have bad days and we should be able to rely on one another for strength when we can't muster our own. <br/><br/>And, yeah, I'm aware that all of this sounds like some whacked-out New Age weird. But it <i>does</i> work. If people are willing to give it a shot, I'd be happy to explain (privately) how I know that it works. The big 'secret' is that it only works if you're willing <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90596">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Doug%20Ruff" title="Doug Ruff"><img alt="Doug Ruff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Doug%20Ruff">Doug Ruff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90596/#Comment_90596" name="Item_124" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-27T02:46:11+00:00" title="August 27, 2007  2:46AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi,<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the spirit if finding practical solutions:<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of the misconceptions that (I think) have been brought to light by this thread are:<br/>\n<br/>\n"D20 cannot be indie"<br/>\n<br/>\n"D20 cannot be used to produce the sort of games that indie gamers want to play"<br/>\n<br/>\n(for various definitions of "indie" that really aren't worth getting into an argument about)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, how about having a D20 game design challenge?<br/>\n<br/>\n- Doug                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90600">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90600/#Comment_90600" name="Item_125" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-27T03:16:43+00:00" title="August 27, 2007  3:16AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We are clashing into definitions again: you can have a d20 indie game.

Watch specific types of sentence construction:  <b><i>Particularly</i></b>, watch out for negative sentences (which say what something doesn't, or can't, do) and replace them with positive ones (which say what something does and can do).  If what you <i>have</i> is enthusiasm for one game or idea, don't <i>write</i> a put-down of something else.<br/>\n<br/>\n<u>Negative Sentence</u>:  "The <i>Hero's Journey</i> RPG gives me the Campbellian journey I crave in a way that <i>D&amp;D;</i> tried but never did."  Don't say this.<br/>\n<u>Positive Sentence</u>:  "<i>D&amp;D;</i> gets me really psyched up about the Campbellian journey.  I love the way that <i>Hero's Journey</i> grabs that structure and makes it really explicit."  Say this, by all means.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe simple fact is, most of us like many things ... including at least a few pairs of <i>diametrically opposed</i> things.  You can love the non-combat depth of <i>Breaking the Ice</i> and also adore the combat crunch of <i>D&amp;D;</i>.  Practicing how to express the positive about those, without accidentally slamming something, that's a useful exercise.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe structure of a sentence tells you a lot about that, IMHO.  If you <i>can't</i> express your thoughts as a sentence that's purely positive ... that might be a good time to kick in the old self-evaluation circuitry.  At least make sure that you're purposefully pissing people off and excluding them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy contrast, if your thought fits well into a purely positive sentence that doesn't denigrate anything else ... why would you want to accidentally clothe it in verbiage that might be offensive?<br/>\n<br/>\nCareful grammar and word choice.  It'll take you far.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90619">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90619/#Comment_90619" name="Item_129" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-27T06:17:02+00:00" title="August 27, 2007  6:17AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Negative Sentence</span>:  "The<em>Hero's Journey</em>RPG gives me the Campbellian journey I crave in a way that<em>D&amp;D</em>tried but never did."

The most common mistake I see people make in fora is praising an RPG for being better than some other RPG. The comparison itself will honk off anyone who thinks the latter RPG is just fine, thank you. Not to mention, nine times out of ten, it's an apple-and-oranges comparison that makes no sense anyway. The best thing, IMO, is to just talk about what an RPG does in play that makes you think it's so awesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90623">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90623/#Comment_90623" name="Item_130" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-27T06:43:50+00:00" title="August 27, 2007  6:43AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm briefly going to get slightly philosophical.  As long as we're talking about sentence construction, it's often useful to avoid overusing "to be" verbs, especially when what you're doing is giving opinions of things.  I used to be on a big "E-prime" kick (though I never managed to actually get it down), and while I still use plenty of "is-es" and "are-s" and the like, I have tried to cut down on them.  I find it useful to try to recognize that if I say something like "D&amp;D is a lousy game because it has too much mechanical crunch and combat takes forever" I'm phrasing my personal opinion as if it were a law of nature. Trying to make sure you phrase personal opinions and beliefs as what they are and not as irrefutable rock-hard laws can go a long way.

When I'm at ENWorld, say, I try to just focus on generalities. "I like it when games do X." "I think it's more fun when..." When I do name-drop an indie RPG, I avoid comparisons. I try to just say things like, "<i>Burning Wheel</i> has this cool mechanic where..." and so forth. I also make an effort to keep my discussion in context. E.g., if people are talking about, say, social mechanics in D&amp;D, I don't start talking about how indie game X does it better. If I can contribute, I try to be relevant, e.g., "There are some cool mechanics from <i>Spycraft 2.0</i> you could use."<br><br>That said, there are times when I will stick by my guns, i.e., assert some theory that I feel is relevant or accurate. I do agree with most Forge-style theory, as well as, e.g., the great GM philosophy from SotC, and I'm not going to hide that. I just try not to be a jerkwad about it.<br><br>Not that I haven't ever been a slavering fanboy who maybe was a little too zealous. Thankfully, I got over that phase (or am in the process, at least).<br><br>In meatspace, I've certainly been guilty of a little evangelism, though mostly it's been discussion with my regular group. Thankfully, rather than alienate them, the ensuing discussion served to help me get to know them better, and I think our gaming has improved because of it.<br><br>I also organize the local ENWorld Gameday. It's a mostly d20-focused con, but small-press events have been more and more common, both due to my efforts and those of others. And that "small press" includes both "Forge-style" games and "trad-style" games; Bill Corrie of HinterWelt is a regular attendee, and his products are gloriously old-school. Thankfully, there's no snobbery or posturing, as everyone is pretty much there to play games and socialize. And there are more than a few regulars (like myself) who enjoy running and playing <i>Burning Empires</i> or SotC as much as they do D&amp;D or <i>Call of Cthulhu</i>.<br><br>I don't know if I completely self-identify as "indie." I certainly play D&amp;D WAY more than I do any of the indie stuff I own. All I know is that I love good RPGs. For me, those are mostly coming from the small-press folk these days. They inspire me to improve my gaming, regardless of system, and to hopefully get other people interested in small-press product as well. Hopefully, I do it without coming off like a dick.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90627/#Comment_90627" name="Item_132" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-27T06:59:41+00:00" title="August 27, 2007  6:59AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Compare and contrast:<br/>\n<br/>\n(1) "Shaolin Beef gives me all the combat options of Killcrazy, but without the horrid and stifling mechanical crunch."<br/>\n(2) "Killcrazy has too much mechanical crunch in combats.

All it says is this: <br><br>Does the person who created the thing call the shots on the money? Does that creator (or people) decide all money decisions, like when to print, how to print, whether or not to use distribution (and many other comparable decisions)? If yes, it's indie.

"Small press" is not useful (Burning Empires). "Story based games" is not useful (Agon, Helios Rising D20 products, etc.). Anti-D&amp;D or D20 is not useful (um, Me, Ben Lehman, Chris Chinn, Buzz, many many others).<br/><br/>It's why, for example, anyone "excluding" Guy McLimore or S. John Ross is being a schmuck. They own their stuff, as far as I know. They call the shots. If they didn't create stuff they own, then it's time to re-evaluate (Does Guy hire freelancers to write stuff, for example? I dunno. I'm pretty sure Ross has lots of his own material and calls the shots on it.). <br/><br/>The reason Pinnacle does not, to the best of my limited knowledge, meet that definition is that they possess a vast range of products and content for which the creators (the writers, primarily) do not call the shots.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

I mean, one of the main draws of belonging to an "indie" group is that you are identifying yourself against a "mainstream", and you are essentially taking a stand for your principles (art! design! vision! creativity!) against corporate mediocrity over principles for money. <br/><br/>I think it's actually pretty hard to say that you're standing up for individual creativity and freedom all that shit and then and then saying, "incidentally, I'm getting more cash per unit sold here".

The creator is still, very much, controlling the creative direction of the game.    The "Indie" definition doesn't understand this, or take it into account.<br/><br/>To say that it's "all about who gets the money" -- in most creator-owned companies that I'm familiar with, the freelancers often get paid far more than the creator-owner.  As owner of the company, most of the money that he or she sees goes back into production, paying for booth space, hiring more freelancers, etc.    So again, a core misunderstanding of how things actually work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90657">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90657/#Comment_90657" name="Item_141" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-27T09:43:57+00:00" title="August 27, 2007  9:43AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're using "creator" in a different way than I am.<br/><br/>Your "creator" seems to me to be "the progenitor of a series of creative works, who may or may not have anything to do with the authoring them."<br/><br/>My "creator" is "the author of the work.

The creator is still, very much, controlling the creative direction of the game. The "Indie" definition doesn't understand this, or take it into account.<br/><br/>I'm not so sure it's not <i>understood</i>, Gareth, give the number of former freelancers who are now indie/small-press publishers on their own. It may not be taken into account, but I don't necessarily think it's widely misunderstood.<br/><br/>But you hit on something for me: my definition of "indie" (when I use the term, which I don't usually do, preferring "small-press") does place some emphasis on the creator directly creating art/text for a product rather than doing development work and managing freelancers.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GMSkarka</cite>To say that it's "all about who gets the money" -- in most creator-owned companies that I'm familiar with, the freelancers often get paid far more than the creator-owner. As owner of the company, most of the money that he or she sees goes back into production, paying for booth space, hiring more freelancers, etc. So again, a core misunderstanding of how things actually work.</blockquote>\nI think "who gets the money" is meant to be "who has financial responsibility" rather than "who gets the biggest paycheck."<br/><br/>But you are 100% right about re-sinking revenues into the company.<br/><br/>CU                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90662">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GMSkarka" title="GMSkarka"><img alt="GMSkarka" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v385/GMSkarka/tinyadamant.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GMSkarka">GMSkarka</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90662/#Comment_90662" name="Item_144" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-27T09:55:30+00:00" title="August 27, 2007  9:55AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite><acronym><acronym>You're using "creator" in a different way than I am.<br/><br/>Your "creator" seems to me to be "the progenitor of a series of creative works, who may or may not have anything to do with the authoring them."<br/><br/>My "creator" is "the author of the work.

It wasn't about identifying oneself against the mainstream. It was a bunch of folks saying, "you don't have to shop your game around to publishers. All the tools are available to publish it yourself. And if you do it right, you'll probably make more money than you would by selling it to a publisher."<br/><br/>As well as some folk saying, "None of these games really give me the experience that I'm looking for.

Why would a principled approach to intellectual property be negated by something practical like desiring more revenue per unit?<br/><br/>One of the attractions and very good reasons for going the indie route is a good chance at a greater return on your effort than other approaches. That's not to say there aren't compelling reasons to take other approaches as well. There are and they should be weighed if you're considering making a game.<br/><br/>The one thing none of us like to see, indie or not, is someone pouring their heart and soul into a work, investing heavily into it (especially with borrowed resources), and then finding themselves unable to recoup.

Can we agree some people misapprehended his intent due to the perceived tone of his language and just move on?  And Gareth, I think you've raised a really interesting question about group identity, I appreciate the discussion and continued input, but it doesn't move things forward to keep going back into a defensive posture.<br/><br/>The virtue of the economic definition of "indie" here IMO comes from its objective qualifier.  No fiddly subjective assessments apply.  That said, I don't invest myself in that definition since I don't buy games according to that criterion.  Fine.  I prefer to go back to the constructive discussion about how to increase the inclusive attitude of this community.  To that end, I'd suggest that maybe the Story Games community does not match exactly with the "indie games" community, since the former also consists of players and consumers unaware of the economic definition and who participate in the community's discussions on play style, craft, and non-indie games.  We may see a substantial overlap, but they're not the same groups.  So perhaps we ought to take another look at what community means in the first place.

We have recognized plenty of games like Artesia, JAGS, EABALite, Perfect20, and others.  <br><br>However, the awards definition of "indie" is basically in line with Ben's and Chad's.  The author is the person who writes the text.  I don't think that's an unreasonable definition.  Now, the producer may also be a huge influence  on the work by giving very specific directions to the author.  I certainly do take into account how freelance work is done, but the end result of my consideration is sticking by the same definition as my predecessor Andy.  I realize that there is a common case of a producer giving detailed directions to a freelance author, who then writes the work and gets paid a flat fee without having control over how the work is edited and published.  I recognize that and I don't think there is anything wrong with that, but it is not "indie" by the award's definition.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90740">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdrakeh" title="jdrakeh"><img alt="jdrakeh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/909/nZA3BEK4G6OHW.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdrakeh">jdrakeh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90740/#Comment_90740" name="Item_153" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-27T13:23:59+00:00" title="August 27, 2007  1:23PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I whispered to somebody that what I'd really like to see is people working <i>together</i> to get things done. Not necessarily in terms of demeanor, but in terms of creating things. Now, I know that IPR, The Forge, and Story Games all support this a <i>bit</i> but, in the end, each <i>game</i> is still the equivalent of a one-man band. Which is great, in some respects. I like designing my own things. I'm the primary audience. If other people like them, very cool. If they don't, no sweat off my back. Also, there's the whole "confidence building" angle. There's nothing quite so satisfying as doing something yourself, doing it well, and getting praise for it. That rocks. I won't lie and say that this isn't a draw for a lot of indie designers. We all know that it is. That said, this kind of one-man operation also does a lot to compartmentalize the hobby and and the indie "movement" on the backend. So. . . <br><br>Here's another Thing We Can Do: <i>create a game together</i>. And, yes, I mean in the "Super Friends" sense. For example: Judd doing layout, Keith doing interior art, Paul doing a hand-painted cover, Gareth and Justin doing d20-ish rules, etc. Somebody will inevitibly argue that "Too many chefs in the kitchen spoils the soup" which may be true. That said, I'd like to point out that "too many chefs" are also responsible for things like Velvet Revolver, Black Sabbath, and The European Renaissance. When you have a bunch of <i>great</i> chefs in one kitchen, sometimes, the soup just <i>KICKS ASS</i>. And, of course, nothing ventured, nothing gained. We may just end up making some funky soup. We may make the Soup of Ages. But we'll never know which we're capable of unless we get give it a try. <br><br>We might even make it a friendly competition of this and break up in teams of four or five, making an effort to work with folks whom we normally wouldn't (for whatever reason), and cook a full-course meal of BADASSITUDE.

Mind, folks are really busy and all with games and real life post-con-season (probably the busiest time of the year, given fiscal year just started and all that, too).

And to anyone who knows the history between us two, agreeing on much of anything I am pretty sure brings a taste of bile into each of our mouths.<br/>\n<br/>\nIndie from where I see it, despite the assumption that it is suppose to be all about "creator owned" really is more about an artsy independent attitude. If you have that attitude, then you are welcome open armed into the community of like minded individuals. If you don't, you are not.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, in the history of the Guild of Blades out of about 250 products published there have been a grand total of 5 products that were not, in some part, written and designed by either myself, my partner Bruce, or both of us. Technically speaking, by indie definition, we're it. Yet in the past I can definitely tell you there were a couple times were we were clearly excluded from participation based on the perception we were not "indie enough".<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically I see the "indie" attitude largely as the "we're designers for the love it" camp vs the "they're all in it for the money", which in our industry is rather sort of laughable. I mean really, you officially become "The Man" when your company grows enough to employ one person full time? And as artists and independent minded creative folk there is an expectation for "indie" folks to rile against "the man".<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll try and paint a rather clear distinction and why even though we design and publish our own games here we are not now indie and never have been. Of the publishers here, please raise your hand if your business plan has a clearly defined manner to take your company from its part time operation it is now and grow it into a larger outfit where you are employed full time professionally making games? While I'll grant we certainly never broke any speed records getting there (took us about 7 years of publishing part time), that was always our goal.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the indie model I just don't think that IS the goal at all. People are pretty happy making some games and turning some bucks and being in the black rather than the red, but there isn't nearly as much emphasis on wether it shold ever grow beyond that.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, what does that all mean? Not much, other than to point out that to "some" people within the self classified indie group, there are some who view it as being all about the artwork and due to the differential in end goals, they percieve anyone trying to run a larger outfit is "selling out". The very definition of creator owned as I often see it presented absolutely proves that point. "creator owned" is wher you do almost all the actual content...except for artwork, which for some reason just doesn't seem to fall under that category, likely out of necessity since few game designers are also professional enough artists to do the work itself. So, the Guild's game 1483 Online, even though it was born from and is a near exact duplicate of my board game design Europe 1483, had the more sophisticated game code programmed by someone other than me, would not thus still be creator owned because I didn't do the more than 51% of the grunt work? And why exactly would this be different than an indie RPG designer farming out the illustrations, editing and actual book production somehow be less "farming out" of the work exactly? And it just happens to be that the vast majority of the companies that have achieved a sustainable income to employ the owners full time and perhaps a small staff, out of necessity of project management, farm out more of the editing, some of the writing, artwork, etc, either to freelancers or staffers. Its the absolute only way they can continue to get "their vision" of the games they want to produce into print with the desired quality, volume and schedule required for that business. And before anyone says that's where the sell out occurs, I say bunk, because as the creator director on such projects the "owner" still gets it done the way he wants, but sometimes can actually afford better artwork, better layouts, better editing and sometimes even better writing because let's be frank, ven though WE ALL wear many hats in our game design and publishing endevours, we are NONE OF US masters of each function we do.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it should also be noted long before the indie scene grew into the movement it is today, there were equally powerful sub groups of people. The wargaming market has a similar insular ideals mindset and only due to the rapid development of a growing base of desk top wargame publishers are the old perceptions of that insular group beginning to change. I've seen this exact same thing is at least a dozen different groups within the game industry. And its not necessarily a bad thing. Everyone wants to find their niche and a group of like minded folks. But sometimes you have to remember other people doing it another way is also perfectly valid and should not be looked down on. I mean, seriously, attitudes like that remind me of those teen movies where the ultra snooty girls group looks down on the "girl outside the click" for not wearing the same fashion or something.<br/>\n<br/>\nI sort of get the impression that Gareth just has never landed in one of those niches and I can feel pretty safe in saying I and the Guild never did either. I would suggest that perhaps everyone should avoid doing so, frankly. Broader horizons and all that. I would suggest that many indie designers, especially those very vocal among the indie sites, are very open to new design ideals, but often very closed to new business ideals (ala, anything that falls outside the creator owned, sell direct approach). And let's be real here, new ways to get your games "out there" is ultimately every bit as important as the "new game" being presented.<br/>\n<br/>\nRyan S.

That is where e-mails and instant messages become phone calls and shared meals.<br/><br/>This isn't about the word -indie- and it isn't about a secret cancer that is eating at the heart of the community.  This is about some people, looking in, who can't figure out why some people are tight and they might feel like outsiders.<br/><br/>I'd imagine most of them haven't met many of us face to face and sat down and gamed with us.<br/><br/>That is where the rubber meets the road and where friendships are made.<br/><br/>This isn't to say that we are all fucking friends, singing kumbaya and making with the group hugs.<br/><br/>Some of us find that we don't really like each other or don't really like how the other games.  And that is okay.  We find our niches and find the gaming we like and move on.<br/><br/>That is what these forums are about (besides geeking out about how cool Githyanki are).  They are about finding the games you like to play and if there aren't any, helping you design 'em.<br/><br/>But shit happens and we forget that and get into posturing and defining words and shit.<br/><br/>I'm rambling.<br/><br/>Hope that made some kind of sense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90895">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90895/#Comment_90895" name="Item_166" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-28T05:46:39+00:00" title="August 28, 2007  5:46AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ryan, interesting thoughts.

At the Forge booth? On the Forge? Somewhere else? Here at Story Games? What was the conversation like? (I don't really care who; people have a real bug up their nose about naming names.) I just want some specifics on what's happening, what you're alleging. I'm not aware of any such incidents, and I'm skeptical, frankly.

I think the forge (and here I use the forge as a shorthand for a segment of the indie community) may be more open to a broader swath of games now than it has in the past.  This is entirely subjective, certainly, but not unreasonable, I hope.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I'm taking that as a given and I'm left with one question: What's changed?<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, if the answer is "Nothing's changed, these people who felt rebuffed misunderstood.  They're welcome and they always have been." then well and good, as much as I disagree.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if it's not, then this question seems important to me. Were I one of these folks it would be reasonable of me to wonder if the new openness is just a matter of light being shone on the issue, which would leave me with a pretty sour taste in my mouth.  It would leave me feeling like it would be a risk to get into those waters now, since this welcome may vanish as quickly as it appeared.  If the community is the same as it was when a person was rebuffed, what can we point to now and say "this is different, this is why that's not a worry anymore?"<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, having raised the question, I'll at least take a poke at the answer - the diaspora really _has_ changed the nature of the community, and in ways I find entirely pleasing.    Many of the same forces that make it less and less apt to use the terms "indie" and "forge" synonymously  are changing the boundaries of the community, in really good ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, if that's true, it also underscores why the Gareths and TIms and Ryans of the world don't need to go to the forge anymore.  No sleight - it's a great resource for a number of things - but it is now just one more place among many. This community has strong roots there, so it's always going to be a hometown favorite, but it's no longer what is indie.  It's just the forge.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOr so I hope.  In reality, it's more of a muddle because it's in transition.  The Forge has had ownership of what is Indie for so long that even when it's passed beyond that, that idea of it being a gatekeeper lingers.  And that's bad for everyone. People with an unpleasant history with the forge find that tainting current interaction.  And the forge itself keeps suffering from this idea of what it is (which can suck) overshadowing what it actually is (which it excels at).  The simple problem is that people like acknowledgment, and anyone can call themselves indie, but it falls flat without someone else agreeing.  Historically that someone is the Forge, but now....it's no one.  And that's how it should be, I think, but it sure as hell isn't easy.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs any of it actionable?  Hell, I dunno.  And I'll probably keep avoiding the word indie until I do.  Maybe forever - hell, it's not like it makes any real difference in who I'd want to talk about games with, or what games I'd buy.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Rob D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90928">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90928/#Comment_90928" name="Item_168" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-28T07:31:56+00:00" title="August 28, 2007  7:31AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rob Donoghue</cite>Now, I'm taking that as a given and I'm left with one question: What's changed?<br/><br/>Now, if the answer is "Nothing's changed, these people who felt rebuffed misunderstood.

I think that there's one thing on which we absolutely agree, and that is that there is a perception of elitism in the Forge-based movement. I have a whole lot of points to make about this:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) The Forge has it's definition of indie, and sticks to it pretty damn well. I had to convince Ron to give Universalis a forum because he questioned whether a game written and owned by two individuals was still indie. No, really. The issue isn't so much one of exclusion, but of having a definition that can be applied with rigor, and, importantly, is not a slippery slope. Because...<br/>\n<br/>\n2)... if you allow Pinnacle to be called indie, then the term has no meaning. As Gareth contends, most everyone in RPGs is indie if you don't make the definition very narrow. So the question is whether or not the narrow definition is valuable...<br/>\n<br/>\n3)... and the definition is valuable, because of two things:<br/>\nA) Yes it's economic to some extent. Basically games that would not otherwise get published do get published under this model. That is, with th the traditional model, a game has to be seen as commercially viable before it's published to get published. With the indie movement all sorts of crazy ideas can, and do, get published. But not just economic...<br/>\nB) It's about quality to some extent. Which is not to say that all "indie" RPGs are good, some are terrible. But the hope is that, if there are no economic constraints on publishing, that the vision published will, yes, be more "pure." Unadulterated by other considerations. Let's talk about this more...<br/>\n<br/>\n4) Do indie RPGs really turn out better? Well, actually, in some ways, I'll admit, they turn out worse. That is, not having the resources of a team, they tend to be less well edited, for instance. Perhaps the layout on this one game isn't as good as it should be. Some indie RPGs, their designers flush with the realization that they can rush to market, do so without enough playtesting (an issue we've gone to lengths to try to fix of late). Uh, yeah, these games are "indie" in the same way that an independent record label may have less resources, and are, in some ways, more "junky." <br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, from a POV of traditionalists about what makes a game a good value, I'd posit that the indie RPG movement makes much worse games on average than the mainstream market does. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut... from the POV of somebody who likes to try out avant garde ideas, who isn't so concerned with production values, and who is willing to sift through a lot of games that they might not like all that well even... for somebody like myself, there are gems produced by the indie movement that are, to our subjective desires, far superior to any that can be found on the mainstream market. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don't like My Life With Master because I have a credit in the game, or because I'm a friend of Paul's, or that I helped playtest it, or that it's "indie." I like My Life with Master, because, when I've run it, or played in it, I have a hell of a good time. An experience of a sort that I've never had with any traditional RPG. So, yes...<br/>\n<br/>\n5) We think that these games are superior. Well, again, not all, but as a movement that there is a value in having a mindset where games like MLWM get produced. Godlike, for all it's interesting features, and Greg's amazing artistic input, plays very traditionally in my experience, and, for me, that's just not very fun. Whether that's because it's somehow technically "indie" or not, I can't say. But the game comes off as very traditional in that it's got everything that you'd expect from such a product, and little to nothing of the sort that you see coming out of the "indie" community. <br/>\n<br/>\nReign, OTOH, while still having a lot of traditional components, has some mechanics that really are innovative in this way. Greg is certainly capable of innovation - we see this with his Madness Meters in UA, which was well before he got involved with the indie community. But if his association with the community has, in any way, made Greg more willing to put in his innovations into his games, I think that's a good thing. <br/>\n<br/>\n6) Can we ever know? I mean Greg can come here and accept or deny the affect of the indie paradigm on his designing. But who can say what's affecting what to what extent precisely. Maybe Greg would have made Reign even if he'd not had the inspiration of the indie community. I don't know. All I do know is that the atmosphere of indie design seems to have resulted in the RPGs that I, for one, have always wanted. And which I think lots of people want. <br/>\n<br/>\n7) Interestingly, "lots" isn't very many. That is, it's hard to make an overall economic argument that independent is the way to go, when no "indie" RPG has ever made enough money to keep a staff paid full-time - the dream of many designers that we can quit our daytime jobs, and go just design RPGs all day long. Ron's contention has always been that this dream is largely a pipe-dream. The extent to which this is true may well depend on your perspective. Maybe we're all just self-limiting ourselves by not trying to get into a three-tier production model with a supplement treadmill designed to keep core game sales evergreen... but I've been very comfortable with where things have gone, personally. <br/>\n<br/>\n8) So, in fact, we ARE being elitist. We think that our games are better... for us (we who self-select to be designers in the community, or customers of the products), if for nobody else. <br/>\n<br/>\n9) Does that mean that we get to ridicule everyone else? No. Does it mean that we'll sometimes be selective about what gets the label and what doesn't? Yep. Will we always do a good job of that? No, only human. But...<br/>\n<br/>\n10) Do we disclude D20 or other "traditional" products based solely on them having these qualities? No. Obviously Brennan started out with a D20 product he designed, the Forge Booth has always, to my recollection, had D20 products at it. Do people think we have a problem with D20? Yes, and that's because, though we let those products get sold, they run counter to a lot of indie sentiment in terms of their design features, and so we're usually simply not that interested in them. The D20 products at the booth often languish because people don't know how to sell them well. But that's only part of the picture...<br/>\n<br/>\n11) Ron actually knows most of these better than the rest of the community, interestingly. Assign whatever motive you want to this, he's done his part to reach out. And even yet, with this support, those products don't sell well at the booth. Why? Becuase people coming to The Forge booth expect more Polaris and My Life with Master, not D20 stuff. Just a fact of expectation. So, purely as a marketing thing, it might make sense to do as Alex says, especially if there are enough such D20 products to fill a booth. And I say that understanding that...<br/>\n<br/>\n12) It's a BS distinction, at it's base. That is, I'm sure of two things. First, there's no reason why a D20 game using OGL or whatever can't be as innovative or even more interesting than any other indie RPG. I've yet to see one that really blows my socks off in this regard. Some have come close, like M&amp;M. But that's my predilections, and there's no reason why there can't be a market for such products (there is), or why somebody won't, some day, produce that mind-blowing game for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nContiunes two posts below...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90934">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades" title="guildofblades"><img alt="guildofblades" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades">guildofblades</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90934/#Comment_90934" name="Item_170" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-28T07:44:31+00:00" title="August 28, 2007  7:44AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            &gt;&gt;Matt_Snyder wrote"<br/>\nDid people prevent you from acting or participating somewhere?

I'm guessing that he's not responding to you, because he doesn't want people to feel that he's taking this personally (which makes sense, we shouldn't be looking at it that way). But, to be clear, Gareth was with us at gaming tables long before you showed up, Josh. I can distinctly recall sitting with him in the Breezeway one evening at Origins. Now, interestingly the discussion came around to Ron, and Gareth didn't have much complimentary to say about Professor Edwards. Which, I'll admit, may have strained the social situation a bit, given that I'd like to think that I'm a friend of Ron's. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut there's no doubt in my mind that Gareth was being honest. He may rub you the wrong way at times, but that's just because he doesn't mince words. Which is, overall, fine with me. He knows many of us personally, and we know him to some extent. Any misunderstandings here aren't soley because of internet interference. They're not going to suddenly get ironed out by him meeting with us face to face. <br/>\n<br/>\nGareth's point is valid, insamuch as it comes down to "don't be a dickhead." Or where it's "do more things like the Indie Passport." If and where it might be, "don't pretend like your products are better than anyone elses..." that's where I have to disagree. No, by some measures they're not objectively better. But for some people, by some subjective measures, they are better. If that makes me some snobby elitist, well then so be it. <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that make Gareth's work less good somehow? Not bloody likely. I've always admired your work, Gareth, and I think that your ideas on Intuitive Continuity were important in spurring on much of the game technique that has become standard Forge-promoted stuff. We actually owe you a debt of gratitude for being one of those initial designers who were on the cutting edge, and who showed that it was a fine place to be (along with Tweet and Laws, et al.) I can't see a damn reason why, with your current model, anyone would foolishly try to exclude you. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, yeah, actually I buy your annectdotal evidence. That is, given the number of examples you give, that's not just a personal issue, but indicative of a phenomenon in general. The Jeff Dee incident is another data-point here (for those unfamiliar, Jeff was interested in the scene until somebody decided to tell him off as not being "indie" enough). <br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing is, I don't think that being proud of what the community produces is the same as ostracizing others. That is, we can be proud, while not kicking others in the shins. So, yes, if people are conflating these two separate attitudes, that needs to stop. But the pride needs to go on. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I think that it's largely pride that does happen. Rather, I think that the attitude that we propound is one of pride, and not of exclusionary-ness. Given that this is the principle we espouse, I don't know that there's a problem that can be solved. The asses will be asses. And pride or feelings of outsiderness (as in Rob's case), will get misinterpreted as a cliquish attitude. We can try to be ecumenical, but that'll only serve so well. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo some extent there's a near neccessity that the "punk" movement seem to be outside of the rest of the culture. Or it's meaningless. You can feel that it's meaningless already, but that's unlikely to convince the rest of us that this is true in the short term, when we've seen a lot of benefit from it. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90938">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90938/#Comment_90938" name="Item_172" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-28T07:46:05+00:00" title="August 28, 2007  7:46AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>People with an unpleasant history with the forge find that tainting current interaction.</blockquote>\nEureka. Nah, that couldn't be it could it? <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>Few people, least of all Gareth, are going to agree with me about this. I think that quote above is a major factor in people feeling excluded. <br/><br/>I see this as largely unresolvable. I have a pretty good idea which historical dust-up on the Forge taints Gareth's interactions. I know what happened. I have an opinion about it. I don't agree with Gareth. He has no reason, I'm sure, to agree with me about it. So it goes. <br/><br/>Now, much later, Gareth bothers to point out a criticism of the community (which, admittedly, is broader than just the Forge and has been for some time). It means he clearly has some level of interest in it, and maybe wants to get involved in some way. (I'd still like to know that, in a totally positive way!)<br/><br/>I think what Gareth is saying is "I dig what you guys are doing here, and I want to get involved in some way. But, I really got something stuck in my craw about it a while  back. Do something about that."<br/><br/>And, I can't do shit for Gareth on that one. Well, I could, but I won't. I don't agree with him. I could say, "Aw, Gareth, sorry what happened years ago, we, the Forge, were wrong." But, I think that's bogus. Now, Gareth could do the same thing in return "Hey, I reacted to strongly" or whatever. But, I  have no reason to think that he will. His prerogative. Life's ok.<br/><br/>So, this is why I asked him, quite earnestly I might add, what specifically could be done. Because where <i>his</i> perception is feeling excluded, <i>my</i> perception is feeling like people like Gareth -- and you, Rob -- can't get that reaction out of the minds whether or not its currently relevant. (I think it is not, but he and you need not agree, of course.)<br/><br/>So, I repeat, quite earnestly without "gotcha" intent: If there is something specific that could be done, what do you (you meaning anyone) think that is?

I've played with the Baker's kids and slept on their floor.  I've slept on Judd's floor with Joshua, Emily, and Julia.  I've driven cross-country with Shreyas and Thomas and all the people on the trek this year.  I've shared GenCon rooms with loads of people.  I've lived just "down the road" from Dev, Ben, Andy, Jason, Clinton, and Remi.  I occasionally see Jared and Luke at our weekly games meetup.  The playing-games-with-people thing is also really important, but that's really only one part of it.  We are, in a very important sense, family to each other.<br/><br/>This is not something that just happens without people making the effort to make connections and get to know each other.  I can see how that sense of community can seem elitist and alienating to outsiders.  Heck, I once felt very much like an outsider myself, even though I hung out on the Forge.  All these other people had known each other for years, through the kinds of ties that I now have with people, and I wasn't connected like that.  Now, over the past few years, that's changed dramatically and I do feel like I'm connected into this community.<br/><br/>And it's not like that should be some sort of entry requirement.  You shouldn't feel like you HAVE to sleep on people's floors in order to be accepted by them.  But I do think there is a different kind of online relationship that exists between people who have shared that closeness in the real world.  And that kind of relationship is pretty difficult (maybe even impossible) to replicate without spending time hanging out with people in person.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90952">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90952/#Comment_90952" name="Item_175" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-28T08:15:22+00:00" title="August 28, 2007  8:15AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>I'm going to disagree with you on this one, for once, Matt.

Anyone in the vague area of New Jersey owes it to themself to check it out.  It's a great con with a strong indie presence, pretty much however you define the term.  It's a great opportunity to play your ass off and to meet a bunch of people in the cloud face to face.  It rocks.<br/><br/>Having framed it thus, at the last Dexcon, Chuck Godin was on hand demoing the new Changeling.  For those who don't know him, Chuck's written about 50 books for White Wolf, and after playing his demo, I invited him to dinner with a couple of us.  Short form, Chuck was a really, really cool guy who was interested in what all these crazy guys had to say.  He got bombarded by the Fred Hicks game love cannon, walked away with an armful of IPR games, and had a great panel on breaking into the industry (which Matt <b>W. dammit</b> and I were both attending because we wanted to make sure the self-publication arm of the universe was represented).  So far as I can tell, he had a really good time and had a lot of positive things to say about the experience.  However, he also had one other thing stick out to him: when he introduced himself to one of the indie crowd, and said he wrote for White Wolf, the immediate response was "I'm sorry."<br/><br/>Now, I do not doubt for an instant that it was meant in jest.  But to Chuck it came across as snarky and deserving of a good neck punching, and I don't really blame him.<br/><br/>Did it undo all the rest of the good of the con? Of course not.  But that, that right there?  If we could not do _that_, that would probably be good enough for me.<br/><br/>-Rob D.<br/><br/>PS - And to be clear, I'm as guilty of this as the next guy.  When the sincere, interesting guy at the design panel got to talking about his game and abruptly dropped in references to fighters and magic users, I totally got that unpleasant asshole-tightening sensation.  Sure, some of it was based off my impressions that it's him using a system that does not support his own ends, but some of it was snobbery, both against D&amp;D for non-dungeon crawling and based on the fact that I clearly knew many more game systems than this guy.  I go out of my way to squash down that response, but it's there, and it's crappy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90954">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90954/#Comment_90954" name="Item_177" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-28T08:20:22+00:00" title="August 28, 2007  8:20AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            TOTALLY MINOR CLARIFICATION: Matt S. in Rob's post is not me.

He said:<br/><br/>"The thing is, I don't think that being proud of what the community produces is the same as ostracizing others. That is, we can be proud, while not kicking others in the shins. So, yes, if people are conflating these two separate attitudes, that needs to stop. But the pride needs to go on."<br/><br/>and he also said:<br/><br/>"If and where it might be, "don't pretend like your products are better than anyone elses..." that's where I have to disagree."<br/><br/>Pride is awesome.  If it doesn't get out of hand.  When I was hanging out around the Forge Booth at Gen Con, and at the Ashcan Front, and at some of the other places on the Passport, I could tell people were proud of their games.  Their pride made them excited, and because they were excited about their games, they wanted to tell me about them, or get me to demo with them, and their excitement was contagious.  It made ME excited about the games.  At the Forge booth Ron roped me into a really fast demo of Carry, and damn was he excited about it!  I did not buy Carry that day, but I'll say this, I went from being mildly interested by it to putting it up there on my "List of Games I Ought to Pick Up SOON"<br/><br/>But pride can also get out of hand.  If someone is so damn proud about their game they start feeling the need to tell people why it is the BEST GAME EVAR and all other games SUCK in comparison (or even just that all, i dunno, d20, white wolf, or "non-indie" games suck in comparison) well that can really turn people off and fast.  Go ahead and BELIEVE that your game is the best thing there is, and by all means try to SHOW people how awesome it is by playing it with them or telling them about it.  Tell them ABOUT it and let your excitement and pride spread to them.  But don't TELL them that it's the best thing ever.  Don't try to compare it to other things and tell people that it's so much better than X, because people won't like that.

(I say that in all self-mockery.) Obviously, I can't speak to GMS's experiences; I'll speak to my own. I'm a pretty died-in-the-wool d20 guy. So I <i>should</i> be another of the "Yer Kind" referenced in the OP. I can say categorically that I have never -- literally, not even a <i>single</i> time -- been made to feel unwelcome in any of the "indie" RPG communities or by any of the "indie" RPG people. I cannot stress how literally I mean what I am saying. I've never heard a bad word from anyone on the Forge, here, Spin, RPGnet, RPG site, etc. I've never been made to feel unwelcome by Ron or Brennan or anybody else. I was a "charter member" of IPR. I've been at the Forge booth for two years now. (Indeed, I cannot say enough nice things about just how welcoming Ron has been to me in this regard.) I cannot say why my experience has been so diametrically different from GMS's. Is it because I'm a super-swell guy and he's ... prickly? Maybe. All I know is that I can't shed any light on the subject because I have no frame of reference from which to do so. (For the record, I'm also a big fan of GMS. Yes, he often comes off as, well, prickly, but he's also right 99% of the time, and that's of prime importance to me.)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Gregor Hutton</cite>Hey, Gareth<a href="http://gregorhutton.com/images/GenCon07/GenCon07-Pages/Image31.html" rel="nofollow">did stop by the IPR booth</a>at GenCon.

If they think I'm brain damaged or stupid or beneath them or elitist or whatever, that's fine, so long as their game is good."<br/><br/>And I'm sure you're not the only one that feels that way.<br/>But, as strange a person as I may be sometimes, I doubt *I'm* the only who feels the way I do.<br/>I don't generally want to be the game designer's friend, either.  But (and this is an extremely ridiculous comparison, I know, but I'm aware it's ridiculous and I'm doing it simply to make a point) I often don't like to buy oh, say, shoes from companies that utilize sweat shops filled with 8 year old south east Asian children.  I just don't feel like I should support that, no matter how damn awesome those shoes might be.  With "indie" game designers there is a really strong feeling of connection between the designer and the game.  When I think Dogs in the Vineyard I immediately think Vincent Baker.  If I think Vincent is a total asshole (and I don't, by the way; I've never met the man, so this should be viewed as a totally hypothetical situation) I, personally, will be unable to avoid associating the game with my negative feelings for the man.  Now, if your brain doesn't work that way, if you're capable of hating the designer and still loving the game, well more power to you.  I'm just saying that it might not be that way for everyone... so again, being overly obnoxious about how your game is completely and utterly better than everything else, and stating that everything else blows goats might not be a good way to entice people into buying your stuff.<br/><br/>Just throwing that idea out there.  Again, I'm not claiming that anyone actually IS a huge jerk (like I said, everyone I've had any direct interactions with have been totally kick-awesome) or that anyone actually IS taking that attitude about their games and the games of others.  I just wanted to suggest one possible consideration for why it MIGHT be a bad idea, financially speaking, to publicly and blatantly adopt that stance and attitude.<br/><br/>-brian<br/><br/><i>edited to fix a stupid typo.  stupid, stupid typos.  grrr.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91098/#Comment_91098" name="Item_194" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-28T14:08:50+00:00" title="August 28, 2007  2:08PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Psst!
