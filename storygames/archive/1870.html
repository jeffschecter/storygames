                    I'm working on a game using the Solar System. The settings is an alternate magical rennaisance Europe. One of the features of the setting is that Christianity never really got off the ground as a big social leader. Christians live in small mostly autonomous communities holding their possessions in common, forgiving their enemies, and loving their neighbors as best they can. It's as though Christianity stayed more or less in the form we see in the Acts of the Apostles. The big church in Europe is a centralized pagan religion with big rituals and divine powers handed down from the gods.<br/><br/>Eventually, someone's going to want to play a character who gets tied up with these strange folks who call themselves Christians. So what do I do when one of these characters sees a sick guy on the street and decides to heal him by God's power? I'd like my game to have a mechanic for miracles, but I'm not sure how to do it mechanically without having it suck or be ridiculous. Any insight?                </div>

                            There was a discussion of emulating superpowers at the CRNGames forum; there's useful suggestions there. For example, the Secret of Miracle Touch gives you access to start buying skills for Miracle Healing, which is just not an available skill for anyone otherwise.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Cerling</cite>How are you doing the magic powers of the "centralized pagan" religion, mechanically?</blockquote>
The pagan relgion ("The Ancient Church of Rome") has powers granted by Jupiter to the High Priest and through him hierarchically to all the priesthood. This reinforces the heirarchical nature of the church. Rituals are based on an ability roll. It's all about knowing which invocation to say and which god to invoke correctly. For that reason, I'd like to shy away from ability rolls for the Christian church. First to set them apart, second to distance them from the idea that God grants miracles because they're somehow "better at praying".
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Cerling</cite>How concerned are you that the mechanics model an actual Christian theology of miracles?</blockquote>
It would be cool if this happened, but only if it was cool in actual gameplay. I'd rather just leave miracles out than shoehorn a bunch of Theology into my game.                        </div>

                            In mine I just assigned the labels "virtuous" and "sinful" to some of the Keys (included the Seven Deadly Sins and their virtuous counterparts as Keys), and stated that the Pray ability check is at -1 for each sinful Key and +1 for each virtuous key that the character has. The Pray ability check is required to use any miraculous Secret. This isn't precisely a traditional theology of miracles, but it's close enough for jazz.                        </div>

                            All, right, cool... so here's an idea:<br/>
<br/>
<b>Secret of the Holy Spirit</b><br/>
Your character is indwelt by the Holy Spirit, a power that proceeds from God the Father through his Son Jesus Christ. You may pay XP to request God to perform miracles on your behalf. Tell the Story Guide what your character prays. Pay half an Advance to request a miracle that effects yourself, one Advance to request a miracle that affects yourself and one other person, or two Advances to request a miracle that affects a whole group of people. The Story Guide will work a fitting miracle into the story.<br/>
<br/>
...This creates the mechanical impression that this sect earns favor not by performing the right rituals, but by giving up something of themselves.                        </div>

                            Cool! Cool! Cool! Mike, I definitely like the idea of tying miracles to keys. Maybe characters can choose a key that embodies their relationship with their god/community/fellow people or something like that.<br><br>Adam, I also like the sacrificing aspect of it, although I don't want players to siphon off so much XP that their delaying transcendence indefinitely. <br><br>Jason, I agree. No self-serving miracles. What if you simply made it a prerequisite that the character cannot themselves benefit from a miracle? When a character performs a miracle they must explain how it benefits others, but does not benefit them. Attracting unwelcome interest from the rich, the powerful, and the status quo would be a good option.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            By "miracles that effect yourself," I was thinking firstly of characters who pray for divine revelation, gaining supernatural insight into a situation. But it would also cover classics like not being burned when tossed into a furnace, not being eaten when tossed to the lions, resisting the poison of venomous snakes, spontaneously speaking a language unknown to you, etc.<br><br>I think that's different from "self-serving," which can only be determined by the context of the entire scene (or story). It may certainly benefit me to suddenly be able to speak Latin when I first visit Rome -- but using my newfound language to spread the Gospel? That's why I was given the language in the first place.                        </br></br></div>

                            Sorry to necro this thread, but I totally just figured out the answer to my problem, and it's already built into TSOY. I want this concept of mircles in a way that retains some of the feeling of the legends of the early church. I don't want miracles to be "just another sort of magic", nor do I want them to be too open-ended. So here's how it works:<br><br/>There are a few secrets that represent fairly simple miracles. For example, the secret of tongues lets the character be understood in any language when they preach the gospel. The secret of healing lets a character heal wounds, possibly with a hefty pools expenditure. These secrets represent the miracles worked by someone who is essentially a minor saint. They include the caveat that the character has to live according to a loosely-defined code, probably requiring them to be poor and not gain power over their fellow people. So far so good. The player has a way to explore a particular kind of play experience through their character.<br/><br/>But what if the player wants the character to become one of the great saints of the age? That's exactly the kind of thing that Mathematica is meant to allow. The answer to the problem is transcendence. Once the player reaches the point where they're done exploring this character, they have the option of transcending and narrating how their character works a great miracle, becomes a great evangelist, is martyred, or whatever they desire. The character is, in a sense, too much a saint to be playable. <br/><br/>I may even work in specific special narrations that are only available to characters with specific secrets. Only Christians can become saints, only pagans can ascend to godhood, only alchemists can discover the philospher's stone... the possibilities are endless.<br/><br/>This works even better in Mathematica because the game is meant to be played in relatively short series with defined endgames. Playing a character through one or more series then transcending them to remain an NPC in the setting is completely appropriate to the game.<br/><br/>On the other hand, it still leaves the player room to decide that their saintly personage has fallen from grace and play out <i>that</i> experience, which is also exactly the kind of gameplay I want Mathematic to include.<br/><br/>By the way, thanks for helping out everyone. I don't think I could have figured out how I wanted to do this without someone to bounce the idea off of.                        </br></div>
