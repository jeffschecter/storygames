                    So, something that came up in our BitV game that several people commented on was our desire and enthusiasm for freeform play i.e. play that is not directly related to a conflict or even to furthering plot.  We wanted to just RP our characters and see what happened (with relationships, group dynamics, to flesh out personalities).  It also came up in the G&amp;S thread, noting how in the operettas, people often sang about what just happened, rather than moving on.<br/>
<br/>
So I was wondering, do you like freeform play?  Why?  Why not?  Do you want to freeform play even when the system isn't set up for it (like in Dogs where you have to specify you want it, otherwise play is centred around towns and their conflicts)?  Do you prefer to RP within conflicts rather than outside of them?<br/>

<p>Nancy,</p>
<p>I'm reluctant to call it "freeform" when it's play in a rules-/text-ful game; the text informs my play even when I don't engage its procedures, y'know? I want another word for it, that's not muddled (I was going to say 'contaminated' but that hardly seems fair, eh?) by confusing associations from like the freeform all-the-time community.</p>
<p>That said, I like this kinda stuff. It gives a way to reflect and process what happened in higher-tension play, and when I don't get it I'm forced to retreat to (less-satisfying) writing fiction about characters.</p>

                            With relationship to Dogs, specifically, everything up until the dice come out is "free play." As long as everybody's saying yes, you can do anything you want to. Now, scene framing aggressively to conflict, that's another thing entirely, but there's no real requirement to do that in Dogs play (or any other play).<br/>
<br/>
I don't think there's any such thing as "freeform", though - just conflictless and/or unstructured-drama-resolution play that's experienced/labelled as systemless.                        </div>

                            Shreyas, Mark--<br/><br/>do you have suggestions for another term?  (though I really don't want to get bogged down in terminoglogy, that's part of what scared me off The Forge)  I've defined what I meant when I said "freeform", so suggestions are welcome!  As a reminder, that definition was: <blockquote>play that is not directly related to a conflict or even to furthering plot.</blockquote>
Note I'm not talking about talking to locals, trying to figure out what's going on, or doing prep-work for a mission, but stuff like the dishwashing scene posted in the BitV log over on Sin Aesthetics.  In something like D&amp;D this could be talk happening as you're travelling from one place to another, or in just about any fantasy-based game, the party sitting around in a bar swigging ale.<br/><br/>--Nancy                        </div>

<h3>Man, I hate that shit!</h3>
More seriously, it depends on the game first.  It seems really out of place for my sensibilities regarding Dogs; however, in our Riverworld campaign this was de rigeur.  I like playing Dogs with a straight-to-conflict sort of immediacy, whereas Riverworld is a setting that pretty much exists to wander around aimlessly.                        </div>

                            Actually, I tend to find that the biggest tangilbe benefit to the freeformy type play is a greater investment in the game.  In the absence of strong conflict, problem solving, scene framing, or mechanics, you're left with exploration of charcater and setting, which tends to lead to a stronger interest in those chracters.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not saying that any of those things are antithetical, but play can shift to focus on one with the support of the others, if that makes sense.                        </div>

How do you feel about the more system-heavy parts of Dogs? Do you want them to end, so you can get back to freeforming? Or do you quite like them, but you like the freeforming in between as variety? Or what?<br/>

                            To be totally clear, I don't think "that sucks." It does all the cool stuff that Judson mentioned. As for a term, call it freeform if that's what you're comfortable with. I tend to call it "free play" or "exploration" because to me "freeform" specifically denotes either Scandinavian-style scenario larp play or unstructured Drama-resolution explicitly divorced from any other system. The part of play that operates without engaging formal mechanics in a game that has them available as needed is different, to my mind.<br/>
<br/>
All I wanted to say was that as far as I could tell, Dogs totally allows for that kind of play, as long as everybody's comfy with not scene-framing/driving play directly at conflict-conflict-conflict. My own taste Dogs-wise is more in tune with JBR's, but I can see why someone who's got different ways of approaching the fiction might want to do it differently.                        </div>

<p>I'd call it "free play" because that's what it felt like in my experience, but anyway...</p>
<p>Yeah, I know what you mean, and I think so far I've tended to go for a lot less of that in my games. A lot of free play in my experiences have been a bit undirected, with a bit too much spinning the wheels; in part, there wasn't a really good space to step in and have some pure freeplay going on. (I'm thinking of various  indie and WW games here.)</p>
<p>I think I'd actully like some more free play in some of my games, but to be done right, I think there needs to be a good seed for the free play to happen, and some stuff that the free play can be "about", even if indirectly and implicitly. So in this way the free play in the BitV game was really cool. Brand put the characters in the middle of a situation where they had a lot to talk about IC, and the "about" part was there too - all the stuff about relationships was important to the game and being represented in the course of the conversations.</p>

<p>Now that I think of it, I really enjoyed a bit of free play in my first DitV game where I had the players... judge a baking contest. No, seriously. I wanted them to really get absorbed into the nearly alien wholesomeness of this community and meet the various characters (and their children's baking experiments). The baking contest let the characters start figuring out a little bit of their personality, and also set the stage for when the baking contest Went Terribly Wrong.</p>

                            Mark,<br/><br/>While this is true, my experience with such scenes in actual play is that there's no real fight to get what you want.  Rather, you play the scene out pretty organically, and then at the end you look back at it and evaluate it.  Also, sense all interludes have to be evaluated it's not a case of win/lose really.<br/><br/>So, the scenes feel very much like free-play scenes in other games (at least to me), but with a touch more overt direction.  Does that match up with your experience?<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

<p>Nancy, I'd have suggested a term if I'd thought of one(: I'll put some more energy into it, of course.</p>
<p>But putting terminology aside, yes, by your definition, that play is <em>pivotal</em> to my playstyle, for the reason Graham cites - I have historically needed that kind of stuff to invest satisfyingly in a character. (JBR's Agora makes me think that there's something else in there, that happens to be drawn out by this play but isn't wedded inseparably to it, but that's not completely related.)</p>
<p>But, JBR, speaking of you --<br/>
Is there something important about the difference between games where you wander and those where you don't, or is it too complex to generalise about?</p>

                            My wife and I play in online chat environments, she very extensively. We used to call that "freeform" play because it doesn't use any karma or fortune mechanics, and to people who don't do RPG theory, the word "freeform" describes that very well.<br/>
<br/>
So, we both enjoy play that way. In fact, she enjoys just putting two or more characters together and seeing where that leads. However, there needs to be a "spark" there after a while, or it gets dull. That spark could be anything from an exterior conflict, to an inter-PC one, to sexual tension, to emotional revelations.                        </div>

                            Judson is spot on, I think.<br/>
<br/>
The term 'freeform' feels quite natural here because traditional play's sense of "character ownership" lines up with exploration of character in a way which gives players a sense of freedom that they may not feel when participating in parts of the game where the GM is traditionally authoritative.<br/>
<br/>
(In games like PTA, where players have a massive amount of authority over setting and situation and color - 'freeform' may feel like it applies to a much larger part of the game than it does in the example Nancy provided.)<br/>
<br/>
In my experience, such scenes come about because people are in the mood for an "exploration changeup" -- enough previous play hasn't contained enough exploration in certain areas, which then get attention.  In particular, if a certain kind of exploration has been outright neglected, I find that we sometimes get whole scenes where those elements are featured to nearly the exclusion of everything else.<br/>

                            Shreyas, I think it's sort of a premise thing.  The 'default premise' of roleplaying games, if you'll all allow me a massive overgeneralization, is knocking about, seeing cool things, and wreaking havoc to the situation you're presented with.  That's at least been my experience with 90% of the games I played prior to discovering indie stuff.  And stakesless, unstructured roleplay forwards that sort of play.<br/>
<br/>
Most of my play since finding indie stuff -- and a kind of play that I really, really enjoy -- defines a strong premise and then supports it with rules that hit that premise.  Power-19 sort of design.  Now, "free play" very well may forward that strong premise, but it's not play that is structured by those targeted rules.  As such, it's sort of outside the rules in these games that depend on pretty strict adherence to the rules they present.                        </div>

                            I've been meaning and meaning to say: Nancy, I like to play that way too, and I think there's plenty of room for it in Dogs.<br/>
<br/>
I figure every group is going to come to its own decisions, based on its own taste, about how much non-town play they have in their game. <br/>
<br/>
I also figure that a GM sitting and watching two Dogs having a funny conversation over the stew pot is doing a better job at "say yes or roll dice" than one who cuts them off abruptly to get on to the next town. She's saying yes.<br/>
<br/>
The point of the "drive play toward conflict" GMing rule is to keep GMs from blocking conflict, not to make them play so bam-bam-bam that nobody gets real characters.                        </div>

<blockquote>So I was wondering, do you like freeform play? Why? Why not? Do you want to freeform play even when the system isn't set up for it (like in Dogs where you have to specify you want it, otherwise play is centred around towns and their conflicts)? Do you prefer to RP within conflicts rather than outside of them?</blockquote>
I like it and I think we're using it pretty extensively (I like to use term "social roleplay" for it, since freeform is such a loaded term). I'd guess it has to do with character ownership and playstyle preferences; we like to set up things before hand (pre-written character backgrounds, pre-designed situtations, perhaps plots), start the game, and see what happens. Players take in parameters for characters, build their characters around them, and let it roll.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if this is actually "freeform"; there can be lot of structuring done beforehand - like pre-written characters, pre-defined situtation, even shamelessly pre-defined plots - but when playing starts, players can pretty much do what they want with their characters and gamemaster usually only responds to this. Personally, I think it's very much a live-roleplaying approach borrowed and brought into tabletop play.                        </div>

                            I love Free Play, it's the tasty meat in the RPG sandwich. Sure the rules bring the bread and make it a sandwich at all, but it's really the free play that keeps me coming back.                        </div>

                            As the GM of the game Nancy originally referenced, I'd like to make an observation or two about the way it happened in that game and why. I am also going to use the terms free play and formal play here, even though I agree with many in this thread that they're loaded terms. Hopefully by the end of the post you'll be clear on how I'm using them here specifically, and if we need to do further refining of vocabulary we can do it afterwards. <br/><br/>First off, I had four of four players in the game who wanted freeplay in order to establish their characters and build a dynamic set of character interactions. All of them, I think, have an F based Character socket into game to one degree or another (KJ, Mo, and Nancy for sure, PJ seems to go there too, though I've talked to her less explicitly about it) and so having an emotional grounding and empathic connection with their character before the character hits crisis is very important for their enjoyment of the crisis. Because of this, they argued, the big turmoil and moral judgment of the towns would mean more to them if they'd had a chance to make their characters people before they judged their characters as people. I let them have what they wanted, because they seemed sure it was really what they wanted. This is pretty much my standard GM praxis: give the players what they want. <br/><br/>Second, there is a single very notable differentiation between free and formal play in that game that can be pretty clearly delimited. When we are playing conflict driven play I am the GM and I push shit and move the game from conflict to conflict pretty relentlessly. When we are in free play, I am not the GM anymore. I have said, every time we've done extended free play scenes, "Okay, now I'm not the GM, y'all are in charge and can do whatever you want. If you want me to frame something for you, tell me and I'll do so, but other than that, you ladies are running the show." So you can tell that the play in those scenes is different than the play in the other kind of scene because in one type there is a GM authority and in the other there isn't. At all. <br/><br/>Now, part of the reason for that is because of the structure and medium of the game. It isn't that this is necessary to all free play or anything like that, it happened because we were playing on a MUSH with time constraints, and after the initiation challenges we'd fill out the remainder of the time we had to play with some free play to explore the character's growing relationships in temple. So while the desire to establish character through unformalized play was there, the exact ways it played out was due to a combination of personality and medium, and not something essentialist to the divide. <br/><br/>I also found it interesting that none of the players abused, tried to abused, or even (as far as I could tell) even considered that they could abuse their power in the free play where I was not the GM. They could have all gone and dunked Brother Kishkumen (their hard-ass trainer) in the river, and as I wasn't the GM authority I couldn't really have stopped them. But they didn't, and they didn't want to, because (I think) they are all as committed to the game and its tone as I am. <br/><br/>Throughout the game when someone has asked me "Could I use this trait in this situation" I have replied "Don't ask me, if you think it fits, it probably does. If you want to ask anyone, ask the rest of the group." Now, there have been times when someone has used a trait that left me scratching my head, but when I'd stop to look at it and figure out what they were saying with it, it always made sense in the end. I like that, it gives me space to figure out the tick-tock of the PCs. <br/><br/>Those points together have really confirmed something I've been noticing for the last while in my RP (which has included several GMless games to further the decision): the whole idea that we need a GM as authority to keep the tone and meaning of a game consistent is bunk. Now, having a GM with that authority is essential for some groups and maybe for all groups in some kinds of play. But if you can play hardcore Dogs with the players brutalizing their own characters and not have to use your "GMness" to keep them on the same page, monitor trait usage, or any of that stuff, it really does show that a group that are all committed to each other can easily distribute those GM tasks and make them work without the central authority. <br/><br/>Which brings us right up to the edge of freeplay GMless play, which all those dirty hippies have been talking about for some long time now, but that's taking us off topic and so I'm going to stop here.                        </div>

                            Well said, Brand!  And you're right that we didn't abuse the game or the world; we're trying to figure out who our characters are <i>within</i> that framework.  We socket through our characters and so need to figure out who they are <i>as a result of their world</i> as well as in spite of it.  That being said, one way I settle into a character is I have a general idea of what they are like and also a set of behaviors based on social constraints (and the violation thereof, sometimes).  Then I figure out the particulars from there, through freeform play.  My favourite characters are the ones I had the chance to do this with, and it takes longer when the system (and the GM) doesn't support that kind of play, but it can happen.  It is nonetheless and integral part of play and one I wouldn't do without.<br/><br/>--Nancy                        </div>
