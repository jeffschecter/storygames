In fact it lead later to a discussion with Ron, and then in the car back to Milwaukee with John above, and Thor Olavsrud as well. <br>\n<br>\nI don't want to get too much into the specific issue in question, but I had noted in a recent thread how Ralph had stated how it was that BRS required narration so that you could use the mechanics. And I'll simply say that I'm not sure that it does require narration. I think he may be being hopeful. Anyhow, I may try to tackle this issue elsewhere. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, that said, my problem here is highly theoretical. That is the play was a ton of fun, and, what's more, we narrated like demons. But what's interesting is that the game is a pretty fascinating tactical excercize. One, in fact, that was intense enough that one got the feeling that one was doing it badly. It was definitely a "learning game." And, it seeming to be intentionally competitive as a design, to me this seems like it was a really good thing. I like a learning curve on such games. Especially as all players will be on it at the same time, so you're not getting hosed by not knowing it at some particular level. We all made big mistakes. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut the point is that given that it's so strongly gamism based, and the rules are somewhat general, narration may be sorta ancillary. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy biggest compliment here is that I couldn't find anything troubling in the rules in terms of obvious optimal strategies or the like. It seems like a good game on that level. That said, I'm sorta suspicious of the rules as they stand... I have an intuition that there might be an optimal strategy. Ralph was aware of one, for instance, regarding the yellow dice, that he was working on correcting potentially. What I'd be worried about is that there might be as yet unseen strategies that win out every time, and that's trouble. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not a good enough game theory mathmatician to predict this (I don't even know how hard it would be), but I wonder if that's a rout that can be used in this case to see if it's OK. If not, then all one can do is playtest, playtest, playtest. <br/>\n<br/>\nWith a game where the player stakes are not really well spelled out, and it's not distinctly competitive, I think you can get away with some "slop" as it were in terms of whether or not the game is free from degenerate strategies. But BRS is not such a game. One player wins, and, maybe more telling, one player is the loser. Each has repercussions on the next game you play. So it's clearly designed to promote an attitude to play to win. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, another thing that Ralph has working for him is that the game is set up so that one player will have problems dealing with any other player... the main strategy is to gang up on other players. So, that said, a lot of balance issues will sorta work themselves out due to this. <br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, I think he's got it by the throat here, and that the tactics are very fun. I loved stomping on people with my expensive purple D10s (indicating sorcery). <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the POV of other mechanics, there were times where it seemed that the order of things was not clear. Most important to everybody was "when do I get to buy new dice?" Timing on this is critical, and there didn't seem to be any clear rule on it, other than I'm pretty sure you couldn't do it during a round. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRelated to the question of narration above, too, it seemed like there were only two actions that a player could take:<br/>\n1) Go get your goal from whomever is in the way. <br/>\n2) Separate your opponent's dice pool. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem with each is that (and this seems similar to the problem I had with IAWA), that if you accomplish these things, they can be undone trivially easily. The "Chronicler" role, when played, can do most anything, and can undo any result that separated your dice pool. Except.. well the rule is that a player can stop the Chronicler from doing anything by going to dice, saying, "That was not how it happened!" Meaning that any attempt to go to get your dice back as a third option is going to likely get blocked by the player who took them away (after all, you're now weaker, the reason he took them away, and he was able to win when you were stronger, so you're going to lose big now, right?) <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, in any case, if you go to dice, then your turn as Chronicler is over. So even if you get aid from another player, at best you're getting back to square one by getting your dice back. When you and any theoretical partner could simply make move 1 above, and go get your goal. <br/>\n<br/>\nContinued...                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_139809">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139809/#Comment_139809" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-15T13:13:43+00:00" title="April 15, 2008  1:13PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From above...<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically the rewards for the actions you can take are not well enumerated or varied enough. That is, there may be more to it than this, but I couldn't see what the other options were. <br/>\n<br/>\nExcept that you can do something that is neither getting dice or your goal, I suppose. But the problem is that in such a competitive game, I'm not sure what the use of these would be. Ralph calls it "positioning" and I think that it refers to the idea that a win means you can use some abilities you might not have been able to use before. But it seems that if you're creative you probably can get away with using any ability in any situation. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a "Challenge Rule" in the game (simplified version of that Universalis game, sheesh), which could be used to prevent "abuse"... but that seems like a potential conflict of interest. And, the way the rules work, all you have to do is have one confederate, and you will always win challenges. So, again, strategy number one, get a confederate. <br/>\n<br/>\nSans "appropriateness" being enforcable, practically, "positioning" comes down only to creating a situation where if the opponent loses, he loses dice. So, while your tactical decisions in pushing dice around are intense, your strategic decisions seem extremely limited. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, this is all how it seems from one play, and I may well not be seeing something. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne rules question, and a couple of suggestions:<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen do you spend RP that you won in conflicts on buying new dice? Can you do it immediately? If so, why is there a separate box on the sheet? Why not keep them all in the same box? If they can't be spent immediately, and this is a holding pool waiting for the next chapter, that makes more sense. It would also mean that winning wouldn't have the double reward of not only making your opponent weaker, but making you stronger (it's important that attacking is likely to harm the attacker, too; it's all one big Mexican Standoff to start). At least in the short term. <br/>\n<br/>\nIs that how it works? <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that you need "character sheets" for each thing. That is, it would be cool to have a sheet for each component that the player has that contains all of the dice assigned to it, and the RP left to it, etc. This way you get a real feel for what dice are coming from what, and what'll happen if positioning results in a die pool being separated off. More importantly, it indicates what dice are lost if the associated white "hit points" dice are lost. <br/>\n<br/>\nThen you leave the sheet you had to be each player's "battle mat." <br/>\n<br/>\nThis leads me to think that you might want to allow players to protect assets by not committing them to the battle mat. Rarely is that going to be good strategy, but it would be interesting if you could engineer things so that this was the case. The idea being that dice can only be lost from assets committed. You could "Screen" in some cases this way (leading to creation of small screening components meant to be sacrificed, which might balance the propensity that we noted for players to build the largest components possible). <br/>\n<br/>\nThe "Battle Mat" should have a flow-chart on it that describes things like the precedence order of dice colors in resolution, and when you can purchase new abilities. That's key to understand if you're to have any chance of playing well. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, given that the colors have so much meaning, and in the name of getting conflicts to go faster... ever considered pushing three dice instead of two? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and one more thing. Yeah, we love lying, sure. But one of my favorite rules is how you can tag a player with a black die once during being Chronicler. Largely the function of this serves to give players an incentive to work with each other, or risk seeing the dice in question used against them. Yes? The problem is that even a D10 didn't seem to be any impediment to players betraying. At every chance my thought was, "That player should defect from his alliance, it's the best move, despite the black dice."<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is in part because black dice have no special power. They are too cool for that..l think you should come up with some nifty power for them. Like they can be added as a third die for free or something. Or, alternatively, you might want to allow the players to negotiate for more dice than just one black one. I mean, why not? If a player is willing to accept more dice, why not let them make that committment? <br/>\n<br/>\nYou could do both.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is all just what occurs to me off the top of my head. The other compliment I can give Ralph is that his game made me think about it and whether or not it's working and how, far more than anything else I played at ForgeCon. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139813">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139813/#Comment_139813" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-15T13:18:55+00:00" title="April 15, 2008  1:18PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The short form of the above is:<br/>\n<br/>\nI like it.

This game needs many people trying to break it to discover if there is an optimal strategy.  So far, honestly, we haven't found it; believe me, we certainly try.  But, when you've had your hands in a project from the beginning, it's easy to have blind spots.<br/><br/>Regarding Challenge:  so far, I've found that this works out well, even with the "get a confederate" emergent property.  In fact, this works out <i>really</i> well as a balancing mechanic, assuming that you have players who are willing to hold and employ grudges.  In other words, it becomes a way of punishing players who get ahead or are "out of favor".  So, factions tend to form at the table.  Don't like it?  Well then, come up with an excuse to attack that person and then do so.  Or, better yet, figure out how to court that person to your side.  Then, you know, maybe you work together or maybe you backstab him.<br/><br/>Like the Owe list, I've found that the dynamic of hero elimination adds a great deal to the game.  Therefore, in a given ordeal, I might want to gain more VPs as a general rule, but I especially want to knock Player X out of the running, but that means supporting Player Y, because they are the only two players who are currently up for hero eligibility.  And so on.<br/><br/>Now I'm babbling, so I'll stop.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_140071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140071/#Comment_140071" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-16T13:31:22+00:00" title="April 16, 2008  1:31PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bump.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm interested in not only Ralph's reaction to my ideas, but also Seth's if he wants to react to them, and also I'd like to hear from others on this.

But what's interesting is that the game is a pretty fascinating tactical excercize. One, in fact, that was intense enough that one got the feeling that one was doing it badly. It was definitely a "learning game." And, it seeming to be intentionally competitive as a design, to me this seems like it was a really good thing. I like a learning curve on such games. Especially as all players will be on it at the same time, so you're not getting hosed by not knowing it at some particular level. We all made big mistakes.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the point is that given that it's so strongly gamism based, and the rules are somewhat general, narration may be sorta ancillary.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nIt is very intentionally competitive, and it is highly influenced by boardgame design, and yeah...it takes a few plays to learn how to build characters and components so they're mechanically effective.  There's lots of potential for inventing specific "signature combos"  that are quite powerful.  There's also lots of potential for counters to those combos and even more potential for designs that just plain suck.  In fact, in the latest playtest both Seth and myself tried some extreme "gamey" tactics with our dice builds and got our butts handed to us in short order.  So the learning curve is definitely there...much like Riddle of Steel in that regard, which is not surprising as I describe the conflict mechanics as Dogs in the Vineyard redone with Riddle of Steel priorities.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the narration, there's a lot of moving parts in the game, its not surprising you didn't see the narration be very key.  I was also trying to rush things quite a bit given we were playing over lunch.  One key part of the game was cut out of the convention run altogether in the interests of time.  Normally the Hero Player isn't present when the scenario gets established, so there's a whole lot more narrative jostling as the they try to figure out exactly what's going on.  That said, the way I describe it is this.  In other games story is what you fight over.  In BRS story is what you fight with.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">My biggest compliment here is that I couldn't find anything troubling in the rules in terms of obvious optimal strategies or the like. It seems like a good game on that level. That said, I'm sorta suspicious of the rules as they stand... I have an intuition that there might be an optimal strategy. Ralph was aware of one, for instance, regarding the yellow dice, that he was working on correcting potentially. What I'd be worried about is that there might be as yet unseen strategies that win out every time, and that's trouble.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not a good enough game theory mathmatician to predict this (I don't even know how hard it would be), but I wonder if that's a rout that can be used in this case to see if it's OK. If not, then all one can do is playtest, playtest, playtest.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nThat's why the game is only going to be an Ashcan at Gencon this year.  So far the rules have proven pretty resilient and the balance of power between the dice has proven pretty robust in that changes (and there've been alot) have been in the form of minor tweaks not completely overturning the core premise.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance recent playtesting has demonstrated that while some sorceries like Soul Taker and Blessed are still quite useful, even if you roll low; others like Soul Forged, and Tormentor are only useful if you roll high.  That doesn't bother me at all, it just makes those sorceries feel that much different.  But it does mean other aspects of them need to be balanced differently.  For instance we decided that the rule that allowed regular Blue dice to cancel Soul Forged sorcery nerfed Soul Forge too much relative to the other sorceries.  An easy change.  Also, I think we finally concluded decisively that the"Double Yellow Combo" (the Yellow power lets you recover used dice instead of discarding them) while not necessarily a game breaker, was more dominant than we'd wanted (partly because it was so obvious and doesn't require much cleverness to pull off).  The current rules are testing only allowing yellow to recover non yellow dice, thereby eliminating the infinite loop effect.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141402">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141402/#Comment_141402" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-26T22:17:11+00:00" title="April 26, 2008 10:17PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Again, I think he's got it by the throat here, and that the tactics are very fun. I loved stomping on people with my expensive purple D10s (indicating sorcery).</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nYeah, despite its rough edges the fact that the session was pretty fun regardless is a really good sign.  That was also my first attempt to teach the game to a new group, and there's alot of stuff to cover.  In most games you can take a "learn as you go" approach, but when you have a competitive game, you really need to know more up front so you can optimize your tactics...yet teach the game at a convention to that level of understanding isn't very practical.  That's going to be an obstacle when running one-shots at cons.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Related to the question of narration above, too, it seemed like there were only two actions that a player could take:<br/>\n1) Go get your goal from whomever is in the way.<br/>\n2) Separate your opponent's dice pool.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem with each is that if you accomplish these things, they can be undone trivially easily.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, in any case, if you go to dice, then your turn as Chronicler is over. So even if you get aid from another player, at best you're getting back to square one by getting your dice back. When you and any theoretical partner could simply make move 1 above, and go get your goal.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nThere's actually alot of things you can do, most of which center around positioning your faction and testing the balance of power.  The factions start all evenly balanced.  The player who goes straight for their goal is most likely to wind up with a bloody nose to show for it.  The situation is, by design, very Diplomacy-esque.  Players are too equal (especially once they've acheived some mechanical expertise) for any one person to go it alone, so you need alliances of convenience.  But you also need to maneuver (through narration) to get the advantageous match-ups so that when you do hit a Conflict you're actually able to accomplish something.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the same time, obtaining your goal is only one way of earning Victory Points.  Damaging your opponents can earn you as much or more.  Sometimes the faction that you are "naturally" aligned with in terms of your respective goals, is also the faction that you're best positioned to beat the snot out of.  Can they really trust you not to give in to that temptation?  There's a lot that can be done through narrative positioning that was barely even touched upon in that session.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, we have made a couple of changes already that probably would have made a difference to that session.  One is the rule that anything that was established by winning Stakes in a Conflict can only be undone by Stakes in a Conflict until that Chronicler's next turn as Chronicler.  That would have dealt handilly with the issue of you being seperated from your pet monster by Dave.  Also, the Challenge mechanic has been modified to be a bit more of a vote...one person challenges by standing, everyone who agrees with the challenge also stands.  More testing is needed but in the one session we've played using this change, it did serve to break up the "two headed player" effect.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141403/#Comment_141403" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-26T22:34:01+00:00" title="April 26, 2008 10:34PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 26, 2008 10:46PM by Valamir.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">So I found this game fucking fascinating...

You can bring any of your Traits into the narration at any time without needing to match them to the specific dice being used.

Narrative Consequences is any statement that put limts around future narration.  Mechanincal Consequences are anything that actually impacts the record sheet.   This actually toches on what I said above about there being alot of things to teach in the game and it being difficult to teach as-you-go during play.  There's an entire chapter in the book on positioning and consequences.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne change I've made since FMW is that I've eliminated the ability to inflict Mechanical Consequence when advancing an attack.  Now the only ways to alter an opponents record sheet are 1) when the Chronicler declares such consequences as part of their narration -- which if accepted make you immune to additional such consequences for the rest of the Chronicler's turn -- and if not accepted lead to Challenge or Conflict, 2) as the Stakes of a Conflict...often as the result of refusing to just accept them as it <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, or 3) Long Term Damage rolled during a Conflict.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">I am convinced the game needs to be packaged with a starting scenario that comes with a cloth map and a figure representing a Conan-esque hero.</div>\n</blockquote>\nThat would be pretty cool.

Giving an extra die to your opponent that they can use to eat damage so it doesn't harm their character (and which they can keep using in every Conflict where it applies) is really a pretty useful thing.  That said, I did implement one change, that being that you can't score points for damaging Black Dice.  So if you gave that Black d10 to Mike and then managed to nail him for some damage that would earn you points...but he eats your attack using your own Black Dice...you don't get those points.

I mean if it's in my self-interest, I'll have things about the scene that I'll want to reveal. Is that allowed? It might be fascinating to have a "Nobody is allowed to speak but the Narrator" rule. Hard and fast, no penalty for a foul, you're just cheating if you say anything. <br>\n<br>\nDoes the Hero Player know what the factions are, at least? Or do they start unknown to him as well? That would make bringing back a faction an interesting choice. If you had "development" for factions, then that would incentivize bringing them back. While the fact that they are a more known quantity might make players want to bring in fresh factions. <br>\n<br>\nJust what is "Hidden Knowledge" for this game? Having some, and better yet, rules for discerning what the opponent has, might make for even more intense strategy. And it makes sense in the context of factions. I'm seeing players revealing dice as they roll them. Perhaps they have to announce when they're buying dice, but now how many, or what type. Or players could set up spying on other factions to learn this information. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI like your solution to the yellow dice problem. I think that they're still strong, but now not overpowering. Elves have lots of yellow dice... What.. no elves? <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nPositioning... you keep using this term. And now with your rule that stuff can't be countermanded in the next cycle, I'm starting to see it more. GM decides if an action counts as countermanding previous chronicler declaration? <br>\n<br>\nFor instance, if I chronicle (is that verbable?) that my faction builds a roadblock, and then you chronicle that the hero goes through the mountains to get where he's going, instead of taking the road, has anything been countermanded? Does this require a fight? Are cases of illegal circumvention decided by challenge? <br>\n<br>\nJust as with "Rubber-banding" there's always a wah to chronicle your way past any "position." It seems to me that player intent is important here. Yes? If I set up a roadblock, and you narrate going around it, you've voided my positioning attempt using player knowledge. Is that kosher? You've voided my intent for the positioning, to stop you from getting where we believe you want to get with your character. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI'm interested in the new "Voting" method for challenges. Would it be more elegant if people can keep standing and vetoing the last guy standing (don't count votes, last vote is the only one that counts)? What I worry about with the conflict of interest is that players might develop a strategy where they simply veto by group everything the chronicler says that might give him the slightest advantage. Is that the intent? To keep the Chronicler balanced? So he has to pander to two of the three other players to get anything done?<br>\n<br>\nWere we playing too nice, and not challenging anything that was advantageous? What this would lead to is, I think, a player challenging every time, before going to dice (unless he prefers to go to dice). Are challenges meant to be a normal part of play? Or preventative, and rarely used? <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nYeah, what Keith probably didn't get is that it was just my own strange predilections that had me demanding that people narrate in the linked ability to each die as used. Like you say, use it if you like (I do), but ignore it if you don't like. That said...<br>\n<br>\nSince the narration has no mechanical effect, it's really not an enforcable thing to make somebody narrate to the die color. Sure, somebody could challenge (yes?) if I, say, fail to narrate at all; but why would they bother? Actually I can see players doing it just to make the other players jump through hoops entertainingly, sure, but if the narration had a mechanical effect, then there'd be real incentive to enforce narration done well. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nContinued...                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141473">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141473/#Comment_141473" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-28T07:17:52+00:00" title="April 28, 2008  7:17AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 28, 2008 7:22AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From above...<br>\n<br>\nJust a brainstorm here, and one that might make things more complicated (which I always like), but what if narration in or out of conflict could somehow establish "Situation Dice" which could be rolled into appropriate conflicts? I'm also thinking that there's some milage in setting up situations in which only certain colors of dice can be used. Anti-magic zones to prevent purple from use, secure zones that prevent green dice from being used, restraints to prevent yellow dice use. etc, etc. <br>\n<br>\nMechanical consequences of "positioning" that make it so that narration has to justify their production. In a way this is just an extension of the black dice rule. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nBasically what I'm feeling is that "Narrative Consequences" are unenforceable. So I'm trying to make all narration become a "Mechanical Consequence" of some sort. Meaning it would have to be challenged on the spot (or something like that), to determine if the connection between the two was valid. I may have to do a thread on this alone. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nHere's my best suggestion of all. I like where you're going with the black dice. But you didn't take it to it's logical conclusion. If I give you a black d10, and then I use it in a conflcit, and then I choose to lose that die due to damage you've done.... then I've damaged you by taking one of your dice. Not only do you not get a victory point, *I* get a victory point. <br>\n<br>\nNow *that* has teeth. If I accept a black die from you, then I'm giving you a hostage. It says, "If we fight, and I hurt you, the first thing that happens is you will slay my hostage, and you get a point for that."<br>\n<br/>\nWhich seems thematically appropriate as well. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I still think that a player should be able to try to put on as many dice as they wish. The other player will know the mechanics, and will decide on how many is OK. If you try to push too many, you will simply get blocked. So it's self-limiting. Why have a rule that sets a limit? If a player wants to commit by accepting 5d10 black, why not let him do that to himself? <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141481">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141481/#Comment_141481" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-28T09:57:06+00:00" title="April 28, 2008  9:57AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Anti-magic zones to prevent purple from use, secure zones that prevent green dice from being used, restraints to prevent yellow dice use. etc, etc.<br/><br/>Mechanical consequences of "positioning" that make it so that narration has to justify their production.

Either that, or I am. <br/><br/>"We're in an anti-magical zone" is a narrative positioning that voids use of all magic, even if it's a magical ability that DOESN'T make use of purple dice (something that *seems* like it should be possible) <br/><br/>"You're tied up" is a narrative positioning that voids use of various physical traits, regardless of whether or not they use yellow dice. <br/><br/>In either case, you'd have to address the narrative positioning before you could overcome it. You'd have to leave the anti-magical zone, or free yourself from the restraints. You would have to use the power available to you, either by backing it up with dice in a conflict, challenging, or negotiating with whoever has narrative power at that point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141543/#Comment_141543" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-28T17:59:29+00:00" title="April 28, 2008  5:59PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Great stuff!<br/>\n<br/>\nOK, the Hero Player is not present for framing... are the other players allowed to tell him things? I mean if it's in my self-interest, I'll have things about the scene that I'll want to reveal. Is that allowed? It might be fascinating to have a "Nobody is allowed to speak but the Narrator" rule. Hard and fast, no penalty for a foul, you're just cheating if you say anything.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nCorrect on all accounts.  Player are forbidden from telling the Hero Player anything "out of character"...no penalty, but it is cheating.  This also ties into the rule called Directed Questioning, which anyone can use but is particularly valuable for the Hero.  That's also part of the role for the Map to give the Hero Player some initial framework to go on.  The HP sees "The Caves of Insanity" on the Map and when they're the Chronicler they say things like "I travel up into the hills, where I discover a cave...tell me about it"  and then whatever player owns the cave says what's there and such.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Does the Hero Player know what the factions are, at least? Or do they start unknown to him as well?</div>\n</blockquote>\nNot specifically.  Most Faction "names" are only meta labels anyway.  For instance the Faction might be "Convent of Warrior Monk Blessed".  In game the player might introduce themselves as "We are The White, We are here to purge the land of evil, I am known as The Faithful Rock"  The map might have a location called "camp of The White" but that would be the only initial indication.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Just what is "Hidden Knowledge" for this game? Having some, and better yet, rules for discerning what the opponent has, might make for even more intense strategy. And it makes sense in the context of factions. I'm seeing players revealing dice as they roll them. Perhaps they have to announce when they're buying dice, but now how many, or what type. Or players could set up spying on other factions to learn this information.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nDice are not hidden knowledge once a Conflict begins.  When you commit dice you have to announce what the Trait is and what the die is.  The dice combos are far more interesting when you see what you're up against.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Positioning... you keep using this term. And now with your rule that stuff can't be countermanded in the next cycle, I'm starting to see it more. GM decides if an action counts as countermanding previous chronicler declaration?</div>\n</blockquote>\nNo GM.  The group as a whole acts as the gatekeeper for that via the Challenge mechanic.  But yes, that's how it works.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">For instance, if I chronicle (is that verbable?) that my faction builds a roadblock, and then you chronicle that the hero goes through the mountains to get where he's going, instead of taking the road, has anything been countermanded? Does this require a fight? Are cases of illegal circumvention decided by challenge?</div>\n</blockquote>\nNot as you've stated.  But if when you were chronicler you established that the mountains are impassible and there's no way through them except via the road, and THEN you put a road block there, then you'd have grounds to Challenge if the hero just went passed.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut more commonly you position to justify what YOU are about to do more than trying to limit what others are doing (though that's possible too).  As Chronicler you don't have to wait for the hero to decide to go down the road and encounter your roadblock, you just say that's what happens.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Were we playing too nice, and not challenging anything that was advantageous? What this would lead to is, I think, a player challenging every time, before going to dice (unless he prefers to go to dice). Are challenges meant to be a normal part of play? Or preventative, and rarely used?</div>\n</blockquote>\nThe rules for Challenge specifically require Challenge to be used for purposes of preserving the integrity of the story and game experience.  Using Challenge just to gain mechanical advantage is specifically identified as "unsportsmanlike conduct".<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Since the narration has no mechanical effect, it's really not an enforcable thing to make somebody narrate to the die color. Sure, somebody could challenge (yes?) if I, say, fail to narrate at all; but why would they bother? Actually I can see players doing it just to make the other players jump through hoops entertainingly, sure, but if the narration had a mechanical effect, then there'd be real incentive to enforce narration done well.</div>\n</blockquote>\nThere are times when the intensity of the mechanical conflict is enough that players are like "screw narrating, just show me what your dice are".  There are other times where advancing dice without narrating is boring.  I think groups can pretty much decide for themselves where that line is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141544">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141544/#Comment_141544" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-28T18:04:03+00:00" title="April 28, 2008  6:04PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 28, 2008 6:13PM by Valamir.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText"><br/>\nJust a brainstorm here, and one that might make things more complicated (which I always like), but what if narration in or out of conflict could somehow establish "Situation Dice" which could be rolled into appropriate conflicts? I'm also thinking that there's some milage in setting up situations in which only certain colors of dice can be used. Anti-magic zones to prevent purple from use, secure zones that prevent green dice from being used, restraints to prevent yellow dice use. etc, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nMechanical consequences of "positioning" that make it so that narration has to justify their production. In a way this is just an extension of the black dice rule.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nThat is how it works now.  Not the "Situation Dice" part, but the positioning to establish specific situations where certain Traits are applicable and other's aren't.  I haven't seen anyone specifically try to bad all dice of a certain color, but that might be interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nWolfe has it right.  If I've established an "anti-magic zone" and I've narrated your sorcerer into it, then when we fight I'm going to Challenge any attempt by you to use your Sorcery.  Narrative Position in a conflict happens when dice are advanced.  You as the Sorcerer narrated dispelling my anti magic zone with your powerz when you advance your dice.  If I block you, nope...zone still intact...if you manage to damage me (which you should have a pretty good idea of whether that's going to happen based on the dice you see I have) then the zone is down.<br/>\n<br/>\nPossibly more likely, however, is that you are going to confront the narration that puts you in that location to begin with.  I narrate "The Sorcerer arrives at the Crossroads" (where I set up the zone) you say "Nope, That's not how it happened"  NOW we go to dice where the stakes are whether you go to the crossroads.  If I win...then you go to the cross roads...and you can't narrate yourself OUT of the crossroads until my next turn as Chronicler or unless there's a Conflict about that (the new "what's tied by stakes can only be undone by stakes, or after a full cycle" rule).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd THAT'S why the lead up narration and accumulated positioning throughout the previous scenes (things I established in the back and forth roleplay even when I wasn't the Chronicler) all comes in.  If its already been established that you absolutely intend / need to travel this road, then when I narrate you traveling the road and arriving at the crossroads, I have the weight of that prior Narrative Positioning behind me.  If you say "No, That's not how it happened" and try to take it to dice, I could Challenge saying "Dude, we all totally know your guy is intending to travel this road don't be trying to use your OOC knowledge just to avoid my ambush, that's lame"...and then our fellow players would decided if it is or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nMake sense?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Here's my best suggestion of all. I like where you're going with the black dice. But you didn't take it to it's logical conclusion. If I give you a black d10, and then I use it in a conflcit, and then I choose to lose that die due to damage you've done.... then I've damaged you by taking one of your dice. Not only do you not get a victory point, *I* get a victory point.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nThat's not bad...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141547">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141547/#Comment_141547" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-28T18:28:00+00:00" title="April 28, 2008  6:28PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The one bonus of couch surfing is we have access to cable TV!

And you're agreeing with Ralph.This all boils down to one simple problem. Which is that there's a basic conflict of interests going on. That is, each player is at once a player, dedicated to trying to win the game, and he is also a referee, in terms of his ability to use the challenge. <br>\n<br>\nNow... I have been known to play playground basketball on occasion, which entails calling your own fouls... and I'm tempted to say that this is viable (I certainly have fun with playgound ball). But, frankly? I think I prefer a relatively impartial ref. That is, I don't even trust myself to be fair in calling fouls on myself. So I tend not to call any, as a policy. <br>\n<br>\nBecause there always comes that uncomfortable moment when a player makes a questionable call dealing with a grey area. That's extremely problematic. Fortunately in basketball, these are actually... somewhat rare. I use basketball here because calling fouls is, after calling balls and strikes, the hardest call in sports. There are much more objective calls one can make. <br>\n<br>\nEver try playing baseball calling your own balls and strikes? It's just ludicrous. Cricket solves this problem using the obvious solution, and why we haven't adopted it, I don't know. This is the "mechanical" solution to the problem. <br>\n<br>\nHere's the thing... calls on appropriateness of abilities in a situation are about an order of magnitude more "Grey" than even calling balls and strikes. Example:<br>\n<br>\nOn Ralph's turn, he sets up the roadblock, narrating for about an hour on how the mountains are impassible, and how any attempt to get through will be stopped. <br>\n<br>\nOn my turn, I say that the hero discovers a teleporter, and teleports there. Ralph, in his hour of discussion about how the roadblock can stop me, forgot to mention that the mountains had an anti-magic field over them that would prevent this. Had he done so, I would narrate obtaining a grypon, and flying over. Had he said that there were electro-magnetic clouds that prevent flight, I would have the character tunnel there. Had the stone been impenetrable, I would narrate going around the planet in the opposite direction to get there. <br>\n<br>\n"Gamey?" Do I get called on this?<br>\n<br>\n"Positioning" has to include intent, or it doesn't mean anything. That is, what has to be non-contramandable is that the hero doesn't get where he wants to go. The method is irrellevant. For this to be a valid move in play, it can't be able to be end-run by simple creativity. Otherwise there's no use in making restricting moves. They won't work. <br>\n<br>\nNow, you can challenge me in order to make it stick. But then the criteria is "what's good for the story?" How grey is that? I'd much rather call my own balls and strikes... This is like allowing a judge to rule in cases against themselves. Sure, in theory they have the community good at heart...<br>\n<br>\nNow, what this seems to me to call for is for a ref. That said, I'm not sure I want to be that ref, because you're going to be boooed as the ref even more than Umpires are. At least there's no neccessary conflict of interest, however. <br>\n<br>\nThis seems to me to be a very simple case of incoherence. I'm being told to compete, but then I'm being told to be simmy. Everything must be plausible, because otherwise it'll be challenged. But how do I know that the player challenging me is doing so because it really offends his sensibilities, as opposed to doing it because he doesn't want my move to succeed, so he can win?<br>\n<br>\nWhat I am feeling the need for, as a player, is for rules that say "Do X, roll dice, and player B can't do Y." Sans this sort of mechanical enumeration of action, I'm always going to feel like I'm not really competing. Like I can't go all out. <br>\n<br>\nDoes this, if put into play, tend to make the narration potentially pointless? Yes, indeed. And that's a problem, if you want narration to be integral to play. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nWrap up below...                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141590">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141590/#Comment_141590" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-29T08:53:12+00:00" title="April 29, 2008  8:53AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ... wrapping up.<br>\n<br>\nNote that the below might start to get a bit off topic, but it's context that I think may help with understanding my problem. <br>\n<br>\nThis is the general problem I've been having of late, and BRS has brought it into stark highlight. Is there any way, other than player arbitrariness, to have narration ever have mechanical effects in an RPG? Or, if you put all actions down into certain categories in order to be able to resolve them mechanically, does that obviate the need for narration? It certainly seems to do so in Monopoly. <br>\n<br>\nWhat I'm trying to dig at is the question of why we narrate in competitive RPGs? And the single answer I can come up with is because it affects the mechanics in a way which we expect, and that it does so because some player or GM made a decision that it does. <br/>\n<br/>\nI've argued, in fact, that this is one of those core unique elements of RPGs (not definitional, but part of the genre definition). <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, yes, when we played, we had fun. But when we played, I kept asking certain kinds of questions. And that's because I was constantly under the impression that we might, in fact, be "handwaving" the competition in a way. I wasn't 100% comfortable with being my own ref, or even being the ref in many cases. This is not a theoretical problem, but a real one that occured in actual play. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141611">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141611/#Comment_141611" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-29T12:33:45+00:00" title="April 29, 2008 12:33PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't really buy any of that actually.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect you're imagining more of a problem then there actually is.  It's not a "real" problem that occured in "actual play" because the "actual" play was a couple hours of convention demo where the vast majority of the rules were fast forwarded through so that there'd be an opportunity to actually get something accomplished in the limited time available.  The lesson I learned from that (first time trying to run BRS in a convention environment) is that it was my mistake to try and answer those questions actually.  Since I was serving as facilitator, the better option would have been to say "don't worry about that, this is a con game, just do this and move on".  But of course that approach is counter productive for "play test" play.  I tried to do both, and that made for some rough patches in the game flow.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf players don't give a rats ass about the integrity of the narrative...then they don't.  They'll play for pure mechanical advantage and their story will suck.  And if they're happy with that, fine by me.  If they're not happy with that, I'm giving them the tools to keep that from happening.  If they're not going to use the tools I've given them...I can't make them, no matter what the rules say.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake your example.  I set up the roadblock and you used narration to get around it.  You seem to think that's a problem...that some how I've been cheated...that you've exploited a loop hole...umm...no...that's exactly what you're supposed to do.  There are now only three possibilities:<br/>\n<br/>\na) everyone at the table is like "Oh cool...a teleporter, sweeeet" and we're all excited about this addition to the SIS...an addition that wouldn't have occured if we hadn't been throwing narration back and forth.<br/>\n<br/>\nb) everyone at the table is like "LAAAAAaaaame.  Dude, a teleporter...what the fuck" or "where the fuck did you get a gryphon?" or "tunnel under the mountains...good luck...see you in 1000 years".<br/>\n<br/>\nor<br/>\nc) some combination of the above.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf its a), fantastic...that's the ideal.  You didn't cheat me.  You rose to the occassion...we both "won" in the sense that you avoided the roadblock, and my roadblock successfully forced you to contribute something cool.  Its like in football when you do a trick play to make some big yards.  On the one hand you successfully made some big yards.  On the other hand it was my stifling defense that forced you to resort to trick plays to make those yards.  I made you dig deep and get better...that's also a BIG part of competition.  If I absolutely positively wanted you at the roadblock period and would be satisfied with nothing less...I've already outlined above how I would do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf its b) then the sporting thing for you to do is step back and try something else.  Competition without sportsmanship is ass.  That is in the rules, but I can't force you to demonstrate good sportsmanship.  I can merely tell you that you should and leave it up to you and your group to sort out as they can.  I'm certainly not going to accept the notion that an impartial referee is required to ensure sportsmanlike behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf its c) then that's what the challenge mechanics are for.  Not every time I think something is lame am I going to get my own way and that's how it should be.  But if I'm not even willing to step up and say "hey that's lame"...then the game isn't going to give a shit whether I think it is or not...and that's how it should be too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141612/#Comment_141612" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-29T12:34:19+00:00" title="April 29, 2008 12:34PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Damn these character limits are friggin' annoying.<br/>\n<br/>\nJudging based on story quality is the easiest thing in the world...we do it all the time constantly and so are extremely good at it.  I don't need rules by which you Mike Holmes judge whether you think your contribution is lame, you'll know it as soon as the words come out of your mouth.  I don't need rules by which I Ralph Mazza judge whether your contribution is lame.  I'll know it as soon as the words come out of your mouth.  I don't need rules to enable Dave, and Keith, and Matt, and John to judge whether your contribution is lame.  They'll know it as soon as the words come out of your mouth.  Alls I need rules for what happens when we don't agree because our individual tastes and standard of lameness are different.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut how do we know that I don't think your contribution is lame, just a little bit in part because it inconveniences me or throws a bit of a wrench in my game plan?  We don't, nor do we need to.  Because there's a bunch of other people at the table whose opinion collectively is going to work all that out.  If they think your contribution is lame because its lame and I think its lame because I'm "gaming it"...so what...it was ultimately judged as lame, so even though my judgement may have been biased, over all...lame is lame.  If they think your contribution is just fine, then they're going to call me on it..."dude, he's a sorcerer, of course he can teleport...geeze" and then my lame attempt at being gamey will fail.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow what about the situation where there's a bunch of us all being a little gamey simultaneously?  What if you're in the lead and if you get where your going the lead will be that much greater?  What if your narration is absolutely perfect?  Hell maybe the ability to teleport had already been previously established and I just forgot.  But what if everyone declares your contribution lame anyway just because they don't want you scoring points...well...that's where sportsmanship comes in.  If we all know that your narration was fine and we rejected it for gamey reasons anyway...then we suck.  No amount of rules is going to prevent asshattery.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo let's take a more reasonable situation...where it is totally grey.  Maybe it IS lame...maybe it isn't...but we all have just enough bias to make us say lame...its close enough to being possibly lame that we can call it lame without feeling bad about doing it.  What then?  Friggin Fantastic!  That's a perfectly fine thing and the game handles it just fine, at least it does for longer campaigns.  One shots its a little rougher for the same reason that the Owe List in IaWa is a little rougher in one shots.<br/>\n<br/>\nSee you KNOW going in you're in the lead.  You know going in that everybody is going to be on you.  You know going in that the unfriendly Umpire is probably going to be calling a strike zone the size of Toledo when you step to the plate.  You know that going in and so you adjust your strategy accordingly.  But the other players can't be THAT blatant about it, because in an extended Saga what goes around comes around.  Its much like the game Diplomacy in that regard.  Sure its possible in Diplomacy to totally screw over an opponent in order to snag that one extra Resource Center.  But if you do that on the third turn of the game you've pretty much screwed yourself even more than you screwed the other player.  BRS works the same way.<br/>\n<br/>\nA little bit of "funny business" doesn't hurt...after all "home field advantage" doesn't just mean you have loud fans.  Having too much might be bad, but its typically self preventing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141707/#Comment_141707" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-30T09:37:18+00:00" title="April 30, 2008  9:37AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 30, 2008 9:38AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For argument's sake, what if I as a player have no sense of right and wrong here? I just don't know when enough is enough? You're always telling me that I'm "rubber banding" stuff. Doesn't that mean that I'm pushing the envelope? <br>\n<br>\nBasically, presented with a rule that allows me to do something in a game in which I'm competing, I'm going to do it no matter how "cheesy" another player thinks it is in aesthetic terms. Yes, I know that the other players might not like that, but to me winning is more important than how they feel. So that's how I play. <br>\n<br>\nNow that's not to say that I don't care about how the other players feel. I'm just not going to be the fool who gives them a chance to win because they feel that my aesthetics are somehow inappropriate. What I'd prefer is if the game didn't give me the opportunity to do the cheesy thing. So I can be satisfied that I've played the hardest game I can, and yet still we're all satisfied with the fiction. <br>\n<br>\nWhat happens in real practice, since I'm not an asshat, is that I actually "play along" and don't try to "rubber-band" too much. But then I'm always feeling very uncertain about the limits, and that simply makes play uncomfortable for me. It's simple incoherence. I don't know if I'm supposed to be creating a good story, or playing to win. And I can't prioritize both. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI'm not seeing how your claim to just play nice, no matter how well it's supported by things like challenge structures, is any different than the sort of dysfunctional D&amp;D play we've all seen where the players are told by the rules to kill the baby kobolds, and then we're suprised that they did it. <br>\n<br>\nA while back you and I argued against Tony that the challenge rule in Universalis worked as a way to moderate player disagreements. Tony's point was that it is un-needed because players aren't asshats, and can work those things out for themselves. Our counter - or was it only mine - is that it's quite possible for players to disagree without being asshats. <br>\n<br>\nNow you seem to be claiming that the only way for a player to be disagreed with here is by being an asshat. Sure, you have a challenge rule, but the difference is that in Universalis there's no competition going on (I contend this counter to what you've often said). So there's no conflict of interest in the challenge mechanic. Here there is a distinct conflict of interest, and you're saying that the only way it'll be problematic is if there's asshattery going on. <br>\n<br>\nWell, I felt this problem in play (and I'm not seeing how long-term, better informed play would change this). Maybe I'm an asshat by some definition, that means that BRS is not a game I can play. I just don't see playing to win by the rules as asshattery. <br>\n<br>\nMike<br>\n<br>\nP.S. One thing I completely agree with you regarding: these character limits are friggin' annoying.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141712">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141712/#Comment_141712" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-30T09:55:49+00:00" title="April 30, 2008  9:55AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike,<br><br>I don't see the duality in playing balls-to-the-wall to win, and caring about your fellow players' feelings about your contributions to the fiction.

Yay! It contained <i>The Game Design Reader</i>, a companion to <i>Rules of Play</i>, which is a textbook on game design. Ya'll think that <i>you're</i> design nerds? I have 1500 pages of (semi-)academic writing on the topic that I'm choosing to read. I win! Um, yay, I'm the biggest nerd.<br><br>Hrm.<br><br>Anyways, in that book, I came across an article which seems to be relevant to this thread. And, lo and behold, it's available on the Intarwebs. It's called <a href="http://www.gamepuzzles.com/tlog/tlog2.htm" rel="nofollow">"Unwritten Rules"</a> by Stephen Sniderman. Here's the opening of the article:\n<blockquote><b>Regardless of what game you're playing,<br>you cannot know all the rules.</br></b><br><br>Whether the "game" is tic-tac-toe, chess, baseball, language, etiquette, education, science, religion, law, business, politics or war, the entire set of rules governing the system cannot be spelled out. No matter how hard we try to indicate what is required, allowed, and proscribed, some of the most fundamental principles of playing the game will always elude us. And yet, paradoxically, we can still play the game\u2014some deeper rules are always operating (i.e., affecting the players' behavior) without the players' being aware of them.<br><br/><b>What do we mean by a game?</b><br/><br/>A game is a play activity that consists of an object (a goal or goals that the players are trying to accomplish) and constraints on the players' behavior (what they must do and/or what they may not do in attempting to achieve the game's object). To play a game is to pursue that game's object while adhering (more or less) to its constraints. Some of these constraints (the "recorded rules") are explicitly spelled out and are what we generally understand to be "the rules of the game," but every game is also governed by constraints that are rarely if ever made explicit. Some of these "unrecorded rules" are literally unstatable.<br/><br/><b>An example with Tic-Tac-Toe</b><br/><br/>Suppose I challenge you to a game of tic-tac-toe. Could anything be more straightforward? But just to be sure, we review the rules. We'll play on a 3x3 grid, we'll alternate turns, we'll play only in empty squares, I'll play X's, you play O's, I'll play first, and the first player to get three of his/her symbol in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game. Aren't these all the rules of tic-tac-toe?<br/><br/>Well, for one thing, nothing has been said about time. Is there a time limit between moves? Normally, we both "understand" that there is, and we both "know" that our moves should be made within a "reasonable" time, say 20 seconds. If one of us takes longer, the other starts to fidget or act bored, may even make not-so-subtle comments, and eventually threaten to quit. Without having stated it, we have accepted a tacit time limit. And because we haven't stated it, it is fairly flexible and very functional.<br/></br></br></br></blockquote>\n...continued...                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141725">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141725/#Comment_141725" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-30T10:30:20+00:00" title="April 30, 2008 10:30AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/><b>Is it a rule, or isn't it?</b><br/><br/>Suppose it is my turn and, no matter what I do, you will win on your next move. Couldn't I prevent that from happening, within the rules stated, by simply refusing to play? Nothing in the rules forces me to move within a particular amount of time, so I simply do not make my next move. Haven't I followed the rules and avoided losing? And yet, if you've ever played a game, you know that this strategy is almost never employed and would be completely unacceptable. Anybody who seriously resorted to such a tactic would be considered childish or unsportsmanlike or socially undesirable and would probably not be asked to play in the future. This behavior seems to violate some fundamental but rarely stated principle of the game without any of us ever having to discuss it.<br/><br/><b>Self-defeating rules</b><br/><br/>But can't we state the principle it violates? Can't we just make that principle one of the rules of tic-tac-toe and other games? The answer is\u2014 yes, of course we can, but we will not eliminate the problem. Suppose we add the following rule:  Players will make their moves within a reasonable amount of time. Have we solved anything? What is a "reasonable" amount of time? One minute? Five? 30? A million? And who determines what is reasonable\u2014the player whose turn it is or the other player?<br/><br/>Such a rule is actually self-defeating because it calls attention to the fact that we cannot spell out what "reasonable" means.<br/><br/>So why not just specify a time limit for each move? Because we would just create even more perplexing problems for ourselves. For one thing, we would have to indicate when a player's time is running and when it is not. If one player had to answer the phone, for example, would we count that time or wouldn't we? To state the rule fully, we would have to list every life situation that could possibly interrupt a player's turn and state whether it should count against that player's time limit. Obviously, we could never complete such a list.<br/><br/><b>Practical solutions</b><br/><br/>A far more practical "solution," the one most of us have used all our lives in "friendly" games, is to say nothing about time limits and rely on our opponent's intuitive understanding of a "reasonable" time for a move and his/her desire to keep the game moving and therefore enjoyable. In other words, we depend on unstated\u2014and probably unstatable\u2014"rules" (really just expectations) when we play a game for fun.<br/><br/>In tournament or professional games, of course, we cannot leave things so loose, and various methods have been employed to solve the time dilemma. Generally, specific time limits are spelled out, as are specific penalties, including forfeit, for exceeding them. Official devices are employed for timing moves\u2014chess clocks, the shot-clock in college and pro basketball, stopwatches in baseball games and tennis tournaments, and so on. But once we move beyond "reasonable" to "official" time, we create a whole new set of problems, problems that can no longer be solved with a simple agreement between or among players.</blockquote>\nThe article goes on from there, and I'll cop to not having finished it.

There's something in your own best interest but doing so would upset people who are important to you, so you have to wrestle between those two priorities and that makes you uncomfortable.  I'm not going to be able to help with you that one.  To me...that's just fundamental people interaction every single day of your life kind of stuff.  And yes, I do I expect you to be able to bring those skills into your games as well, and yes I do rely on people using those skills as part of my game design.  To tell the truth when I try to think about what a game would look like that didn't require those skills, I'm fairly certain it would be a game I wouldn't want to play.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">I'm not seeing how your claim to just play nice, no matter how well it's supported by things like challenge structures, is any different than the sort of dysfunctional D&amp;D; play we've all seen where the players are told by the rules to kill the baby kobolds, and then we're suprised that they did it.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nAre we surprised?  What would surprise me is if someone at the table made it clear that they would be seriously bothered by the slaughter of helpless baby kobolds and you went ahead and did it anyway...and then tried to hide behind the "if we weren't supposed to kill them they wouldn't be worth XPs" excuse.  If nobody has such a problem, and you do it, then fine.  But if someone does and you do it, then what...In D&amp;D; you have social pressures and GM fiat to handle such disagreements.  Often that works quite well, sometimes not so much.  The only things Challenge Mechanics do...whether in Universalis or Blood Red Sands, or Dirty Secrets, is 1) explicitly make it clear when its the other persons responsibility to speak up and not expect everyone else to read their minds, and 2) formalize a process to determine who has to back down.  They make sure that everybody has the opportunity to be heard, but they also make clear that just because you've been heard that doesn't mean you get to have it your way.  The mechanics of the Challenge determines case by case whether your desire for XPs outweighs the other players issues regarding dead babies.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut despite your posturing in this thread, I've played with you enough to know that you'd almost certainly defer to the other player's preference without needing the Challenge Mechanic...as I suspect would most posters here on Story Games.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo near as I can tell what you seem to be saying, and correct me if I get this wrong, is that:  when you're not "competing" you have the full capability and willingness to utilize your adult human social skills...but when you are "competing" you expect to be able to turn off your adult human social skills and "just compete".<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess what I'm saying, is that I expect you to compete with your adult human social skills still turned on...that's my definition of Good Sportsmanship as it pertains to RPGs.  Competition isn't genocidal warfare.  In my view you don't get to turn off basic humanity just because you're playing to "win".  If you can win and still play by the rules that's more impressive than winning by cheating.  And employing basic adult human social interaction skills is part of the rules...most likely best left in the category of unspoken rules in the article Seth linked to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141735">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141735/#Comment_141735" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-30T11:13:12+00:00" title="April 30, 2008 11:13AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 30, 2008 11:17AM by Valamir.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Aarrrght...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Now you seem to be claiming that the only way for a player to be disagreed with here is by being an asshat.

Challenges aren't meant to deal with true asshattery.  Challenges can deal with incidental asshattery of the "oh, crap...sorry guys, didn't realize I was being a jerk, thanks for setting me straight, let's do this other thing instead"...but they can't cope with true asshats.

If you're not...then your not playing by the rules and therefor your "win" is as tainted as if you secretly fudged your dice.  If you're not sure whether you're being a sportsman...then you're probably not.  If you're having debates with yourself about whether you should or shouldn't do something cause it might not be sporting, you probably shouldn't.  But if you do...inadvertantly or intentionally -- the Challenge mechanic is there to let other players voice their opinion on whether you should have or shouldn't have.  They may decide you should, they may decide you shouldn't...either way is a data point for future reference.  I'm really not seeing any incoherence or even real problem here.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only reason I changed the way the Challenge Mechanic worked is not because the idea of Challenges wasn't working, but because the streamlined system I'd adopted didn't give everyone a voice, so it wasn't the right tool for what I was trying to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSeth:  I've had Rules of Play for years...but that otherone I haven't heard of...I shall have to get it now for I cannot allow you to claim the title of bigger nerd for long ;-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141806/#Comment_141806" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-01T07:51:58+00:00" title="May  1, 2008  7:51AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How do I put this? Your argument would have a lot more weight with me if I always had this problem with every game I play. If the problem is actually "just life" then I should feel this issue with every game I come across. But, instead, I only feel it with certain very specific games like BRS. I've never felt it with Universalis, for instance. Or with D&amp;D. Because those games don't set up a conflict of interest. Other games do not have such grey areas of judgment as part of win conditions. <br>\n<br>\nI feel like you'd be arguing that judges shouldn't recuse themselves from iffy cases of law in which they might have an interest, because they should just trust themselves, do the right thing, and not feel uncomfortable about it. With the judge at least you'd be able to argue that it might be a duty. An RPG is entertainment, and I'm feeling no particular obligation to have to be uncomfortable. <br>\n<br>\nNow... maybe I'm just not tough enough for your game. Or sportsmanlike enough. If your response is "get over it" then, oh well, I guess that it's not the game for me, then. I'll find something fun to play. Because I don't think that I'm going to fundamentally change as a person just to accomodate this game.

You may want to wait and reserve judgement until you have a chance to actually read the rules instead of go off a few hours of Con demo before deciding.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I guess here's where I'm having trouble seeing your perspective.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we're talking a CEO balancing doing the right thing vs. making millions of dollars...yeah, I totally agree with you.<br/>\nIf we're talking a professional athlete looking to pad his stats for an upcoming contract negotiation...yeah, I totally agree with you.<br/>\nIf we're talking a judge whose ruling could affect peoples lives and serve as a foundation for future precedent...yeah, I totally agree with you.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut we're not talking any of that.  We're talking engaging in a fun social activity with your friends.  What's at stake if you win? Certainly not millions of dollars or people's lives.  We're talking about winning bragging rights.  We're talking about the fun that comes from being able to smack talk with your crew about how you completely owned them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the prize is bragging rights with your friends, how is it a winning strategy to use gamey tactics to gain a technical "victory" if all your friends think you're a lame-o in the end.  You're not competing over points...you're competing over the respect and admiration of your peers that you'll get from winning the points.  Winning the points but losing the respect and admiration by using cheesy tactics doesn't seem to be a good Game Strategy by any measure.<br/>\n<br/>\nChallenge Mechanics then can be seen as a Face Saving device for you (the generic "you").  They give your peers the ability to sound a warning when you're about to lose respect for your actions so that you can self correct.  That way you can continue to pursue a victory that will leave your friends impressed rather than a faux-victory that leaves your friends disappointed.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts like playing Jungle Speed...when I manage to grab the totem on an All-Grab away from Seth I totally smack talk and strut around...cuz it doesn't happen very often, and when it does I live it up.  But if the reason I was able to beat him to the toem is because I stabbed him in the eye with a fork...that's hardly a victory worth bragging about.  No one's going to be impressed with my mad Jungle Speed Skillz then.  I might have "won" the totem...but I totally lost the game.  So what motivation would I have to use the fork?  None whatsoever, I'm thinking (Seth's breathing a sigh of relief at this point).<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me that's the exact issue we're talking about.  What's my motivation to do something cheezy in BRS?  No one's going to be impressed with my mad Blood Red Sands Skillz if I do the narration equivelent of stabbing everyone in the eye with a fork right?  So I choose not to do that because its not a good game winning strategy for me.  If I can narrate something so awesome that everyone's like "holy cow...that's totally sweet..."  AND I manage to totally own them in the points...well...then I'm the MAN.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's how I sees it anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141852">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141852/#Comment_141852" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-01T10:43:12+00:00" title="May  1, 2008 10:43AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seth, I don't recall. I might have had some objection like this with regards to it, but if I did, I'm not sure I recall where that objection lies. I'd suspect it would be with a small part of one of the sub-systems. Was it with the GM being both opponent and ref? Been too long since I looked at it. Like BRS, BE is mostly concocted of stuff that I admire a great deal. <br>\n<br>\nBRS is not the only game that has had this problem for me, far from it. If you're following along at all with the thread at the Forge on IAWA's resolution system, this is a highly related issue to the one I have with IAWA. And there have been others. <br>\n<br>\nAnd... unlike my ultimatum above may sound, I'm not sure that this problem is a game-breaker for me. What I'm looking for (in both cases) is whether or not the game has some solution that I'm not seeing that works to solve the problem, or if it's something that I would fix in a similar design that I would make. <br>\n<br>\nOne of the real problems is that I think it may be a completely insoluble problem. That being that I want the following in an RPG:<br>\nA) Narration has meaning to how the game plays out. Any "mechanization" of such narration should not tend to make narration unneccessary, but in fact advantageous. <br>\nB) The mechanical meaning of the narration is not arbitrarily assigned by any player, so that there are few grey areas, and no conflicts of interest. There are clear rules to handle any "move." <br>\n<br>\nAgain, as I've said, some part of the problem goes away with an impartial GM. While that role might be uncomfortable to some extent, that might be the price we pay to play. And in any case, for me at least, it's not nearly as uncomfortable as being a player with a conflict of interest. <br>\n<br>\nWhat makes this potentially impossible to solve is that narration can include anything, and so to accomodate that, we usually use "effects first" design. So in Hero System, I can define any attack by using the rules for attack powers. Heck, I've always been a bit turned off the the "special effect" rules that say, "If the nature of the power is one that he GM thinks is appropriate, he can add a few dice to the effect." Too fricken wishy-washy for me. I never used that rule in play, instead making players take the effect and pay for it if they wanted to have it come into effect in play. <br>\n<br>\nIn Hero Quest, you can take an ability called "End the Universe" but if it's only at level 13, your chances to end the universe with it are slim indeed. The mechanical enumeration trumps the in-game description. <br>\n<br>\nThe problem is that as soon as we categorize everything into a certain set of mechanics, the RPG starts to look like a board-game again, and people stop worrying about the details, and instead start thinking mostly in terms of mechanics. Indeed there's no more point to narrating than to entertain, which is no more incentive than one has in a game of Monopoly to narrate out the situation.<br>\n<br>\nThe other option is to either limit what the resolution system resolves (which tends to narrow responses in play accordingly), or to come up with a way to create mechanical effects that deal with every possible in-game action. This leads to the sim monstrosities that we've seen in design, which never really get to the end because there are infinite numbers of things that one could attempt, and as you add more and more mechanical details the game becomes to cumbersome to play. <br>\n<br>\nSo we tend to have effects first, and I find that tends to make me narrate details less. <br>\n<br>\nContinued...                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141853">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141853/#Comment_141853" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-01T10:43:25+00:00" title="May  1, 2008 10:43AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...from above.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nIn general, any system that says, "This way to play is the right way to play" and has a system that supports something else is a problem to me. Or even if it just exhorts instead of giving mechanical support. The Window is the worst for this, it supports nothing in play, and basically asks the players to do what they consider good play all on their own. At best it gets out of the way of that good play. <br>\n<br>\nThat's weak design. I'd rather play freeform than a game that "just gets out of the way" (and I don't like freeform much, either). <br>\n<br>\nBRS's exhortation to "play in a sportsmanlike manner" without anything to back it up mechanically, is doing just this. The question is whether or not the challenge mechanic will get people to play in a sportsmanlike manner. But I'd argue that it only will circularly. If they are sportsmanlike, they'll use it in a sportsmanlike fashion, and you'll get that. But you have to start out sportsmanlike. The system is sitting there begging to be used for mechanical advantage (nobody's denying that it can be used so, just a claim that we're playing wrong if we do), so there's a conflict of interest. Even if everybody is actually acting in a sportsmanlike fashion, you can feel that others are not or, even if you trust everyone, you can worry that your own actions are being percieved as unsportsmanlike. <br/>\n<br/>\nI do. Wheras I don't nearly as much even in basketball. And not a whit when playing D&amp;D. <br/>\n<br/>\nNo, I don't just want a tool that I can use to simply facilitate the sort of play I want. I want an engine that propells me in the direction of play that's functional. It has to make it rewarding to do the right thing. So I can play by the rules and be sure that I'm doing the right thing, whichever choice I make, and that I know that others know I'm making the right choice. Call me lazy for not wanting to worry about it. But that's why I play with one system, and not another. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLet's look at it from another perspective. If my "rubber-banding play" is at all grey, and the rule is "If it's at all grey, it's wrong," then I'm never, ever going to attempt any sort of "positioning" in play, because every such positioning is going to feel grey to me. Leaving me with few sorts of strategic moves.

And I'm hoping that what I'm seeing as a problem is not a problem. You haven't reassured me at all on this here, but, sure, I'm willing to see what the actual rules set does. Not just the text, but in full play. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm also willing to admit that I may well be the only person in the world for whom this is a problem. I doubt it, but it's not impossible. I'm certainly willing to believe that it's not something you have a problem with. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut let's be clear. Do you really think that what makes me unique is that I have no sense of sportsmanship? Not in the theoretical, Ralph, but really. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf I'm not the worst sport in the world, which is how your argument goes, then there has to be some other level of competition at which one could be uncomfortable (that, or I'm lying). Again, I'm not uncomfortable because I think I've been a bad sport. I'm uncomfortable because I don't know if I've played to the best of my ability allowed. Hopefully I've erred on the side of sportsmanship. But, as I say in the last post, I'll probably waaaaay over-err, just to be certain. So much so that I'm pretty much just ignoring the rule. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo let's forget about the "if you only want to win" rhetoric. That's not what I am talking about. And it's a tad insulting because it either means that you think I really am a bad sport, or that I'm making some sort of intellectually dishonest argument to make my point. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141861">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141861/#Comment_141861" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-01T11:50:43+00:00" title="May  1, 2008 11:50AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Mike, I think I was pretty clear above that I think you would never do that sort of thing in play, so I'm not sure where you feel I'm calling you a bad sport.  What I am saying is that its precisely because you're not a bad sport that its not a problem.  You're not going use cheesy tactics because you know they'd be cheesy and not appreciated, I'm not going to, The other players aren't going to...and if any of us forget in the heat of the moment or have somewhat more lenient definitions for what constitutes cheesy -- that's what the challenge mechanics are there to sort out...So yeah...this is me struggleing to even comprehend this problem that you're claiming to have.  Its sounding more and more like a vast "what if" exercise and not anything that's actually likely to happen in play.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do think you're using a good bit of hyberbole in your arguement but I'm not holding that against you because clearly this is an important soap box for you so I'm quite sympathetic when you drift into a bit of hyperbole to make your point because I have a tendency to do that too over things I'm passionate about.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Let's look at it from another perspective. If my "rubber-banding play" is at all grey, and the rule is "If it's at all grey, it's wrong," then I'm never, ever going to attempt any sort of "positioning" in play, because every such positioning is going to feel grey to me. Leaving me with few sorts of strategic moves. Basically attack to take.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nBut that's not the rule at all.  The rule is "try what you like, if someone has a problem with it they can Challenge...if not its all kosher."  If they challenge and lack the support to make it stick, then again its all kosher.  If they challenge and have the support to make it stick, then the foul's been called, the flags been thrown.  But there's no penalty for it.  You just change what you say to something they don't challenge and move on.  Again, its all kosher.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe great think about this is, and this is where I'm having trouble following your problem, is there is no grey.  Its black -- you've been challenged, or its white -- you haven't.  There's never any move that you have to feel bad about because its immediately clear whether it was kosher move or not.  If they don't care enough to stand up and Challenge, then they're saying its kosher and you don't have to worry.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only times when its not kosher are these<br/>\n<br/>\n1) when you do something, no one challenges, but later they come back and say it was bad.  Fuck them, they had their chance to Challenge, they didn't take it...game says at that point whatever you did was kosher by definition and they can take a flying leap.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) when you do something, it is challenged, but instead of abiding by the spirit of the challenge and going in a different direction you come back with essentially the same thing, over and over and over to try and weasel it through.<br/>\n<br/>\nTHAT'S where the game relies on sportsmanship.  In the first case you can't come back after the fact complaining that the refs called a bad game...because you are all collectively refs.  If you didn't make the call when you had the chance its unsporting to cry about it later.  In the second case, well that's just obvious, stop being a weasel.  The exact same rule that applies to every game...including chess.  There's no rule in chess that prevents me from reciting nursery rhymes during your turn, but if it distracts you and you ask me to stop so I switch to reciting multiplication tables instead...I'm a weasel.  Rules can't help with that crap.<br/>\n<br/>\nHelping make the signaling around <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> a little clearer is one benefit of the new rules.  I something, you challenge, all 3 other players stand up with you.  So I change what I say...you're all still standing.  So change what I say again, you're all still standing.  So I keep changing what I say, until at least two of you sit down again.  If I'm being weasely about it, this could take awhile and yes, this is where being sporting comes in.  I KNOW what you're objecting to (because you've told me) I probably know what you'd find acceptable instead (because you've likely told me that also).  Employing normal adult human social skills should get this resolved in no time at all, and the game goes on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141867/#Comment_141867" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-01T12:38:08+00:00" title="May  1, 2008 12:38PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            While, indeed, I'm making a soapbox to stand on of this particular issue, I assure you, 100%, that the phenomenon that I'm talking about is not at all "What if" speculation. Let me be very clear. When we were actually playing, I started asking questions about things like timing and positioning, because I felt the creeping sensation that the rules, in fact, are what you have confirmed they are here. <br>\n<br>\nI can't say honestly that I felt the particular problem using the rules with full understanding. But I was ameliorated in play only by the fact that I didn't understand the rules well. I believe that, if I had, I would have had the same reaction that I had in playing IAWA. Which is a distinct, and very real, sense of discomfort. <br>\n<br>\nI feel strongly enough that I'm likely to feel this way in actual play understanding the real rules that I'm leery of playing the game now. That's not posturing or rhetoric, that's a fact. I want to make it very clear that the problem that I've had with games that I'm percieving are like yours is a very real phenomenon. And while it's not the worst phenomenon that I've encountered playing an RPG or anything, it's enough that I'm here on my soapbox worried about it. <br>\n<br>\nNow as to whether or not I can make you understand the issue... well I've tried. And I don't know that stating it again is going to make it any more understandable. <br>\n<br>\nAs to your notes about how the challenges work... I'd like to say that it's helping... but no. I'm not saying that the game will break down or cease at all. Nor that anyone will get upset with anyone else. I'm saying that I'm going to be ignoring positioning because I'm going to always feel that I might get challenged, and I don't want to be challenged. The criteria for challenge are aesthetic, so anyone could disagree with me at any time (and given my aesthetics, probably will). Worse, I don't want them to feel bad about any other player having to challenge me in a grey area, worried that their challenge is, as well, going to be seen as meritless, or, worse, as them being "gamey". <br>\n<br>\nI don't know why I feel that way, I just do. Maybe I'm just a coward who doesn't want the creativity of my ideas judged. But what it feels like is that there's a conflict of interest that's getting in the way. <br>\n<br>\nMike                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141875">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141875/#Comment_141875" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-01T13:02:18+00:00" title="May  1, 2008  1:02PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">As to your notes about how the challenges work...

Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, the game does fully expect you want to be challenged and to want to challenge others.  I suspect (and this has been born out in our play so far) that, much like Universalis, the ACTUAL occurances of challenge is rare, because, much like a loaded gun, the threat of it proves sufficient.  I say this because the primary driving mechanism of moving the game forward is not the Challenge.  That's just the mechanism for keeping the car on the road, so to speak.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut yes, someone who is unwilling to have their creativity judged or to judge that of others is going to have problems with the game.  I fully accept that.  I enjoy that aspect of play.  I actually see it as a natural extension of kibbitzing and the peanut gallery only more in-your-face about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142048">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142048/#Comment_142048" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-02T13:18:05+00:00" title="May  2, 2008  1:18PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that you've focused on a supposition I've made in an attempt to provide clarity *by discarding it* only because it makes it my fault that the game doesn't work for me.

It means he's got more than one interest that he's supposed to be looking out for, and each interest drives him in a different direction. Such that it becomes difficult to impossible to tell which interest is being served given a particular decision. <br>\n<br>\nIn your game, the player has the interest to win, but he also has the interest to keep the game "aesthetically sound" by challenging things that are somehow out of bounds by his standards. This is a conflict of interest because any decision made to veto another player's offering could be, in fact, a simple attempt to thwart that player, to advance the original player's goal. <br>\n<br>\nGiven an objective way of determining if a particular decision is actually being made on aesthetic grounds, we could know if a player had violated his mandate, and we wouldn't have to worry about any conflict of interest... we could tell if they were "cheating." But given that aesthetics are personal, and vary wildly between individuals, it's very hard to tell if a challenge being made is being made in the name of aesthetics. <br>\n<br>\nWe trust the other players, but if a decision comes up that differs from our own aesthetics, we're prone to wonder about it. Worse, not wanting to put the other player under suspicion, it becomes best not to proffer anything that might get challenged, so as not to place that player in the position of having the conflict of interest in the first place. <br>\n<br>\nNow, if in fact the challenge mechanic is actually just another part of the whole competition, if it's just a mechanic which players use to win, then we don't have a conflict of interest. We understand that if we're challenged, that it's being done because the other player hopes to use it as a tool by which they can win. But in that case, you have a mechanic that won't ever actually get used to support some aesthetic standard. Good entries will be vetoed because they are winning moves. Bad entries will go unchallenged because they don't really represent the side in question being given much real advantage. <br>\n<br/>\nThink if in playing a game like Chess if your opponent could look at a move and say, "The queen would never move herself next to a lowly pawn!" And could veto his opponent's move thus. Would the game be able to progress mechanically? <br/>\n<br/>\nAny such mechanic is stronger than the other mechanics, it trumps them. As such playing that mechanic becomes a dominant strategy, and you quickly get a Nash equilibrium where nobody can advance at all in the game. <br/>\n<br/>\nI suggest that the challenge mechanic, as explained to us, was not being used in competitive manner, but in an aesthetic one. So the game can progress based given that. But the problem then is that we're back to a conflict of interest. Which doesn't have to have actual abuse to be bad, but simply feels bad before you even make the first decision. <br/>\n<br/>\nAny clearer? <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_142428">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142428/#Comment_142428" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-05T10:18:10+00:00" title="May  5, 2008 10:18AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm starting to see your point finally, Mike. <br/><br/>As I'm reading it, playing the Challenge Mechanic as a strategy is viable by the rules; It becomes a dial to be set in the individual groups as to whether or not it's kosher. <br/><br/>Though my understanding of the mechanic is somewhat behind the times (there've been mentions of changes to the text), this dial, ideally, should be set mechanically during play.. It's not like the chess example, because there are only two people playing. In the challenge mechanic, everyone else in the group gets to have their say.. So if I make a move, and you challenge it on gamey reasons, then Ralph and Seth get to chime in. Ralph might agree with you for aesthetic reasons, or he may not want me to take a move that puts me in an advantageous position. Seth might, however he'd like me to lose, decide that he thinks your objection is spurious, and supports my narration. The reasons behind everyone's vote are mechanically valid. Over the course of play, we'll decide which standards are acceptable in our group. <br/><br/>In short, I think that I'm coming to understand your conflict, and if so, I agree it's a valid concern.. But I think (from my limited knowledge of the game) it's a concern that is adequately handled by the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142441">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142441/#Comment_142441" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-05T11:15:49+00:00" title="May  5, 2008 11:15AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just because there are more than two sides, Lance, doesn't mean that there can't be a problem with how the rule is used.

The problem is that it's uncomfortable to play when any decision you make can look like a conflict of interest. Or, even worse, where you may force another player into a situation where you have to judge whether or not they're acting in a way that represents a conflict of interest. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_142450">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142450/#Comment_142450" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-05T11:49:45+00:00" title="May  5, 2008 11:49AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 5, 2008 11:52AM by Valamir.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Mike, very clear.

I had taken that mechanic directly from Dirty Secrets primarily because it was a more streamlined mechanic than the one in Universalis and I didn't want to throw another mechanical subsystem of "bidding" into the game.  But, since in Dirty Secrets there is no motivation to pursue winning, there is no motivation to manipulate the challenge mechanic in that way.  In BRS there definitely is such a motivation and we observed that the Challenge mechanic was being used for "gamey" purposes more then it was for aesthetic purposes.  That original mechanic was what we played with at FMW and it was actually some of the issues that arose in that session that put the final nail in that one and set me looking for an alternative.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was Seth who suggested converting the mechanic to more of a vote structure, which I'd initially resisted on the grounds that a "vote" mechanic wasn't the vibe I wanted for the game.  But in practice so far its seems to be working and the requirement that all challengers must stand does keep the vibe pretty aggressive.   More playtesting is needed to be sure its delivering.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Given an objective way of determining if a particular decision is actually being made on aesthetic grounds, we could know if a player had violated his mandate, and we wouldn't have to worry about any conflict of interest... we could tell if they were "cheating."

Here are my design goals / philosophy with respect to the aesthetic issues.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) The game is entirely uninterested in the personal aesthetics of any individual.  The game is only interested in the collective aesthetic of the group.  If the collective aesthetic can be preserved, then the game will function just fine.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Preserving and enforcing that collective aesthetic is the function of the challenge mechanic.  This was always the function of the challenge mechanic, but the original rules didn't deliver.  The way this works is that one person rises up and expresses their issue.  If sufficient other people rise up in support, then that personal aesthetic becomes adopted into the collective aesthetic.  If not, the the personal aesthetic is discarded in favor of the collective aesthetic that doesn't care about that issue.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142452/#Comment_142452" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-05T11:51:32+00:00" title="May  5, 2008 11:51AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            3) This allows for a good bit of "slop" in the motivation of the original challenger.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the challenger is really just trying to block a good move and the aesthetic isn't really a problem, then the other players can thwart the challenger by simply not supporting their challenge.  The collective has said "nice try...but no".<br/>\n<br/>\nIf on the other hand the challenger is really just trying to block a good move, but can make a reasonable case that its an aesthetic issue, then the other players may support him due to that aesthetic.  If that's the case, then the collective enforced the aesthetic that they desire for the game correctly.  If enforcing that aesthetic just happens to help out the challenger tactically, then that's perfectly fine by the standards of the game.  In fact...its a big part of using the narrative as a weapon.  You are establishing the tone and color and situational details of the game as you play.  If you can then use those details to support your case in a Challenge, and that sways enough people to agree that based on what's been established the current narrative would violate the established aesthetic...and that gives you a tactical edge...then you're playing properly.  This is a key reason why the narration and "roleplaying" are not just unnecessary hold overs.  They actually are a key part of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf finally either 1) the challenger is just trying to block a good move, and the rest of the group know that, but enough of them also want to block the good move and so support the Challenge even when there isn't really an aesthetic grounds for it, or 2) the challenger really does have valid aesthetic grounds for blocking a move, and the rest of the group know that, but enough of them want the move to succeed and so let the Challenge fail...that's ok to.  Its ok because it is the collective aesthetic that is important to the game, and collectively the group has decided, in this instance, to allow tactics to trump story quality.  That's totally appropriate because, hey, we're talking sword and sorcery stories and movies here, and no matter how much we love the genre they aren't exactly "high art".  A certain degree of opaque purple prose and cringe worthy moments can be found in any Howard short story and a certain degree of over the top cheese can be found in any 80s genre movie.  So it doesn't really hurt the integrity of the game to have either of those things crop up.  In a group where story quality is paramount over all other concerns...then presumeably the collective would never make either of the above rulings and are voluntarily saying "win, yes...but win using THESE story conditions or it doesn't count".<br/>\n<br/>\n4) And lastly, if there are occassions where a person's aesthetics were shunted aside in favor of tactical considerations (such as when a winning player finds the group more prone to vote against them), that's part of the game too.  This meta level of play is designed to form a continuous feedback loop with the story.  Unlike some games where the goal is to keep the story completely devoid of meta impact, in BRS the story is driven by it.  In any situation you'll have a number of factions.  Which factions wind up allies and which enemies will be partially informed by how the faction objectives were targeted at each other when the Ordeal was created.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut they'll also be informed by which players are winning and losing.  If I'm winning the game and your faction and mine have goals that provide a tactical advantage for us to work together, then we will find narrative justification for our factions to team up.  At some point, however, I have to expect that the moment you achieve your goal, you'll turn on my.  And my proper response at that point is "Curse your sudden and inevitable betrayal".  So I'm motivated to not let you achieve your goal until I acheive mine...which creates enormous frictions that tends to keep such alliances fluid rather than game dominating.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuch alliances are also informed by previous play.  "Why did I just join your side in this Conflict only to use tactics that totally hose you and then drop out leaving you to get smoked...because two games ago you did the same to me.".  "Why did not support your challenge to keep primitive gunpowder out of the game?  Because earlier you sided with the guy who brought in purple intelligent duck people"  Such grudge holding serves a vital purpose, it makes everyone stop and think, if only just for a moment, before participating in a Challenge for gamey reasons.  What goes around comes around tends to keep people a bit more honest then if they can "cheat" with impunity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_142454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142454/#Comment_142454" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-05T11:52:10+00:00" title="May  5, 2008 11:52AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            DEATH TO CHARACTER LIMITS!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nThis last factor is the component that works best in longer term play when there's more time for it to come around.

I want the meta-game to infiltrate, drive, and be itself influenced by the SIS.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142554/#Comment_142554" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-05T18:59:26+00:00" title="May  5, 2008  6:59PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike,<br><br>I think we're coming down to a fundamental difference in our mindsets.

OK. Our milage varies. Is that you telling me to shut up about it? <br>\n<br>\nNo? You're just providing anothet data point, one that I already stipulated?<br>\n<br>\nOK, I'll just continue then if you don't mind. <br>\n<br>\nOr maybe we are done. <br>\n<br>\nHere's the thing. I want this game to work for me. If there were a way to get it so that I wasn't uncomfortable with it, I'm pretty sure that it wouldn't make the game bad for you Lance. I could be wrong about that, but is there some problem trying to figure out a way to solve this problem so that the group I represent, no matter how small, might also be satisfied? Indeed, I've been honest about this, I'm actually looking at this for my own greedy purposes because I'd like to make a game like this, but am running into precisely this sort of problem in my design efforts. If Ralph has solved the problem, then I want to know how he's done it.<br>\n<br>\nAnd, call me pompous, but I think that the issue is central to solving certain issues that are at the very center of all of RPGs. There is no more important subject than this one right now. Leave it to Ralph to attempt something that would address this, to try to solve this problem.  <br>\n<br>\nBut I'm afraid that he has not. While I'd agree that having what amounts to third parties intervening in challenges will more likely support a group aesthetic than just involving a couple of players, I think that it's a case of better, but not solved. Let's say we had an audience that did all of the voting, an audience interested only in a good story, and not in winning or losing... That would solve the problem, of eliminating the conflict of interest. Probably not at all what Ralph has in mind for the game, probably impractical, and not a solution that I like, either, but it should serve to show you where my problem is, at least. When a player is involved in trying to win the game, no matter how "removed" his pawns are from the action at hand, there's always a bias. Ralph admits that this is expected to happen, in fact, that it's part of the game. <br>\n<br>\nKnowing myself, and the people that I play with all the time, if we played with the understanding that it is OK to vote based on tactics, I'm seeing the aesthetics of it falling away entirely in short order. If they ever get established at all. And then, once again, you'll have the challenge being used constantly as a degenerate strategy. <br>\n<br>\nWith a mixed group you'll have me not doing that for social reasons, but feeling like a dolt for not pressing every mechanical advantage given to me. If I understand the rule to be aesthetic in nature, then I'll always feel uncomfortable with the conflcit of interest. <br>\n<br>\nAnyhow, I think we've reached an impasse here. I'm not seeing either side saying anything really new. Though I'll be reading in case I'm wrong. <br>\n<br>\nMike                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142643/#Comment_142643" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-06T09:43:07+00:00" title="May  6, 2008  9:43AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 6, 2008 9:44AM by Wolfe.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike, <br><br>No, it's more like saying I don't think I have anything more to contribute. I'll keep reading so long as you and Ralph want to continue the discussion, but I think our small part of this discussion is at an end.<br/><br/>It kind of comes down to this: I think I understand your concern. You have this thing you define as a problem. I define that same thing as a feature, or at the very least, as a non-problem. You haven't, to date, said anything to make me think it is a problem; most of the discussion seems to have been focused on trying to get me (and Ralph) to understand your concern. On the flip side, my own efforts to try to explain how it's not a problem aren't bearing fruit, because they don't remove your reasons for being concerned. Hence my classification of it as a fundamental difference in mindset.<br/><br/>As you said yourself, we're not really saying anything new. I know I'm not; I'm just trying to make the same points in different ways.<br/><br/>So, let's maybe try this from an entirely different direction. You want, I believe, all narration to have mechanical implications. I feel that's already pretty much the case. So, assuming I'm wrong, how might you improve the mechanics of narration to meet your goals?                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_142655">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142655/#Comment_142655" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-06T10:34:58+00:00" title="May  6, 2008 10:34AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 6, 2008 10:37AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All narration does, in fact, have mechanical effect in BRS. The fact that previous narration could, in theory, cause somebody to challenge you, means that you have to abide by it. The problem is not that narration has no effect, it's that the way in which it's given effect entails a conflict of interest. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I've said before, which might be confusing, is that I understand the impetus not to try to assign mechanical meaning in other ways. Because the method to do so generally means grouping actions into "categories" of action. Each with a method of mechanically dealing with those actions. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I worry about is that, if one did do this, that the narration would lose it's meaning. Ralph is avoiding that by using his method. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt's very much a damned if you do, and damned if you don't sort of situation. If you don't make the playing field rigorously mechanical, I find that I feel uncomfortable. If you do, I find that narration loses it's importance. This is the problem that I'm trying to overcome. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo whit, I've moved that general discussion over here: http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=6438<br/>\n<br/>\nThis thread should continue on with other's observations about the game. Or, if I've thouroughly sabotaged it, then a new thread would be good. Because there's a lot more to discuss with BRS than just my particular issue. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE
