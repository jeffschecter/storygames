There's a long way to go to get a lot of the adventures are funded, but there's still plenty of time if you're willing to get on board.<br/><br/>First, what the whole thing is about:\n<ul>\n<li>19 adventures by 19 different authors all up for crowdfunding in separate campaigns at the same time.<br/></li><li>Each adventure will be 32 or 48 pages, depending on the length of the adventure submitted by the writers and layout needs of the adventure.<br/></li><li>The adventures are for the LotFP Weird Fantasy RPG, but as LotFP is a second-generation "retro clone," the adventures will be easily compatible with all the other retro clones and the original games they are based on. Fans have also told me, to my amazement because this was never intended, that they have used LotFP adventures with games like D&amp;D 3.5, 4e, Pathfinder, Call of Cthulhu/Runequest/Stormbringer and other BRP games, Warhammer Fantasy RPG 1+2e, the Warhammer 40K RPGs, Rolemaster, Shadow of Yesterday, and probably more I'm forgetting. YOU CAN USE THESE ADVENTURES!<br/></li></ul>\nThe point of doing 19 adventures at once was to offer discounts for getting multiple adventure bundles. Those are still an option for those of you feeling confident or generous, but forget about that right now. Just look at individual adventures, and what the lower contribution levels get you for each adventure should they fund:\n<ul>\n<li>$10 gets you the adventure on PDF. Layered, bookmarked, linked, the whole shebang.<br/></li><li>$20 gets you the print version of the adventure shipped first class from Finland, plus the PDF.<br/></li><li>$30 gets you the print version of the adventure shipped first class from Finland, plus the PDF, plus an exclusive print + PDF sandbox setting by Rob Conley (Majestic Wilderlands, Points of Light 1 &amp; 2, etc.) that will not be available in any format anywhere except as a bonus item in these campaigns. You also get a bonus "What I Would Do With This Adventure in My Campaign" sheet by James Edward Raggi IV.<br/></li><li>These options all include an "OGL 3.PF" conversion PDF by Owen K.C. Stephens.<br/></li></ul>\nEven if any particular adventure had $0 pledged on it (and all have a lot more than that), it would only take 200 people to get an adventure funded at the $30 level. Me, I think for example Vincent Baker has 200 fans that could gain enjoyment and game value out of his adventure and the bonus sandbox that comes along with it. The same holds true for Mike Pohjola and Anna Kreider and each and every author. We have plenty of time to get this done. (As I write this Baker still needs 88 contributions at this level to fund. Jeff Rients needs LESS THAN 30.)<br/><br/>So why should *you* participate in this?\n<ul>\n<li>You are putting money into the creator's hands. Over 50% of each adventure's $6000 goal goes directly to the writer and the artist. Plus money to the editor. And the layout/graphic designer. LotFP won't make a dime until after these are printed and put into general sale for all the non-diehards who didn't jump on the campaigns.<br/></li><li>Each author gets "final cut" on the adventure. You're getting what Jeff Rients wants to do. What Kelvin Green wants to do. What Anna Kreider wants to do. LotFP will provide editorial input but the writer has final say, and sets the tone for the artwork.<br/></li><li>You are getting these authors into stores and the public consciousness, possibly creating greater interest in them and their other work. LotFP now goes through Impressions to reach distribution, the same company that Goodman Games, Pelgrane Press, and more uses to reach retail. The $6000 goal includes a large enough print run to go into distribution, so supporting these campaigns means we can get names like Jeff Rients, Michael Curtis, Kevin Crawford, etc on (more) shelves and taking up gamer headspace.<br/></li><li>COOL ADVENTURES! HELLO!<br/></li></ul>\nSome of the adventures have extra perk options:\n<ul>\n<li>Kelvin Green's <a href="http://igg.me/p/153307?a=396659" rel="nofollow">Horror Among Thieves</a> has a special deal going... we're publishing the adventure whether or not it funds.

Seriously, both are close to funding...think about this, drop $30 on one, get two adventures if one funds. Drop $20 on the other, and get if that funds...if neither funds, you get your money back. <br/><br/>Its only 6 days out, so during that time you can fast and make sacrifices to the appropiate crowdfunding gods, and save the money you could've otherwise spent.
