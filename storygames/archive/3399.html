Like, for instance, you can come at it from "I want to play a Princess ... what type?" <b>OR</b> "I want to play a Feisty character, but who?"<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, what with one thing and another, the classes are going to be a feedback-for-playing-to-class system somewhat like TSoY Keys ... "Princess:  Draw a card if you demand special treatment.  Draw a card if your position helps achieve your goals.  Draw a card if you act from the conviction that you're better than other people."<br/>\n<br/>\nNow here's the thing:  Each of those three "Draw a card" things above is subtly different.  The first is "<b>Do</b> something specific and draw a card."  The second is "<b>Achieve</b> something specific, and draw a card."  The third is "<b>Think</b> a certain way, and draw a card."<br/>\n<br/>\nTSoY pretty much tosses all of these together in a wonderfully muddled gumbo, and I'm down with that.  <i>But</i>, I'm also thinking "Hey, these are really different goals to play toward in the game ... whole different mindsets, really ... I wonder if there's any value to separating them out."<br/>\n<br/>\nNow <i>Misery Bubblegum</i> already has a (separate) "Achieve something and get a resource" mechanic, so I'm looking at the first and third:  The thing you do, or the things you think.  My first instinct was to say "Well, the person you are (Princess) should have rewards for the things you do, whereas the personality you bring to it (Feisty) should have rewards for way you think."<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what if I reversed them?  What if I deliberately cut against the <i>easy</i> way to think about it?  I'm tempted, and not <i>just</i> to be an iconoclast.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuppose you've got:  "PRINCESS:  Draw a card when you act from a conviction that you deserve special treatment.  Draw a card when you act from a conviction that you're better and smarter than other people.  Draw a card when you act from a conviction that other people desire your approval," and "FEISTY:  Draw a card when you confront authority.  Draw a card when you act recklessly.  Draw a card when you choose conflict over collaboration."<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that may help a player to <i>show</i> their character's feistiness, and to <i>feel</i> the role of a princess.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you think?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76807">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76807/#Comment_76807" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-20T11:07:39+00:00" title="June 20, 2007 11:07AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that's elegant.

There was even some discussion about <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1816&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">anime-oriented verbs and adverbs shortly after that</a>. That's getting off-topic, though.<br><br>Tony, I really like where you're going in this design. There's just one sticking point, and it might just be my own misunderstanding. I'm just not seeing the distinction between persona and action.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>I think that may help a player to<em>show</em>their character's feistiness, and to<em>feel</em>the role of a princess.</blockquote>\nIt seems like <i>all</i> of the "draw a card" prerequisites are directed towards showing off the Feisty or Princess attributes through the character's actions. Indeed, almost everyone has the word "act" in the description. I don't really see "feeling" so much, except as expressed through actions by the character in the game.<br><br>That's not a bad thing. It all goes back to "show, don't tell." I'm just not really seeing as much of a division between "feeling" and "doing." I'd even go so far as to say a character's feelings are irrelevant <i>except</i> as they're expressed in the game. Unless you have some mechanics related to characters' emotions, independent of their deeds, I'm still not seeing the split.<br><br>That would be an interesting design challenge though, having mechanics related to your character's current emotional state. I remember when I played D&amp;D and my character got bitten by a were-raptor (long story). The DM said I'd turn into a raptor every time I got angry. Thing is, there were no mechanics to tell me my character's current emotions. I'd just ask the DM "Am I angry yet?"

I'm not saying that you aren't <i>both</i> choosing the character's actions and feeling the character's internal balance at all times.  You clearly are.  <br><br><i>But</i>...<br><br>It's easier to <i>notice</i> what you're doing when the rules system draws your attention to it.  It's not that you won't do it anyway, but you do <i>lots of stuff</i> and only some of it breaks the surface tension of your attention.<br/><br/>Now if "Princess" rewards you for acting in certain ways then you pay attention to how a Princess acts.  Yeah, you have a coherent character, and so she's acting in that way for some reason, but the rules system doesn't prompt you to look at that too closely.  You might, or you might not.  But the rules system would make <i>damn sure</i> that you're paying attention to the kind of things that a Princess does.  If she gets a bonus for bossing people around then you'll pay attention to making sure that she bosses people around.<br/><br/>Thing is, I don't think people <i>need</i> that help.  I think that when they're playing a Princess they'll have the bossing-around thing as part of their initial image, and they'll do it without help.  What they <i>might</i> well need some help with is to get a handle on the type of things that motivate the Princess to be bossy that way.  They know how a Princess <i>acts</i>, now they could use an assist on how a Princess <i>feels</i>.<br/><br/>Likewise, if Feisty rewards were all about thinking that authority sucks, and like that ... okay.  That's reinforcing stuff that players already know.  They know how Feisty <i>feels</i>.  They could use an assist on how a Feisty character <i>acts</i> in order to show that they're Feisty.<br/><br/>Does that make more sense of my original sentence?  The player needs to both show and feel both roles ... but one role is easy to show, and so should get some help in being felt ... and the other role is easy to feel, so it's good to help the player to show it.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_77294">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77294/#Comment_77294" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-23T22:30:10+00:00" title="June 23, 2007 10:30PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sydney Freedberg</cite>If there needs to be a distinction -- I'm intrigued, but not convinced </blockquote>But wait!  There's more!  If you order now you also get this fine set of ginsu knives!<br/><br/>Or, rather ... if you have a system where you can combine two Keys that are in the same categories (both action, or both motive) then you get the possibility of doubling up in a way that lets you get points <i>whatever you do</i>.  This screws the motivating aspect of Keys, by making all actions equal again.<br/><br/>For instance, if one Key reads "Draw a card when you ignore someone's feelings" and another Key reads "Draw a card when you pay attention to someone's feelings" then there's no motivating factor there any more.  You can draw a card whenever you want ... you don't get any guidance about good behavior.<br/><br/>By having the two roles you choose be in two <i>inherently independent</i> types of Keys, the game design can guarantee that nobody ever gets overlap of that kind.  That way every single combination of roles is a combination with powerful synergies.  Obedient Princess is not some pale shadow of the glory that is Feisty Princess ... it's its own thing, with its own interesting geometry.<br/><br/>Does that make sense?
