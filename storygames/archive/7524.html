How it would be different or what considerations would have to be taken for different disabilities. I was intrigued by the idea of a game specifically designed for, say, blind players, but that could be played by anyone. Somethign in its design makes it more accessible to players who can't read a traditional text or dice, etc. <br/><br/>So, no, I'm not talking about a specific disability, but rather just trying to look at it in a broad range, at some of the considerations.<br/><br/>ME                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166989">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166989/#Comment_166989" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-04T10:07:54+00:00" title="September  4, 2008 10:07AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Are you asking about specific disabilities?

From the STD (Gold Candidate):<br/><span style="color: #0000CC;"><i>Safe Character </i>(SC) \u2013 An injured or disabled player who wears a blaze orange headband and does not wield Weapons. The player may not be the target of a Touch, Aura, Throw, or Projectile Attack; likewise, the player may not use Touch, Aura, Throw, or Projectile Attacks, though he or she may use Palm, beneficial Throw Abilities, or Stare Attacks or Abilities. The player\u2019s character is considered present.</span><br/><br/>So they can play all sorts of roles--even combat roles--but are never at risk of physical contact (barring a combat swirling too closely around them--but that's what "HOLD!" is for).<br/><br/>That said, unrestricted GLASS uses far too many Verbals for it to be easily played by someone with a hearing disability. Although a game type could be setup which only permitted Gesture-based Abilities (all Weapon hits are for 1 per hand employed, i.e. a two-handed attack does 2).<br/>-----<br/>In general, I think that being accommodating is preferable to designing with disabilities in mind or at the forefront. Techniques are rarely "hard-coded" into RPG designs, so there's a variety of ways that the disabled could work around issues with reading the text (screen readers, PDFs), manipulating the randomizers (use a web site and activate Read Aloud on results), and handling information (type into laptop and screen readers). One MIGHT get some good traction and adoption, though, by offering a Braille version (or running Braille intersperse between printed lines in all versions) of a game which has little to no handling elements to resolve mechanics--even if the blind are "reading" pipped dice, they still have to find them after a roll, to pick them up!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_167008">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167008/#Comment_167008" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-04T11:10:10+00:00" title="September  4, 2008 11:10AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 4, 2008 11:10AM by JDCorley.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have a player who is quite hard-of-hearing and has attention issues related to that - consciously accommodating her is a very rewarding challenge, I find.

I deal with accessibility issues as part of my day job (i.e. web development), so I usually start by asking which kind of disabilities are we trying to workaround. Besides sight/reading related disabilities, there are many other forms (e.g. learning, cognitive, speech, hearing) of impairments that cause different problems. This just defines the constraints we need to design around. For example if the game is supposed to be accessible to blind people one design choice could be "minimize written text as a game tool", so we could just abolish character sheets, drop out dice in favor of bidding mechanics using physical tokens, emphasize textual descriptions and metaphors, use game boards to convey information (the ideas behind chess boards for blind people are very useful). Even then early playtesting is essential: unless the designer also has the disability he will miss many pitfalls that blind people will find in a few minutes. Another issue is trying to improve the usability for a blind player vs. creating a game that's accessible to a all blind group. IMHO much of the material available to create accessible web design is useful to game design too, but some creativity is required to adapt the ideas.</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_167154">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167154/#Comment_167154" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-04T21:14:50+00:00" title="September  4, 2008  9:14PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 4, 2008 9:15PM by Mcdaldno.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Michael,<br/><br/><b>There are ways to reduce entry barriers</b>. If a player has difficulty processing numbers, a game without numbers or with fewer interactions with numbers has a reduced entry barrier.<br/><br/><b>There are ways to provide supports</b>. If a player has difficulty processing numbers, having another player help with calculations would be supportive. A useful tool might be a reference guide.<br/><br/>And I think this might be "providing supports" as well, but I'm not sure: If a player has difficulty processing numbers, you can reduce the impact this has on play by giving buffer time. Announce a calculation you need made right before taking a break ("Okay, orcs burst forward. Let's take a five minute break, and I'll need your Opportunity Bonuses.")<br/><br/>A game designer has more capacity to affect entry barriers than a GM or fellow player, I think. A GM or fellow player has more capacity to develop/implement/suggest targeted, specific supports than a game designer does (because a game designer is not at the table/doesn't know the person and difficulty).<br/><br/>I think the single biggest thing to be conscious of in designing/re-tooling/presenting/GMing games for people with specific disabilities or difficulties is to give them the opportunity to advocate for themselves, and expect them to be leaders in leveling the playing field. If someone struggles with math, they will know specifically what struggles they have, and if they're lucky they'll have found through experience tools and approaches that work for them. Empower them to tell you what is troubling them, and work with them to set up tools and options that enable success. And by "empower them", I mean be open to hearing suggestions, invite criticism, speak to people both in groups and privately, and expect the people you game with to be generally capable people.<br/><br/>In short: As always, the solution is to be reactive to your players, their needs, and their desires.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
