Organize them. Study them. Forget them. Burn the notebooks. Make stuff up.<br/>3. Make sure that the rules actively support the game's core themes (shooting, stabbing, blowing things up, devouring flesh).<br/>4. Write the book in my 'voice'. The text should be every bit as sarcastic, profane, and irreverent as I am.<br/>5.

These general principles apply to all of theses game formats.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Clear rules that can be easily understood<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Balanced rules. There shouldn't be any single method of play, combination of options, etc, which overpower the other options given in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Keep an open slate of options. The rules or game format should not drive players towards a singular set of choices. Players should be free to make all the choices possible within the game structure (and in RPGs that generally means attempt any damn thing their characters can try, stupid or not) and the rules should be prepared for a means to handle the unexpected choices. Ideally resolution of the unexpected should be easily contained within the same core mechanics that run everything else.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) The rules should help capture the theme, genre or setting the game is placed in. Rules by themselves are merely a mechanical means to resolve tasks. The rules ideally should also help to paint the setting of the game or at least give it some of the flavor. Its understandable if non rules text needs to do the bulk of this work, but absolutely the format of the rules should not detract from it.<br/>\n<br/>\n5) Know how I am going to produce the game ahead of time. That way I can plot out all of the material components of the game and its price structures before I delve into the design stage beyond initial concept. This way I end up with a game design that is functional for publication and fits the economic structures needed to hit the price range ideal for the game's best placement on the pricing to sales curve and therefore giving my company the best chance of fiscal success in the marketing of the product.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I had to look at 5 critical issues of design, those would be it. Obviously you can drill down a little deeper on what items 2-4 mean once you identify the exacting game type and genre/setting its is being bundled with, but no way I'm going to try and cover all of that. lol.<br/>\n<br/>\nRyan S.

Make sure your game is about something other people will want to play. This is really important. No-one wants to play that game that's about raping people with your flower-penis, nor do they want to play that one about being like D&amp;D only cutting out all that silly <i>roleplaying</i> and getting to the <i>good stuff</i> straight away (becoming gods). Very few people even want to play the game where you're all drug-crazed criminals who rampage about, kill and murder and eventually get shot to death by angry policemen, even though they're all well written and have good systems.<br/><br/>2. The system has to be relevant to the story or game you want to play. Poker is cool, but its theme is gambling and bluffing, so it won't work in a game where there's no gambling or bluffing going on. A system which is based around accumulations of chance or time are appropriate to games where time and chance are important (take Stitch, for example) but just feel tacked on otherwise. Dice-based systems aren't evil, because they at least tend not to clash with the feel of the game, being pretty much generic. Don't be afraid to keep in less fashionable items like a GM if they will help the game run better.<br/><br/>3. Don't skip on the prose. You have a vision for the game and how it should be played, but no-one else has that vision unless you detail it for them. Never presume other people 'get it'; write it down for them, including GM or Player styles, attitudes and goals, and background/setting materials.<br/><br/>4. Keep your focus. Decide what you're doing and stick with it. If necessary, walk away from the game for a bit to let your accumulated distractions from the core concept drift away, and get back to what you wanted to write in the first place. This includes things like suddenly deciding you want a GM-less game because you were just reading a forum and it sounded great; losing track of your core setting because you had a great idea for other ways to play the game and you're suddenly trying to write the game to allow for that alternative; and re-vamping your whole game because its just too G/N/S, and you don't want to be like all those <i>other games</i> which are already under discussion of that type. Be true to your game idea.<br/><br/>5. 4-eyes checking - get someone else to look over your game, before you even get to the playtest stage. This is your game, which means you're too close to it to spot the obvious flaws yourself most of the time. Basic Maths can escape even the most intelligent of designers when they're tired or on a roll, and glaring mistakes or holes are demoralising if they're only found once you've shown the game to a playtest group and they come out in front of a bunch of people. You've got to protect your will to continue and get it done.<br/><br/>Other important issues: Spell checking! Proof-reading! Advertising! Demoing! Advertising some more! And never, ever, be clever at the expense of producing a good game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94146">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clyde%20L.%20Rhoer" title="Clyde L.

Do not try to be (too) clever with the rules. If you want some interactions to happen in the game, try to write rules which get you there the shortest route possible. (More indirect rules can be interesting, but too many of them will fast make the game incomprehensible.)<br/><br/>3. Decide what the players (including the GM) should be able to do in the game for it to work properly and then make sure that the rules support these actions.<br/><br/>4.

It actually used drug-taking as the core resolution and spellcasting mechanic, that's how deliberately tasteless it was. The flower-penis game is real too, and the other one was a paraphrasing of the infamous Senzar, which was so bad as to give me panic attacks from reading it.<br/><br/>But you get the idea. A game about beating babies to death with frozen seals (or vice versa) doesn't make for playability for the majority of people. And if it does make for playability for you, I don't want to game with you.

I can't believe no one's done a game about it yet! But it's perfect. Instead of attributes like Stamina and Will, you have Stamen-A and Wilt. And instead of skills like Hunting, you have Stalk-ing. It's clever, but not <i>too</i> clever.<br/><br/>Wow... now that I think about it, I actually wrote a poem for the first edition of Dread that actually encompasses the entire concept of flower-penis-rapists:\n<blockquote>Now let us venture into fields replete<br/>With warm sap, brim-full of tender tissue,<br/>Slender stalks swaying neath blossoms swollen<br/>With nectar and pollen, drowsy with heat.<br/>Now let us cull the dry chaff from the wheat<br/>And enter pink skin to force the issue;<br/>We\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll separate the loose fronds of sullen<br/>Sweet flesh, and thresh hard bone from pliant meat.</blockquote>\nIt's perfect, it's all coming together (no pun intended). Seriously, I can't believe that this is untapped territory. But what kind of mechanic are we talking about? Maybe you build a "flower" with dice -- like some yellow ones in the middle, surrounded by a bunch of white ones, and you've got yourself a daisy. Then you 'pluck' the petals by rolling dice as the situation warrants it. A bizarre and grotesque play on the 'she loves me, she loves me not' trope. Which reinforces the notion of our demented stalker-flower.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.dread-rpg.com/daisy.jpg"/><br/><br/>So you have three d6s in the middle, surrounded by pairs (representing the distorted love-pairing of your psychopathic player character and the object of his grotesque affection). You can 'pluck' a pair of dice, depending on some kind of metagame resource, and you try to beat the roll of the three d6s, rolled by the GM. It's much easier on a pair of d12s than a pair of d8s or d6s, but that's where the strategy comes in... You have to know that you're going to fail a few times, and you want to save the d12s and d20s for the climactic (ho ho) finale.<br/><br/>But what do I call this magnum opus? Let's see... <i>Daisy Cutter</i>? No, too obvious. <i>Flower Power</i>? Mmm, no.<br/><br/>Ah... aha... AHAHAHAHAHA! OF COURSE! I SHALL CALL IT <i>PISTIL-WHIPPED</i>!

Creating a version-control plan to manage the process is vital for design methods that generate lots of drafts.<br/><br/>Also, there is no better way to kill an outside playtesting group's desire to help you than to pump out draft after draft of changes week after week, especially if you don't keep a log of changes.<br/><br/>Ideally, your game will be substantially designed and revised during your in-house playtesting process. The outside playtesting groups won't be there to test the game (which will be running the way you want it to with your home group), but the game text. They'll be playing to make sure your game text provides all the necessary information and context to allow others to understand how to play the game the way your home group does. In this case, changes during the outside playtesting stage are likely to be minor, and to respond directly to the playtesting group's issues.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jared%20A.%20Sorensen" title="Jared A.

But it's equally important when just writing documents, specs, and game rules. Not only is it nice to have that sheaf of prior versions to go back through but keeping track of changes helps to prevent legacy issues from creeping back into the text.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94377">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marhault" title="Marhault"><img alt="Marhault" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/FVPm0IriH9fQR-IQjP8BZg?authkey=Gv1sRgCK_6-fm2q9207gE&amp;feat=directlink"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marhault">Marhault</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94377/#Comment_94377" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-10T11:08:07+00:00" title="September 10, 2007 11:08AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks guys!
