It would be great if everyone who owned it could avail of the improvements. Here is a <a href="http://cobwebgames.com/downloads/filestorage/CoS_1.1.pdf" rel="nofollow">direct link to the PDF</a>.<br/><br/>I'm much happier with the layout of the text (which allows for home printing), the text itself (which includes 2.5k words of extended examples and clarifications) and the three bits of errata (listed below).\n<ul>\n<li>Puppet/Event cost: Page 11 of the new text, in which a puppet/event may be played without tokens.</li>\n<li>Tragedy narration: Page 14 of the new text, in which players narrate even when they "succumb."</li>\n<li>Chronicle voting: Page 37 of the new text, in which the winner receives six tokens instead of four.</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
