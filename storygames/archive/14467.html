I was the GM. Andy, Lisa, Mark, and Matt played PCs.<br/><br/>Ostensibly we were playing by the newest beta edition.  However, the copy Andy printed out was difficult to read, so we ended up using my 11.05.16 edition as reference a majority of the time.<br/><br/>Our total play session was about 4 hours long.  We spent about two hours making characters and discussing the system before we got into our first scene.  There was only one Contention which went uncompleted.  I'll come back to that Contention in detail in a bit.<br/><br/><b>Character Generation</b><br/>The only quibble I have with making characters is the section on assigning relationship adjectives.  While I enjoy the creative constraint it provides, I have to say that it felt like an overly long and wasted step.  We fleshed out relationships to NPCs before we even met them.  Before we even knew with certainty that we would meet them.<br/><br/>Otherwise, I enjoy character creation quite a bit.<br/><br/><b>Objects</b><br/>It's a minor complaint, but I feel that some of the object tags are really quite weak.  I like it when tags either add something to the narration or are limited in scope.  "Short Range" limits me and adjusts my narration.  "Blunt" doesn't do anything for me.<br/><br/>A katana has "deadly"?  Really?  What does that add to the contention?  Does one really need to be inspired to kill with a katana?  I'd go with "stylish", myself.  Everyone knows you can kill with a sword.  Tell us something else about it.<br/><br/><b>Transmissions</b><br/>I love them.  I eat them up.  Without any preparation at all, without having to take time out from helping players make their characters, I was able to create a plot seed.  That plot seed inspired multiple potential starting scenes.  The moment a player started interrogating a contact, I rolled for where it might lead.  Bam!  Plot was added that I never would have considered.  New story emerged.  <br/><br/>I never once hesitated to come up with an awesome scene, even though I really had no idea where the plot was taking us.  And yet, I still had the sensation of a fully formed noir plot revolving around us.  It's brilliant. <br/><br/><b>Contentions</b><br/>I do not like them.  The word "broken" got tossed around our table once or twice.  I don't think contentions are broken.  I just don't like them.  I like the idea that PCs can get hurt in such a way as to force them into more cyber, but I think I can honestly say that this is the only aspect I do like.  The rest turns me off.<br/><br/>To be more specific without digging too deeply at the game, I don't like the way any of the three options for removing a character from the contention work.  That is, I enjoy the idea that characters can give, get killed, or fall out from excessive damage, I just don't like the mechanisms that Technoir uses to support those three options.<br/><br/>While all the other parts of Technoir I don't like can be house-ruled, contentions are a deal breaker for me.  If I am going to play this game again, it will be with the contention system full stripped out and replaced with something else.  A system still gritty and dangerous, but altered to provide the moments of decision and narration that I enjoy.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329257/#Comment_329257" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-12T13:04:57+00:00" title="June 12, 2011  1:04PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I want to hear more about what seemed off with contentions.  You suggest that the key part you don't like is how characters get removed from a contention, but then you say that can't be house ruled and the whole system needs torn out and replaced...sounds like there were more issues than just that.<br/>\n<br/>\nWithout having played the Red Flag items for me (i.e. things to pay attention to in play) were<br/>\n<br/>\n1) the cancelation effect of Hurt dice which seemed like it could simultaneously be extremely random (a single hurt die could in some situations virtually wipe out an entire roll, while several hurt dice in other situations have no real effect at all) and potentially game halting...without crunching the numbers I suspect there's a level of negative adjectives that renders a character mostly impotent except for the luckiest of rolls.  My gut-reaction-without-having-played is that a Smallville-esque system of granting some kind of complicating resource to the GM for matches rather than canceling dice outright might make for smoother probabilities.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) I couldn't follow the "give in" system.  I could probably invent a scenario, play it out and try to apply the Give In rules as written to teach myself what they are about, but from the text I couldn't tell when and why a character might want to give, what exactly the down side was from giving vs. the upside of gaining (seeming) immunity from further beating, or what the design was trying to accomplish with these rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329259">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329259/#Comment_329259" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-12T15:34:22+00:00" title="June 12, 2011  3:34PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's not that it can't be hacked.  It cannot be hacked to my satisfaction.  There is simply too much that would have to change.  One may as well re-write the whole thing.<br><br>Andy has asked me to go into some details that we discussed at the table the other day.  I'm going to try to do that, but I want to point out that the specific issues I'm about to outline are not the sole issues I have with the system.  They are just the issues that are most important to me.  Please bear in mind, when I say "issue", what I really mean is "a thing that was not fun for me".<br><br>Also, I hesitate to write this up here because I'm not particularly interested in discussing my dislikes in public.  I've expressed my opinion to my friends and I have received their feedback.  I am posting my opinions here this evening for no other reason than feedback.  And I'm not sure this feedback will have any value to the game's designer, as it is primarily composed of taste and opinion.<br><br>The very top issue I have is with the giving in mechanisms.  Specifically, what happens when the GM uses three push dice to kill the PC.<br/>*If the player of the PC does not have any push dice, the character dies and is removed from the conflict.  Therefore, once you give up your last push die, you have opened your character to a sudden death.<br/>*If the player chooses to avoid death via a push die, the GM keeps the three dice they offered up to kill the PC and adds the one push die the PC player used to avoid death.  Now the GM has at least four push dice.  All other PCs in the conflict are now in greater danger of dying or being ousted from the conflict.<br/>*If the player does have a push die left to avoid the death of their PC, the choice they have to make is unsatisfying.  Either the PC can be ousted from the conflict or they can be dead... and ousted from the conflict.  The only benefit gained from accepting death is to remove the GM's push dice from play, so that the other PCs have a greater chance of surviving and succeeding in this conflict.  <br/>*I love give in mechanisms.  But I only love them when the situation escalation foreshadows future harm.  I don't want to give in because my character lost his nose.  I want to give in because my character is afraid to lose his nose.  And, if I'm going to do that, I'd better save my points.<br/>*All these things add up to "pulling punches".  I can't play to the hilt as a PC or as the GM without stepping into mechanisms that I don't enjoy.  <br/><br/>Please understand that my distaste for the give in mechanism is not due to any of those bullet points individually.  It's the sum of the total that puts a bad taste in my mouth.<br/><br/>I don't like the knock-out method of ending a conflict because I cannot depend on it.  It's much too random.  Like you said, Ralph, one hurt die could oust a character and a dozen might never get in the way.  This rule can't do anything for me but disappoint.<br/><br/>The idea that the GM should have his NPCs give in when the players have hit them with the an adjective that he thinks would make the NPC give up, or when the narration reaches its natural conclusion... I cannot properly express how much I don't like that.  At least, not without unintentionally talking trash.  Let me leave my opinion of that option at:  No thank you.  That's not for me.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329273/#Comment_329273" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-12T17:47:41+00:00" title="June 12, 2011  5:47PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eric Provost</cite>A katana has "deadly"?

It fits the genre I think. "stylish" means you can draw Push dice when walking down a fashion runway. "Deadly" means that when you pull it out, it's that much easier to kill something with it (rather than using it to cut through locks, walls, tanks, etc). Guns don't need Deadly IMO because they have a lot of other useful adjectives (short range, etc). But deadly for the katana and blunt for the baton work for me, indicating that it's easier to do certain things with those tools.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329284">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329284/#Comment_329284" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-12T18:42:00+00:00" title="June 12, 2011  6:42PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with your point, Andy.

In the end it took about 20-30 minutes to "go", the 2 hour thing was us basically fucking around talking Friend-Stuff.<br/><br/>I kinda wish this thread was a continuation of the other feedback thread, but oh well. Since we're here now, here were my notes, based on the newest Beta version:<br/><br/>* The Profession/Verb chart is listed on three pages in a row of the rulebook (something like p 12, 14, 16 or something like that). Seemed a little excessive, but likely an editing oversight.<br/><br/>* In the rulebook there's a flying car called a "Gremlin", but in the Player's Book it's not there. Seems like a small miss, but because it wasn't listed we had a player spend a lot extra on a helicopter thinking that was the only flying vehicle.<br/><br/>* So there's this trend I've been seeing called "Narration Exhaustion". Basically, sometimes you just need to let your brain rest for a minute and Pick Something from a List. To that end, all of us agreed on this: The Verb List (in the Player's Guide) has sample adjectives to be used for contentions involving those Verbs. We'd like to see more, maybe a sample list of 10 or so (somewhere else, maybe in the contention section or something) to combat this fatigue. And like the other adjectives, it's clear that to come up with them on the spot is The Best, but there's times when you just want to shut your brain off for a sec so you don't tire out. More "sample bad adjectives to tag your opponent with, grouped by Verb" would be Awesome.<br/><br/>OK, got some more, basically the three big issues we had; longer post.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329290">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329290/#Comment_329290" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-12T19:37:50+00:00" title="June 12, 2011  7:37PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 12, 2011 7:40PM by Andy.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            * Eric's comments re pulling punches are kinda huge. So, basically, we had a contention between my Vietnamese yakuza hacker ("<b>Ng</b>in3ar") and basically Angela Bassett-as-Strange-Days-street samurai ("Door") and two hitmen of sorts, "Nevada and Alaska". They were getting away, I hacked their car while Door punched them in their face-holes. This was the second contention, so Eric (GM) had two Push dice from before, and we each lay one Stickied adjective on them, which meant Eric had, in his hands, 4 Push dice.<br/><br/>This is when he looked down at his four dice, and the contention kind of ground to a halt because we started walking through what must logically come next, and since Antagonists succeed quite a bit in their areas of expertise, these were logical assumptions based on their success:<br/><br/>-=Eric can have the NPCs run away with the damage they have now. Weakish.<br/><br/>-=Eric pulls his punch and narrates in a Permanent 2-Push-dice injury (and that's what he ended up doing: Blast to the face, Door loses her eyes, will need cyber-eyes). But he's really kinda pulling his punches, because...<br/><br/>-=...it's been about 15 minutes into the game, and the GM has the capacity to kill off a PC. 3 of those 4 dice narrated in; if successful, "You're dead, start over". Which does sorta fit the pulp nature of the game, but 15 minutes into the game? Hmmm.<br/><br/>-= Or, and this is the other gotcha: Eric pushes the 3 dice to Lisa: "Door dies". Lisa has one Push Die left. She says, "No, I'm still alive" and to do that has to give Eric her Push die. That was Too Easy. Now Eric has *5* Push dice, and can basically turn to the next character who enters a Contention: "3 push dice, you die. Oh you don't? Then give me one of your dice. And now I have 6. 7. 8" and so on. And then we're still left with the conclusion of "needing to pull your punches with the system else PC death is pretty quick and fast as soon as they start tagging NPCs with Sticky/Permanent adjectives.<br/><br/>To summarize: There's this cool gamey aspect of Technoir that is basically a blow-by-blow of narration and trading dice. But to basically keep the game fun, the GM and Players have to pull their punches, they can't simply go "all in". And here I don't mean "You have to restrain yourself from being a dick" or anything like that. But the GM has to aim to Sticky and Permanent on adjectives when they Could kill a PC, otherwise the game will get its first PC kill pretty much right after she gets 3 or 4 Push dice. And she could (without realizing the system implications) accidentally bully all of the players out of their dice by playing hard in the rules, "Your character dies. No? Then give me a Push Die. Now I have More."<br/><br/>Now, after we realized this, we thought of all the emergent behavior of the players not pushing all their Push dice, basically trying to keep one behind in case they need it to resist death, and we indeed found that there is in fact this majestic, complex, and very interesting depth to the whole Use or Non-Use of Push Dice for the players... but it seems to be really undermined by the fact that when the GM says "Your character dies", if you don't want that to happen (and this condition can be met VERY early in the game, I'm not talking the end of a 4-hour game where that sort of thing seems likely and favorable to the story) you have to give away your only resource to stop it to happen again next time.<br/><br/>How to fix it? Dunno. We thought of a few things, but all fell apart upon further thinking it through.<br/>I might posit that you may need another resource entirely to ward off death. Something like: All players get one "life stone". If the GM says "you die", then someone can toss in their own life stone to cancel that from happening: If the player themselves, then they are saved from their own skill and luck. If another player, then that character somehow saved the character-in-danger. And the 3 Push dice go away from the GM back to the Player whose character was in danger. You only get one ever (or one per session). Which means that the GM has some weight to play harder/really use the system to either whittle the players down through sticky/permanent adjectives, or aim for the kill to lower the party's Life Stones, which also means that death can happen if the GM plays hard, it just happens later in the game and not in the first 20 minutes. Something like that.<br/><br/>* Ralph/Eric: The Wound Die system doesn't seem bad as-is. I actually like it a lot. When rolling a Verb, you have a 33% chance of rolling a 5 or 6 which is almost always a success (or a 16.5% chance of rolling a 6, which IS always a success). When you get wounded, you better use the Story Elements that help you heal (Escorts + Treat == This Game Wins, both Eric and I agree) or you are really risking the 33% chance that the Hurt die will come up 5 or 6, and take out all those 5s or 6es. That risk seems fine IMO. Most contentions we played out didn't go to more than 3 Hurt dice before concluding (in a Give In, see below). I don't see a problem there...<br/><br/>* ...but I think we uncovered the problem with the math in the "Way that Contentions End without Giving In: Having your Hurt Dice cancel out all your Action/Push dice", aka "Force-Outs". By the math alone, I don't think Force-Outs will ever happen. That is to say, "unless you are rolling only 1-2 Action/Push dice and have 4+ hurt dice, someone will give in due to... well, basically boredom... before a Force-Out would ever happen." In many conflicts we are rolling 3 Action dice (to do things our character is good at). Think of the odds of rolling three dice (usually getting 2-3 separate numbers) and then rolling 2, 3, 4... even 5 or 6 dice and have them come up the exact same as those numbers you threw. In practice, we never saw it happen or get anywhere close to a Force Out.<br/><br/>-= Which is kinda important, because many of the conflicts we were in, the players were very invested in success (and thus not conceding by Giving In), and the antagonists (as portrayed by the GM) were very interested in not failing. For example, in the street fight I indicate above, we weren't just out to shoot a couple of thieves: These two just killed a witness (and "nice girl") who was our main lead in a job that was going to pay us enough money to stay off the streets. Likewise, the Hit Squad wanted to not get caught to protect their employer and their boss. This was honestly a conflict where neither side was really going to Give In until the rules made us, and we were fine with that: But the rules never made us, because no one ever got close to having their Action/Push dice cancelled by their Hurt dice on either side of the contention.<br/><br/>-= Which makes the game basically one of "Enter into contentions until one side or the other Gives In and accepts the consequences. And that's really the only way to play." Which is fine if explained such up-front, but that Force-Out option actually seems viable until the dice hit the table and you see the results. <br/><br/>-= Of course, after several rounds of conflict where neither side is going to back down, things start to get boring, so one of the players, out of being nice (or wanting to move things along) will Give In, but not for any story reason; just to keep the game moving.<br/><br/>-= And as Ralph noted, the consequence of Giving In is basically, "Yep I accept whatever you were going to do to me", which is brutal for the Giver. Frex, in the streetfight above, the "bad guys running away" turned into a "gunfight in the middle of an intersection". The initial goal of the bad guys was to get away, but now they're in the middle of a gunfight shooting at the PCs. At that point the goal isn't "I want to get away", but "I want to take these guys down (kill them) so I can get away." Maybe the solution would have been for Eric as GM to say, "OK guys, if you want to Give In, they won't kill you but rather Get Away, and tag you with the Adjective "frustrated" ." ...but I guess at that point the fight was so furious that it was hard to consider that. I dunno.<br/><br/>Conclusion: Forced Out doesn't seem to work by the numbers. Without a viable option to semi-quickly (read "not take forever") Force Out, then every conflict simply plays out until one side Gives In.

And from there, things that Eric didn't like I totally did, or we had differences of opinion on how problematic a certain rule was, and so on.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329291">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329291/#Comment_329291" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-12T19:52:17+00:00" title="June 12, 2011  7:52PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            * Finally, in the interest of disclosure, there was one part I realize now that conceptually we messed up: Contentions don't *really* go "back and forth". A combat scene is not really a combat scene: It is simply You declaring your attack on me, after which we roll and resolve. Then it's done, adjectives are assigned. Again, done. Then, if it is something that we would call a combat scene, it begins totally anew with the "defender" for the last contention being the attacker for this new contention: Verbs assigned, Push dice assigned, dice rolled, adjectives assigned, then done, Done, DONE. <br/><br/>Our conceptual mess-up was basically thinking that a Contention was a true back-and-forth, and that at the end of step 8 it was NATURALLY the defender's turn to attack (like there's a hidden Step 9, which says "Go back to Step 1, now the defender is the attacker"). If we take the Contention is a true one-way isolated attack action with no reciprocation... maybe that's the conceptual balance we needed to make things work out.<br/><br/>In the street fight above, we literally did do the "OK, they attacked, you lost your eyes. Now it's your turn, what are you doing back at them?" When in truth it should have been "OK, they attacked, you lost your eyes. That contention is Complete, done. Do you want to do anything back to them? It looks like they're just trying to get away more than kill you." <br/><br/>If we were conceptually in that mindset, I think we might have not "Given In", but we might have simply re-assessed the situation more carefully post-Contention, deciding that it was best not to get into a deeper fight and simply let them go. Likewise, for the antagonists around round two, instead of attacking back at our attacks, they might have simply accepted the stickied/permanent adjectives and said "I split".<br/><br/>Not sure if removing yourself from the scene is an option, though. If we Gave In or didn't fight back, they probably would have just left us and ran away. If they gave in or didn't fight back, that likely would have meant "we caught them, they can't escape. Interrogation time." <br/><br/>So bits of this and that aside, I'm starting to think now that some of the issues we had with Giving In might be conceptually still stuck in "rounds of combat/conflict" without stopping clearly between each and re-assessing the situation, maybe.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329311">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329311/#Comment_329311" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-12T22:23:58+00:00" title="June 12, 2011 10:23PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 12, 2011 10:47PM by Jesse.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andy,<br/><br/>I think you have the right of it.  In our post play discussion on Saturday I kept using the phrase, "respect the adjective."  That is, after each time an adjective is inflicted on you, have to STOP and seriously consider the implications.  They can not be considered fleeting moments of color because they are the only mechanism by which narrative change is going to happen.  In other words, the adjective "Bruised" is not about how Indiana Jones looks kind of beat all to hell by the end of the movie but is otherwise operating in top form, instead it's "Jesus, I've just been beaten to hell by a baseball bat.  Am I still going?"<br/><br/>I kind of caught on to this early on.  There was point where some police officials hacked my car to forcibly pull me over.  One of the other PCs wanted to jump up and start trying to counter act the hacking.  But I IMMEDIATELY saw the potential of getting in a very UNFUN loop of escalating adjectives.  The car is "Hacked."  But now they're "Delayed"  Oh, but now the car is "Uncontrolled".  Oh but now they're "Lost" and so on.  So I immediately stopped the other player and just said, "No, the car's hacked, it's pulling over to stop, okay now we're going to do...." and moved on from there.<br/><br/>Have you ever seen any of those stories Ron tells about people pointing to the descriptors in a Sorcerer game to justify their actions.  They say things like, "Well, I'm a Trained Solider so I do X." as if they had to no choice.  To them because they are a Trained Solider they are compelled to act in a certain way.  That's EXACTLY what this game is.<br/><br/>And yes, that means you really can't get passionate about things.  You have to stop and re-evaluate after each adjective and RESPECT them.  This guy is clearly trying to get your character in bed.  He's sweet talked you.  You're now "smitten".  You have stop and re-evaluate.  You have to think, "Huh, I'm smitten.  Is that enough?  Would I go to bed with a guy after being smitten?  No, no, I don't think so."  Then a moment later after buying lots of drinks he hits you "inebriated."  You again, have to stop and consider.  "Huh.  I'm smitten AND inebriated.... is that enough?  Yeah, probably at this point she goes and sleeps with the guy."<br/><br/>So, no, you can't get all passionate about how come hell or high water there is NO WAY she's sleeping with this creep.  You have to look at it with that kind of weird fatalistic eye that leads to strange phrases like, "Well, because he's a Trained Soldier he has to do X".  She's smitten and inebriated, OF COURSE, she goes home with him.  There's no other choice.<br/><br/>Edited Note: I would go so far as to say that if you have to take things to a mechanical force-out that's a pretty good sign that someone at the table got passionate and stopped actively listening to and respecting the actual adjectives being created.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329340">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeremy%20Keller" title="Jeremy Keller"><img alt="Jeremy Keller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://jeremykeller.com/images/me_icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeremy%20Keller">Jeremy Keller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329340/#Comment_329340" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-13T07:29:08+00:00" title="June 13, 2011  7:29AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry it's taken me a while to respond to this thread. I read it yesterday, but didn't have a chance to write a reply because I was being hauled off to my cousin's wedding.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's probably a good thing. I took a lot of time mulling this over yesterday and last night.<br/><br/>First off, thank you Eric for your thoughtful feedback. It's very appreciated that you point out the things you do like along with the things you don't and that you state that some of it is opinion and taste. I couldn't ask for a better rejection of my game.<br/><br/>Thanks Ralph, Andy, and Jesse for weighing in. Lots of good stuff for me to consider.<br/><br/>So, obviously there's a big element to contention that I'm not articulating very well. I think I've given you a lot of pieces to work with, but I've made no clear indication how they're supposed to fit together. Though it sounds like, from Andy and Jesse's comments, that you're starting to get at it anyway. That's cool, but obviously I need to find a way to explain this up front rather than hoping people with reverse engineer the solution after a couple sessions of play. <br/><br/>So, ignoring issues with Push dice economy and death for the moment, I hope you'll let me work some of this out here in order to figure out how I need to fix my text. Or, if it comes down to it, figure out if I need to kill a darling.<br/><br/>One of my design goals within the contention system is to de-couple the achievement of narrative success from the defeating of your enemies. Lots of conflict systems are based on the idea of: 1) set stakes, 2) defeat your enemy, 3) get what you want. Chronica works that way. I have no problem with games working that way. But...<br/><br/>I want a system where you can a) defeat your enemy but still not get what you want and b) get what you want without necessarily defeating your enemy to get it.<br/><br/>So this is where vectors and the narrative truth of adjectives come into play. They are tools to achieve that design. But looking through that chapter, I don't really ever show how it all works together. My running example does a pretty good job of totally avoiding any illustration of how that's supposed to work. Instead, my example focuses on all the backup plans for when the primary system doesn't work. Giving-in, forcing-out, and death are all just safety nets. And I think I forgot to mention that there's a high-wire (or at least I never shine the spotlight on it).<br/><br/>Every time you inflict an adjective, you're moving the narrative one step closer to your goal at that moment. Jesse's phrase of "respecting" the adjective is a great one. If you don't mind, Jesse, I might just steal that from you. Besides whatever mechanical weight might be assigned to an adjective in terms of Hurt dice, the story has to proceed as if that adjective is real. Therefor, you can get what you want through the narrative steps of inflicting adjective without ever having to worry if your enemy gives-in, is forced-out, or killed.<br/><br/>Example: I'm a big thug. There's this guy walking down the street who I want to kidnap. Here are the actions I'm going to take:<br/><br/>\u2022 Slam my hands down on his shoulders to make him <i>grabbed</i>. <br/>\u2022 Throw him over my shoulder, making him <i>carried</i> and lug him over to my hauler truck.<br/>\u2022 Toss him into the cage in the back of my hauler, making him <i>detained</i>.<br/><br/>If those three actions are successful, it doesn't matter if the guy gives or if at some point those Hurt dice he takes force him out, because through the narrative effect of my adjectives I got him off the ground and into my truck. And that was my goal\u2014job done. Because the guy is in a cage and no-longer has any good vectors for attacking, we can drop out of contention mode and see where the story goes from there.<br/><br/>Vectors come into play by limiting what each action can do. Could I have made him <i>detained</i> with one roll? Well, only if he was standing in front of the hauler doors to begin with. Each time you try to achieve something narratively with an adjective, you have to ask yourselves if you can do that with a single action without the target having a chance to struggle back. If not, you just zoom in on a smaller step towards that goal.<br/> <br/>So through that process, the guy has a chance to fight back after each of my actions. He could have struggled free of my <i>grabbed</i>. He could have pulled a gun and shot me. So, like Andy and Jesse are getting at, after every roll you have to look at the adjectives on the table and reconsider your goals. If I got shot, maybe I'm less worried about carrying out the kidnapping and instead am more worried about getting away with my life.<br/><br/>Because goals can change mid-stream like that, I've avoided any straight mechanical metric for success. I don't want to say it takes two adjectives to do this and four adjectives to do that. Because then we would just be playing the game. I want the narrative state to be the metric for success.<br/> <br/>Another example: I'm a hardboiled grifter and I want to meet with an elusive crime boss. It's not easy to get a meeting, so I go up to one of his known goons who is running around town. Right now, the goon's goal is just to run his errand. He doesn't know me from Adam and has no agenda towards me what so ever.<br/><br/>\u2022 I say something mean about the goon's mother, making him <i>insulted</i>.<br/>\u2022 Now that he's been insulted, he has an agenda towards me. He punches me in the gut making me <i>doubled over</i>.<br/><br/>Now this guy's goal is changing. He has to figure out what to do with me. So he decides to take me to his boss and let his boss figure it out. Suddenly his goal is the same is mine. We don't have to play out any more contention, we just advance the narrative to where he throws me in his trunk and brings me to the boss's hideout. New scene.<br/><br/>And what's cool is I made that <i>insulted</i> adjective sticky. So sometime later when the goon and I get into it again, that's still going to be in play.<br/><br/>So one of the reasons that forcing-out statistically takes a long time to ever happen, is just to make sure that there's plenty of time for these narrative stories to play out without forcing-out coming in to complicate matters. And that's part of the reason that giving-in is so arbitrary as well (though I think there's something I can do to fix that process up a bit).<br/><br/>Is that making anything more clear? Are these better examples?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329344/#Comment_329344" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-13T08:01:14+00:00" title="June 13, 2011  8:01AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jeremy,<br/><br/>If I understand you correctly, the adjectives one assigns the opposition are the <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> important bit.

Look at the "recover" action in the Contention Scene section of the Contention chapter. You can act to remove one or more fleeting adjectives from yourself rather than attack.<br/><br/>Sometimes it's just an automatic thing: if someone's knocked you <i>prone</i>, you just take an action to stand up and get rid of it. But if someone is actively maintaining the adjective, like <i>grabbed</i> or <i>carried</i>, then you might need to make a roll to get out of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329359">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329359/#Comment_329359" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-13T08:41:54+00:00" title="June 13, 2011  8:41AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jeremy,<br/><br/>Would it be fair to say that the pacing for contentions is almost entirely adjective-driven?  I mean, my success or failure on my attack roll determines if I get to apply an adjective, but it's really my adjective choice that sets the pace, doesn't it?<br/><br/>For example, my PC is in a foot chase in pursuit of an NPC.  I narrate pausing to fire a couple shots from my pistol at the NPC and get a success on my roll.  Furthermore I roll two Push dice and neither one is removed due to Hurt dice (easy to do in the first round of a contention).  The adjectives "winged", "kneecapped", and "crippled" are all supported by the rules and reasonable results of the situation at hand.  <br/><br/>But each adjective in my example brings the contention closer to it's conclusion than the previous one.

Now that I have a better picture of how you play this game, I can see where we were playing against the grain and how it could be tweaked to keep me interested.  <br/><br/>I would do the following*:<br/><br/>1.  I would make it explicitly clear that their adjectives determine the pacing for the contentions.<br/><br/>2.  Let the defender choose the adjective, not the attacker.  When I fire my gun at the retreating NPC, let the GM determine if they are crippled or winged.  This alters the adjective choice from a statement of "I'm ready to win now" into a statement of "I'm ready to lose now."<br/><br/>2b.  The attacking player should get to choose to spend Push dice for Stickyness or Lock-ness of the adjective after the defender authors it.  <i>"You said 'kneecapped'?  Awesome.  Sticky it.  He's kneecapped for the duration."</i><br/><br/>3.  Strip out all forms of the Give-In rules.  They become redundant when the defending player can assign themselves an adjective that effectively ends the contention.<br/><br/>4.  Strip out the rule about "forced out" due to Hurt dice removing all action and push dice.  I cannot see the sudden and unexpected end to the contention this rule provides doing anything but harming the pacing that players are attempting to provide via adjectives.<br/><br/>5.  Strip out the 3-Push Die Death rule.  In its place, I would discuss with my players the awesome potential for "dead" as an adjective.<br/><br/><br/>*Edited to add this footnote:  It occurred to me that folks could interpret this post to be what I am suggesting Jeremy should do with his game.  That's not my intention.  At least, not directly.  I only suggest what I might do to modifiy the game to suit my tastes and the tastes of my players.  If Jeremy uses what I have to say to alter or improve his text, then cool.

In alot of ways it reminds me of the issues I ran into trying to get my head around Universalis.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheck this:  What you're calling Adjectives Universalis calls Facts.  I actually go on rather ad naseum about Facts and how they're...you know...facts and contrasting that with things that are just Color...or...you know...not Facts.  I'm gonna spin a little psychology speculation here and suggest that maybe part of the issue is that adjectives sound weak (very clever though, I like the verb, adjective, noun thing).  I mean -- in English adjectives are descriptive, they're nice, they make things interesting, but they don't kick you in the balls and make you pay attention.  FACT on the other hand is one of those sledgehammer English words...and that's a Fact.  So possibly some of the problem is just that the label doesn't make the thing sound as important as you really intended it to be...making it easy to gloss over in favor of Push...Push is a much heavier "pay attention to me!" word than "adjective".<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso "Fact" had some mechanical teeth behind it in terms of sorting out the fiction.  In Universalis whenever there is a disagreement about something, being able to point to a "fact" carries explicit mechanical weight.  I realize there's a certain degree of touchy-feely-just-do-it-because-you-want-to inherent in Fiction First type games...but would it be helpful to have some kind of system where a player / GM could specifically call out an adjective and say "no...this"?  Jesse calls it "respect the fiction" which I think is spot on, but sometimes it helps to have the game give you a hammer to help remind your fellow players to do that.  Challenges serve that function in Universalis...even when they're not used they still provide that little extra nudge of "hey, I need to pay attention to that or else I'm going to get challenged".  Their power comes less from actual use than from the self awareness/editing the threat of use engenders in the players.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Or, and this is the other gotcha: Eric pushes the 3 dice to Lisa: "Door dies". Lisa has one Push Die left. She says, "No, I'm still alive" and to do that has to give Eric her Push die. That was Too Easy. Now Eric has *5* Push dice, and can basically turn to the next character who enters a Contention: "3 push dice, you die. Oh you don't? Then give me one of your dice. And now I have 6. 7. 8" and so on. And then we're still left with the conclusion of "needing to pull your punches with the system else PC death is pretty quick and fast as soon as they start tagging NPCs with Sticky/Permanent adjectives.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nI hadn't caught that on a read through, but it makes total sense when its spelled out.  Universalis has a similar mechanic...you can spend your effort adding a bunch of facts to something OR you can just take the guy out.  The key difference is that Universalis the "take a guy out" cost isn't fixed the way 3 Push Dice are fixed.  Its based on Importance.  However many Facts the dude has on him...that's how much it costs to take him out.  So spending the time to give him a "Broken Leg" actually makes it MORE expensive to then eliminate out right...because obviously if you're going to make a Fact out of him having a broken leg that makes the guy more important than you thought he was (its the whole, whoever the camera spends time on is more important idea).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo maybe there's something there you can use...perhaps the Push die cost to just kill a dude needs to be variable.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs another thought, you might want to streamline recovery right into the ordinary rolls.  If you want adjectives to be flying fast and furious...I've grabbed you...I've escaped and am no longer grabbed...I knock your ass down...I stand back up...you don't want the "get rid of the adjective" roll to use different rules or have different restrictions than the "give an adjective" roll.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I don't recall having read it, but can you spend Push dice to throw in a second (or third) adjective in addition to increasing severity?  If not, you may want to consider that.  It would allow for some nice combos including getting rid of a negative adjective "I stand back up" and adding a negative adjective "and punch you in the FACE".<br/>\n<br/>\nAlsox2, The economics of the Push dice confused me a bit.  In order to spend the Push dice for escalating severity...they have to be Push dice that I actually rolled (not just are in my pool)...which means I had to have tagged something in order to roll them in the first place...plus they had to have survived being discarded from Hurt dice...do I have that right?  Is that also how the GM's ability to spend 3 to kill a fool works?  Do they have to be dice that were actually rolled after having come up with 3 tags and not gotten discarded from Hurt?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlsox3, is there any way to force the GM (or another player) to give up Push dice, or is the economy entirely dependent on chosing to increase severity of adjectives?  IIRC there's a way someone can choose to spend Push rather than get hit with a negative adjective, is there a way for me to essentially force you to choose to do that...beyond trying to come up with an outrageous adjective that you couldn't possibly accept.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeremy%20Keller" title="Jeremy Keller"><img alt="Jeremy Keller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://jeremykeller.com/images/me_icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeremy%20Keller">Jeremy Keller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329376/#Comment_329376" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-13T09:42:52+00:00" title="June 13, 2011  9:42AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eric, that's an awesome hack.

When I ran the game this weekend we had a little issue with using treat to remove some adjectives. For example in an encounter with some cops, I gave Jesse's character the adjective suspicious. Jesse wanted to handle this by hacking into the cop's system and removing the incident from their logs. It seemed to make sense so I allowed it. But the way hurt dice work, this adjective affects everything you try to do. The fact that the cops find you suspicious weighs on you. You deal with this by going to someone to take your mind off this (therapist, bartender, escort, etc.). Removing the suspicious adjective is independent of whether or not the cops still think the character is suspicious.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch" title="Will_Hindmarch"><img alt="Will_Hindmarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.wordstudio.net/coffee_ring-32px.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch">Will_Hindmarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329386/#Comment_329386" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-13T10:24:33+00:00" title="June 13, 2011 10:24AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right on, Will.

That makes the decision to at least make something Sticky mid-scene a bigger deal.<br><br>BUT!<br><br>It leads to a problem.  So from what I'm getting Adjectives are not just coloring or details of a situation they ARE the situation.  If I'm Grabbed and it's fleeting there's a hope that I could wriggle out of it.  But if I'm Grabbed and it's Sticky then I can't.<br/><br/>But then what happens when the situation changes in the fiction.  Guy grabs me and makes it sticky then throws me into the back of a car.  I'm no longer grabbed from a fictional point of view but I can't get rid of the adjective until I get a Treat roll.<br/><br/>That makes it harder to Respect adjectives when I'm carrying adjectives that have no literal meaning in the situation any more.  It makes it pretty tough to take Seduced seriously when I'm also carrying Sticky Prone (when I'm clearly standing at the bar) and Sticky Detained (when I'm clearly walking around of my own free will).<br/><br/>Like Will points out above if those are supposed to represent psychological aftermath of that trauma then I think there needs to be a point where they get promoted to psychological adjectives rather than remaining what they were at the time.  Otherwise if I'm going to be ignoring the literalness of Prone during a bar scene then I'm going to be inclined to ignore the literalness of Seduced as well.<br/><br/>Which then leads into a HUGE social problem.  How do you call someone out on not respecting an adjective?  Adjectives are going to mean different things to different people.<br/><br/>A good example is the whole "Hacked" thing on my character's car.  "Hacked" to me, sounded like the car hadn't actually been stopped yet.  That the computer is blinking at me, that a download bar is creeping across the screen but there was still time to do something about it at the computer level.  But from what Will actually described that didn't sound like what he meant.  It sounded an awful lot like he meant the car had Stopped even though he didn't choose that adjective.  I decided to take the most extreme interpretation of the adjective Hacked in order to keep things moving.<br/><br/>This gets way worse when you get into emotional language.  Smitten, Charmed and Seduced are different things and they're even MORE different across different people.  I might put Charmed on someone thinking that's sufficient to win over their trust and confidence but if the other player disagrees what happens?  Can I revise my adjective until I find one that DOES mean that I've won the character over to that individual?  There's suddenly now this huge psychological component.  I have to pick the right word that is going to provoke the behavior I want from a particular player.<br/><br/>Make sense?<br/><br/>Jesse                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329404">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329404/#Comment_329404" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-13T11:45:52+00:00" title="June 13, 2011 11:45AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 13, 2011 11:46AM by Eric Provost.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yikes.

Suffice to say, he is the expert. <br/><br/>For what it's worth, I think a certain amount of authorial, creative interpretation is healthy when playing <i>Technoir</i>. Adjectives gain a lot of their power from their dynamism, but that also makes them hard to adjudicate broadly. Some adjectives require a bit of game-mechanical contortion to operate in a way that agrees with the fiction. I think this may be a place where a lot more discussion, and maybe an essay or two of GM guidance, is better than a rule.

But if I grab him so hard that he's <i>crushed</i>, because I broke a rib or something, then it will warrant being sticky and the Treat roll needed to fix it.<br/><br/>And besides just coming up with the adjective, you're going to need to narrate a bit of your action's consequences to go along with it. <br/><br/>In an early playtest, Ryan Macklin's helicopter pilot/hacker was defending against a SWAT team hacker. The enemy hacker rolled successfully and started bombarding Macklin's character with Facebook friend requests from thousands of dummy accounts. The actual adjective was "popular." The word by itself is pretty meaningless. But as a pointer to the story behind it, which we talked out during play, it was very effective.<br/><br/>So, adjectives aren't exactly FACTS as much as they are shorthand keywords to remind you of the facts you established.<br/><br/>And this is all stuff I need to be more explicit about in the rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329417">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329417/#Comment_329417" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-13T12:24:29+00:00" title="June 13, 2011 12:24PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesse: So, in my previous reads, I took the section on "Vectors" to mean basically "Duh, whatever". /I got this/.

If it was sticky then it's affects linger on you. It doesn't seem like anything is open to interpretation. This has mechanical weight too. If I spend an action to deal with an adjective, then that's one action I'm not using to attack. The adject was and is being respected.<br/><br/>Edit: Yeah pay closer attention to the vectors would help a lot. I took them to be stuff like If I want to shot someone I need to have a gun, but they're more than that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329431">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329431/#Comment_329431" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-13T13:04:15+00:00" title="June 13, 2011  1:04PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: WillH</cite>There is no interpreting your way out of things involved.

Fleeting Grabbed means, yes, I can try to get away.  Sticky Grabbed means, no, his grip is too tight you can't just slip away.<br/><br/>But then you run into all the problems. I outlined above like what happens when he lets go of you willfully.<br/><br/>I LIKE the idea then of having to promote the adjective to something that truly is not a fleeting circumstance if you want to make it sticky.  It also helps keep things focused on all those specific details I was talking about in our discussion.  This a game that requires extremely precise language what what is happening.  Who is doing what.  What is the consequence of having done it.<br/><br/>"I walk up to the woman at the bar and seduce her into coming back to my room" is not good enough.  You've got to tell me step-by-step what you're doing to accomplish that and we have to weigh each adjective.  Is that a here and now thing?  Or is this something that's on-going?  I like that detailing and I think it's the only way the game is actually going to work.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329432/#Comment_329432" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-13T13:07:07+00:00" title="June 13, 2011  1:07PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 13, 2011 1:07PM by Jesse.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: WillH</cite>Edit: Yeah pay closer attention to the vectors would help a lot.

You should be able to use your action to deal with the situation of being grabbed as long as you have a reasonable vector to deal with. Sticky or not should only reflect how long you have to deal how the action affected you.<br/><br/>Edit: How long it affects you emotionally.

What we're saying is that the fact that the guy in the fiction grabs me and that stands on its own and I can respond to it no matter what.  So what I'm saying is that when you promote a Adjective from Fleeting to Sticky you need to promote the content as well from something that is fleeting to something that is sticky.<br/><br/>I'm saying that because just saying "Sticky Grabbed means you're psychologically bothered by the fact you were grabbed" is playing on the same detail level as "I walk up to the bar and seduce the woman."  It doesn't say WHY it bothers me or how it came to bother me so much.  Or for that matter it doesn't indicate if this is a psychological or physical problem.  Because of that it can't inform how I go about treating it or why it trips me up.<br/><br/>It's Vincent's arrows.  I'm suggesting that having to promote the adjective to something actually sticky (and worthy of the treat verb) is how you get from box to cloud.<br/><br/>Is being Grabbed sticky because I'm Embarrassed?  Or feel Violated?  Or just make me Angry?  Or is it because the guy cracked my rib?  I'm going role-play those three VERY differently from each other.<br/><br/>This process solves my whole problem with the Hack thing for Suspicious.  It isn't the fact that cops find me suspicious.  It's because the guy got in my face and reminded me that they are everywhere.  Cameras all over the city.  Taps on my phones.  And now I'm Paranoid.   Which is different from Shaken, for example.  Which I know is what you were saying but because we didn't go through the details I couldn't *see* it, I couldn't *feel* it.  I got what it was supposed to represent but because we didn't actually narrate anything that would warrant my guy having these lingering feelings it didn't make much sense to me.<br/><br/>Going that extra step adds the necessary details to the fiction for determining Vectors and informing the next step of play.  I really do think this is important.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329461">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329461/#Comment_329461" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-13T14:38:48+00:00" title="June 13, 2011  2:38PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm...<br/>\nThis last flurry of posts around fleeting and sticky...as a mechanic, is that perhaps asking for too much careful ajudication to cover something that should be alot more fluid?<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps spending Push dice to increase the severity doesn't work as well in practice as it sounded on paper...because once you've spend a scarce resource to get an effect...you've spent a scarce resource to get an effect...its gotta count or else it was a wasted resource.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut from a "Respect the Fiction" / "Fiction First" stand point it would seem that there'd be numerous times when its time for that adjective to just go away, its no longer of consequence..."but I SPENT a Push Die on it dammit!"<br/>\n<br/>\nThe whole "well you're no longer grabbed but you feel bad about being grabbed...so it still hurts you just as much as it did when you used to be grabbed..." thing, I'm not really buying that.  I can't say I'd ever want to play a character who was that emo about getting grabbed.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe its just as simple as getting that push die back when the fiction over rules the stickiness.  Like the Push die is actually stuck to the negative adjective and is the actual die that gets rolled as Hurt.  When the negative adjective is gone (either because of recovery or fictional necessity) the unstuck Push die rebounds back to the owner...this would be pretty easy to track if each player had their own color of Push Dice.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat way only Locked would require extra thought and you simply wouldn't be able to choose this option unless your adjective was of the "damn near permanent without big time effort" variety.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329466">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WillH" title="WillH"><img alt="WillH" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v488/Telpierion/minitardisicon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WillH">WillH</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329466/#Comment_329466" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-13T15:06:30+00:00" title="June 13, 2011  3:06PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>It doesn't say WHY it bothers me or how it came to bother me so much.</blockquote>\nOK, this is just a style difference I guess.

                 I think it's important that the attacker (especially when players are attacking) has authority of the inflicted adjective so that they can achieve effects that reflect their original intents. There is a lot of strategy in what adjective you inflict and I'd rather not lose that.<br/><br/>Thought experiment:<br/><br/>We get rid of give-ins, take-outs, and 3-Push killing. Adjective authority stays with the attacker. <br/><br/>What if the defender is able to buy adjective authority from the attacker by paying one of her Push dice (which can be one of the ones just paid to her for a sticky or locked adjective) back? Her new adjective still has to be a logical consequence of the attacker's action and it still has to be at the severity he originally payed for.<br/><br/><b>Attacker:</b> (sliding two Push dice to the defender) I shoot you in the eye, you are <i>blind</i>.<br/><b>Defender:</b> (sliding one of the Push dice back) Actually, you got me in the shoulder. I'm <i>maimed</i>.<br/><br/>This give the defender some level of protection from being completely subject to an attacker's whims. And the only time she is completely vulnerable to an attacker's adjective is when she is out of Push dice and the inflicted adjective is only fleeting (which she can then get rid of on her turn if she wants). If it's sticky or locked, the attacker gives her the currency to buy authority with. And ideally the attacker would pull their punches because, well, wouldn't they want one of those Push dice back?<br/><br/>Any thoughts?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329609">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WillH" title="WillH"><img alt="WillH" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v488/Telpierion/minitardisicon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WillH">WillH</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329609/#Comment_329609" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-14T09:17:42+00:00" title="June 14, 2011  9:17AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 14, 2011 9:18AM by WillH.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jeremy Keller</cite>What if the defender is able to buy adjective authority from the attacker by paying one of her Push dice (which can be one of the ones just paid to her for a sticky or locked adjective) back?</blockquote>\nJeremy, I don't think this is a good idea for the normal back and forth in a contention, but it would be an interesting replacement for giving in. You're faced with an adjective you don't, and in exchange for giving in you get some authorial control over the adjective. Maybe you could also opt to lessen the severity, e.g. locked becomes sticky, but the attacker keeps the authority to decide what the adjective is.<br/><br/>As for 3-Push killing, I don't see a problem with it. If you have three push dice to spend, you can kill your opponent, great. Is the character willing to kill this person to get what they want? Will killing the person get them what they want? Unless the answer to both of those questions is yes, deciding not to kill is no more pulling your punches than deciding not to strangle your coworker who takes the last cup of coffee without starting a new pot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329610">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329610/#Comment_329610" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-14T09:20:19+00:00" title="June 14, 2011  9:20AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Thank you so much for sharing your feedback publicly, Eric! </blockquote>\nMy pleasure.  I'm glad I've been helpful.<br/><br/><br/>Jeremy,<br/><br/>I like where you're going with your new mechanism proposal.  It's very interesting.<br/><br/>However, after spending a bit of time mulling it over yesterday, I think I may have to step back from the Technoir feedback table.  I just do not think I would enjoy pacing a conflict with adjectives.  It's just not what I want from my gaming.  Which means that I've kind of run out of feedback of any value.  I don't want anyone to think I've abandoned the threads, but I don't want to be the guy who makes empty posts just to stay in the conversation either.  I'll be keeping up with what's going on here, mostly because there's so much about the game that I do enjoy.

At the end of the day it's your game.  I think that when you promote a adjective to sticky you have to promote the adjective as well as narrate the fiction that justifies that promotion.  Will seems to think Sticky Grabbed is just fine.  At the end of the day, only YOU can decide which you think expresses what you from the game best.<br/><br/>That said, I'd like to offer up some thoughts on the 3-die kill/pulling punches thing.  I'm beginning to wonder if Stakes setting thinking isn't clouding up the waters.  Consider this.  The PCs have a box that some assassins want.  As the GM I have three push dice when my assassins show up.<br/><br/>What I think is happening is people are thinking this: If I'm really and truly committed to getting the box and I don't want to pull my punches then what I do is use three push die on each action.  After each action a PC is either dead or out of the contention and I'm up a die.  Once all PCs are eliminated I get the box, because that's what the contention was over.<br/><br/>But if I understand you correctly that's not what happens.  All that does is end the scene because when the PC carrying box was death-ed out of the contention when he spent his push die to actually live he could just narrate that he runs away with the box.<br/><br/>If I actually want the box then I have to get it step by step.  I shoot you, you're Prone.  I rip the box from your hands, you're Robbed.  etc.<br/><br/>So I think the real problem is the idea that a Contention is something like Duel of Wits.  Right now it seems like a Contention is a process that you're in and when it's over something has been won or lost definitively.  But it doesn't seem like that's the case at all.  It seems like really, each die roll is it's own action with it's own consequences and the game is built from those actions.  The Give-Ins and Force-Outs are mechanisms by which people simply stop participating rather than actually achieve anything.<br/><br/>Do I have the right of it?<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch" title="Will_Hindmarch"><img alt="Will_Hindmarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.wordstudio.net/coffee_ring-32px.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch">Will_Hindmarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329719/#Comment_329719" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-14T15:02:05+00:00" title="June 14, 2011  3:02PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>Just a reminder: Don't get too caught up in trying to make any of us happy.

I think it can probably be narrated into the fiction in a way that makes a sticky grab make sense. (Maybe it involves cyberarms or a power-loader device.) But I agree that the narrative's information is vital to making the game turn. <i>Technoir</i> is a language for phrasing and parsing and reconciling action. Sometimes even ungrammatical statements will emerge that are easily understood. Sometimes grammatical statements may emerge that don't adequately express what we want.<br/><br/>The trick might be that <i>Technoir</i> needs to help readers to think like <i>Technoir</i> thinks. The rules, alone, don't do that yet. But I'm thinking out loud right now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329721">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329721/#Comment_329721" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-14T15:04:13+00:00" title="June 14, 2011  3:04PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Will Hindmarch</cite>To be more clear about my position, I think it's potentially fine.</blockquote>\nI've been talking about the OTHER Will.

It's so statistically improbable that I don't think it's ever come up in anyone else's game. That was by design. Force-outs were always supposed to be a back-door way out of a contention scene if you had a player who was clearly out-matched but would never give in.<br/><br/>Give-ins happen a lot more often, but only once has a player ever gave-in in one of my games. All of my NPCs have always given in when appropriate to the narrative: which is really just respecting the fiction.<br/><br/>So I think if I get rid of give-ins and force-outs, it doesn't really change the game as I've been playing it and it helps to disassociate the system from a conflict resolution for stakes system. (Of course I also need to better address up front that applying adjectives and respecting that fiction is the method by which you resolve these things.)<br/><br/>The 3 Push kill is another story. I've never used it as a GM. The players use it occasionally. It's kind of rare that (unless it's the first roll of the game) a player has 3 Push dice, includes them all in the roll, and is then willing to spend them all. But it's effective if there's some jerk you really want to get rid of.<br/><br/>So I'm still not 100% sure on getting rid of that. If I do, I need to find another way for death to happen. I just want to make sure it's a last resort thing and not an any-time-you-have-the-opportunity to thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329728">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeremy%20Keller" title="Jeremy Keller"><img alt="Jeremy Keller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://jeremykeller.com/images/me_icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeremy%20Keller">Jeremy Keller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329728/#Comment_329728" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-14T15:26:28+00:00" title="June 14, 2011  3:26PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and I think I'm going to stop using "contention" as a unit of measure in the game.

Right now it seems like a Contention is a process that you're in and when it's over something has been won or lost definitively.  But it doesn't seem like that's the case at all.  It seems like really, each die roll is it's own action with it's own consequences and the game is built from those actions.  The Give-Ins and Force-Outs are mechanisms by which people simply stop participating rather than actually achieve anything.</blockquote>\nWhen we played earlier today I saw a little of what Jesse is talking about. Players trying to wrap a contention up into a single goal statement and a roll because they aren't in the mindset of "what particular action do I have to take first in order to achieve my desired result?" Basically, if you try to compress any of the fiction during a contention then I think it likely that your fiction will not integrate with the mechanics in a satisfying way. You MAY be able to get the desired result in a single roll, but going into a contention with a "one-roll-to-goal" assumption will probably result in glossing over the fiction in detrimental ways and end up mangling the discrete action to discrete action chain.<br/><br/>It helps I think, as the GM, to sort of telegraph the general state and intentions of the opposition before and during a contention. This can help set the level of fictional granularity you're going for in the contention and help players focus on the blow-by-blow and stay in the moment. If you don't really know what your opponent is doing or might do next or what resources might be brought to bear against you then there's not a lot to react to and keep you in the moment.<br/><br/>The game seems to work best using discrete actions. The outcomes and narrative of that action (including adjectives) plays directly into what discrete action is taken next. Maybe you'll achieve your goal with that single action, maybe not and you'll have to keep at it or try a different way. In this way Technoir strikes me very much as a game that plays well when run in the same manner I run an old school D&amp;D game. But with newer tech, of course.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329745">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329745/#Comment_329745" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-14T15:54:59+00:00" title="June 14, 2011  3:54PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 14, 2011 4:06PM by John_Harper.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oooh, your answer to Jesse is very interesting, Jeremy!

Are you saying that mechanically, your NPCs are usually outmatched, so that the system itself results in them having a greater number of more severe adjectives placed upon them, and therefore they give? <br/><br/>Or do you mean that you are actually playing a slightly modified game than your players, in which you decide to have your NPCs 'succumb to the fiction' more easily in order to produce the story you expect? And that if you didn't play this game, your players' PCs would end up crippled, quivering wrecks, brimming with life-destroying permanent adjectives? Like, is there a different meaning for 'appropriate to the narrative' for NPCs than for PCs, when you play?<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>In general I am struggling to get my head around what 'pacing with adjectives' might actually look like, if everyone involved is playing as hard as they can within the fiction -- the question about what 'giving in' could mean in a system which has since been fairly explicitly described as not involving any stakes is particularly weird. It sounds like 'giving in' is simply synonymous with 'not initiating a follow-up round', since it doesn't let you avoid the threatened consequences (as in Dogs) but is instead <i>the result of them</i>. And if those threatened consequences are the primary unit of play during a contention, and it is a mistake to worry about larger stakes outside of 'respecting the adjectives' -- it sounds like giving in is no longer a relevant concept. It's just one of many in-fiction things someone might do after considering their latest adjective. (Edit: and I see that Ludanto already basically said this, much more succinctly!)<br/><br/>To be honest, I think a lot of my confusion has to do with the increasingly-awkward need to substantiate <i>all fictional consequences</i> as negative adjectives placed on an NPC. That's probably just a language thing, but consider the footrace example above -- what's my best adjective, there, if my guy is just faster? Do I make the other guy 'caught-up-to'? Or maybe 'too slow'? Or how about 'pwn3d in a footrace'? Because what I want in the fiction is super obvious: I want to have caught up to the guy. That has nothing to do with his state of being; it doesn't have to harm him at all, or permanently scar his soul; I'm not enacting ontological surgery on this guy, I am just trying to establish a very straightforward fact in the narrative. But it turns out that it feels way more straightforward to shoot him in the leg and permanently 'cripple' him than it does to just run faster than him, even though both are mechanically identical. <br/><br/>The only thing that makes one seem easier is the language involved, and the awkwardness of representing a positive capability of my character through a negative adjective applied to someone else. But I mean, if you've followed this so far: what happens if we modify the example a little bit and now I am trying to outrun four different people? Do I have to outrun them all separately, one roll at a time? Why can't I just put a new positive adjective on myself -- like, say, 'fastest motherfucker on the block', or 'definitely-getting-away' -- to represent my achievement in the fiction? <br/><br/>If we don't have stakes and everything is achieved through a negative adjective inflicted on a single NPC, lots of stuff suddenly starts to feel way more difficult than it probably should be. And the conflation of fleeting adjectives (aka. 'how things happen in the fiction') with the rules for injury (aka. 'how people getting hurt in the fiction is modelled in the mechanics') starts to look like a major thematic statement. I.e. to get something done you have to hurt someone else.<br/><br/>This is a tangent of course, especially if what was said above about how the tags are not actually <i>constitutive</i> of the fiction, but instead <i>representative</i> of a larger and more complex consequence (that was explained at the time.) At that point the game starts to sound a lot more like Apocalypse World, in that 'inflicting an adjective' becomes code for 'narrating what happens as the result of what I just did... and then once I do that we'll think of an adjective for you.' Which is fine, and in fact feels relatively straightforward, but is certainly not my starting assumption after reading the rules and the first half of this thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329798/#Comment_329798" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-14T20:14:01+00:00" title="June 14, 2011  8:14PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We'll see how it plays out, but until I hear better I think I'm going to allow Fleeting AoE if it's fictionally reasonable.

Which is fine, and in fact feels relatively straightforward, but is certainly not my starting assumption after reading the rules and the first half of this thread.</blockquote>\nAll fictional consequences aren't encapsulated in negative adjectives. The fiction has its own weight, its own repercussions on play. Negative adjectives are discrete bits of fiction given additional weight by the mechanics. In your footrace example, even a basic success where you spend no Push dice will allow you to give your opponent a fleeting adjective like <i>outpaced</i> or <i>surpassed</i>. That would necessitate your opponent using his action to do something that would neutralize the negative fleeting adjective. Depending on the length of the race and if your opponent recovers that one fleeting adjective might be enough to win. Maybe you could spend two Push dice to give him that sticky <i>pwned</i> adjective and win the race flat out. Maybe you and your group decide that <i>pwned</i> is a fleeting adjective because the loss won't cause your opponent any serious ego bruising. There is no hard rule or formula that can account for every situation or perspective. You and your group need to evaluate the fiction and handle the assignation of adjectives accordingly.<br/><br/>There's a spectrum of results:<br/><br/><b>~</b>action is ineffective on a failed roll (the action was achieved narratively but had no noticeable effect)<br/><br/><b>~</b>action has temporary effect on a successful roll (fleeting adjective)<br/><br/><b>~</b>action has lingering effect on a successful roll and spending one Push die (sticky adjective)<br/><br/><b>~</b>action has permanent effect on successful roll and spending two Push dice (locked adjective)<br/><br/>The weight of the change on the fiction is directly proportional to the weight of the mechanics (roll result + Push dice spent) applied to the fiction. The adjectives being assigned not only need to fit within their vector of application but also need to fit within their place on that spectrum of effect, fictionally AND mechanically. This is why making an adjective like <i>grabbed</i> sticky isn't going to sit quite right most of the time. We recognize being grabbed as a condition that is prone to rapid change.<br/><br/>If you use the mechanics to force an effect on the fiction you're going to be in for a struggle. The fiction has to be created and then the mechanics applied to fit. Before you even pick up the the dice you describe the action you're taking, and you probably have an idea of the immediate result you want to achieve with that action. But you have to be flexible when it comes to describing the results of your roll and how you use and spend Push dice. You may intend to spend 2 Push dice but if you lose one or both of them due to Hurt dice results then you're going to have to alter the narrative result of your action to fit what you're now capable of inflicting mechanically. In this way you move, action by action, towards some ultimate result.<br/><br/>The description of your action, your opponent's defense description, any adjective inflicted, any Push dice spent, and any description of the result of your action should all be in harmony with each other. One should flow naturally from the next. It is up to you and your group to determine where edge cases fall. Much of the time a fleeting adjective will give you the result you want. Other times it may take a sticky adjective. It depends on your conception of the fiction and needs to be taken into account when you narrate or describe actions.<br/><br/>When it comes to showing your character's capability with negative adjectives applied to your opponent Technoir is solidly in the category of "results show your capability, verb ratings and positive adjectives show your potential." You use that potential by giving your opponents negative adjectives which in turn shows your degree of capability.<br/><br/>That's my take, hope it helps.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329899/#Comment_329899" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-15T08:49:48+00:00" title="June 15, 2011  8:49AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Jeremy, these last few posts have me thinking.

You have a sprained ankle in the fiction regardless, right? So you would then play that off with the nurse in an attempt to make her <i>sympathetic</i>. The system being very selective in how adjectives are created, categorized, and applied is a good thing I'm thinking. It says that this adjective is distinct/potent in relation to the fiction and has a  mechanical effect when applied this way, but not when applied this other way. Also, leaving the creation of positive adjectives for Set-Up and Aid maneuvers makes teamwork and effecting your environment mechanically a big deal.<br/><br/>That's my initial gut reaction though and I reserve the right to totally change my mind. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329990/#Comment_329990" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-15T13:03:46+00:00" title="June 15, 2011  1:03PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chris...the system monkey part of my brain loves what you just said.

I'm not seeing any extra mechanical manipulation in the example you used. If <i>sprained</i> is considered a positive adjective under the circumstances it allows you to roll a Push die when you integrate it into your narration and gives you a better shot at making the nurse <i>sympathetic</i>. If <i>sprained</i> only works as a negative then it doesn't apply to the situation mechanically at all. You can use the situation of having a sprained ankle as the basis for trying to evoke sympathy in the Nurse, but it doesn't effect the odds of your roll or the strength of the adjective you can apply to the nurse.<br/><br/>Not being able to flip adjectives looks like it is actually mechanically more simple to me. That's not the only dynamic to consider of course and I agree that it is possible to engender sympathy with a sprained ankle as your primary weapon.

ASSEMBLE THE DICE<br/>\u25b6\u25b6 As the attacker describes the action her character is performing, she<br/>selects the verb that best governs that action. She might even use the<br/>verb itself in the description, putting emphasis on the word to indicate<br/>the one she\u2019s using to the rest of the table. Then she picks up a number<br/>of Action dice equal to her character\u2019s rating in that verb.<br/><br/>\u25b6\u25b6<b> She may add a charged Push dice for each positive adjective or object<br/>tag she works into the description that aids her in the action.</b> She can<br/>add all of her Push dice this way, but she may want to save some of<br/>them for defensive purposes if someone attacks her between now and<br/>her next attack.<br/><br/>\u25b6\u25b6 For each negative adjective on her protagonist sheet, she adds a Hurt<br/>die. She must ensure her action is something reasonable given her neg-<br/>ative adjectives.</blockquote>\nRather than working positive adjectives into the action description there was a tendency to want to describe first, decide to use Push dice, then go back and justify adjectives and therefore Push dice base upon the narration. It can work this way but it goes much more smoothly when keeping your adjectives in mind during your initial action description. We got it sorted out quickly but it wouldn't hurt to emphasize the order here.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Page 72 Technoir Beta</cite><br/>4. DETERMINE DEFENSE<br/>\u25b6\u25b6 <b>The person playing the target character describes what he is doing in<br/>defense and selects the verb that governs that action.</b> The verb\u2019s rating<br/>is his base defensive rating.<br/><br/>\u25b6\u25b6 For each positive adjective or object tag that helps his defense, he can<br/>discharge a charged Push die to increase his defensive rating by 1. He<br/>can\u2019t use a tag that is trumped by a tag the attacker used (see page XX).<br/></blockquote>\nNarrating what you're doing in defense after your attacker has already rolled felt strange at first. One reason is that you know after the attacker's roll whether you even have a chance of successfully defending or not. I got used to it, which is good, because the inclusion of the defensive action narration shapes and gives context to the attacker's following narration and any adjective inflicted upon you. This could really use some instruction, similar to that for describing the outcome of the attacking action in step 5, to give the player some idea of the bounds within which to frame the defense action narration. We hit it mostly right, but some more guidance would have helped I felt.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Page 72 Technoir Beta</cite><br/>5. RESOLVE THE ROLL<br/>\u25b6\u25b6 If the attacker\u2019s result (including a \u2018.1\u2019) is higher than the target\u2019s defen-<br/>sive rating, the attacker can inflict a fleeting adjective of her choosing<br/>on the target. <b>She describes the outcome of the attack only so far as to<br/>warrant that adjective, nothing more.</b><br/><br/>\u25b6\u25b6 If the attacker\u2019s result was equal to or less than the target\u2019s defensive<br/>rating, the attack happened as described but was not effective enough<br/>to inflict a new adjective. In this case, if the attacker is a player, she<br/>should mark the circle next to the verb she used in the attack. This verb<br/>is now primed.<br/></blockquote>\nThis turned out to be a key instruction. Particularly for IRC play, but I suspect for play in general. Violating this rule can result in skipping past the very situation that you're trying to resolve and moving past important opportunity points for subsequent attackers. It also tends to negate space for the GM to add in important details and color.<br/><br/>If anybody else has some experience or thoughts about these aspects they'd like to share I would love to hear them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_330195">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330195/#Comment_330195" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-16T09:22:10+00:00" title="June 16, 2011  9:22AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 16, 2011 3:40PM by Valamir.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: C.

I'm not seeing any extra mechanical manipulation in the example you used. If<i>sprained</i>is considered a positive adjective under the circumstances it allows you to roll a Push die when you integrate it into your narration and gives you a better shot at making the nurse<i>sympathetic</i>. If<i>sprained</i>only works as a negative then it doesn't apply to the situation mechanically at all. You can use the situation of having a sprained ankle as the basis for trying to evoke sympathy in the Nurse, but it doesn't effect the odds of your roll or the strength of the adjective you can apply to the nurse.<br/><br/>Not being able to flip adjectives looks like it is actually mechanically more simple to me. That's not the only dynamic to consider of course and I agree that it is possible to engender sympathy with a sprained ankle as your primary weapon. I just don't see what is gained by making that a mechanical thing in the game.<br/><br/>I'm not sure I follow you.<br/><br/>Lets say I'm flirting with a cute nurse.  Lets say I want to hit her with the adjective "Smitten"...for whatever story relevant reason that this would be an important thing to do.<br/><br/>On my sheet I have "Sprained Ankle"<br/><br/>Your way (from post 76 on my list):  I narratively use the fact that I have a sprained ankle to justify my Vector for hitting the nurse with a "Sympathetic" adjective.  I then tag the Sympathetic adjective to help me on my quest to hit her with "Smitten" (or whatever).<br/><br/>My way:  skip that extra roll, and just go directly to tagging "sprained ankle" because, from a position of respecting the fiction, it makes sense that that adjective could be used to my advantage in that situation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeremy%20Keller" title="Jeremy Keller"><img alt="Jeremy Keller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://jeremykeller.com/images/me_icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeremy%20Keller">Jeremy Keller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330202/#Comment_330202" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-16T09:53:56+00:00" title="June 16, 2011  9:53AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry I haven't responded over the last couple of days. I really appreciate that people are giving so many thoughtful suggestions. <br/><br/>I'm going to defend the game as it stands a bit. I hope this doesn't come across as me "getting all defensive." It's not my intention to shut out any feedback. I just want to talk this out a little bit.<br/><br/>I got to play a session last night. Play, mind you, not GM. So awesome when I get to play my own game.<br/><br/>We tried a few changes. We got rid of Give-in, Force-outs, and Killing. Instead, they naturally got replaced with give-ins, force-outs, and killing that happened naturally out of the narration. That part felt good. It's going to take some explaining on my part to get GMs and players on the same page for that, obviously. Maybe those rules get reintroduced, but with a softer sell in a subsection of the rules. But the key thing for me is that they will be taken out of the procedure outline so that they don't confuse the primary mode of play: inflicting adjectives to progress the fiction.<br/><br/>We also tried giving adjective authority to the defender. This idea grew on me over the last couple of days. In thinking it out, it created some really interesting implications. It means the attacker has to be really explicit with her action if she wants to create particular consequences. Just saying "I shoot him" isn't good enough. She has to create enough narration to limit what adjectives the defender can choose. I love mechanics that naturally encourage more narration like that. It also represents some sort of inherent agreement between the attacker and defender over what happened in the fiction.<br/><br/>In practice, it didn't work. Well, it didn't work for <i>us</i>. It might be just because we're used to the other way now. But I think there's a particular strength in having the attacker narrating the effect of their actions and naming that adjective. It allows for more confident talk at the table.<br/><br/>Mind you, either way, we still do a lot of group brainstorming as to what the adjective should be. We shout out different synonyms and metaphors until we find one that entertains us the most. So it really shouldn't be that different that the defender has final authority rather than the attacker. But it just seemed like it required this extra step of negotiation we hadn't needed before and it slowed down play. Again, maybe it's because we're not used to it.<br/><br/>But what I learned is we're really enjoying the game we've been playing. There isn't a need to change it much. It's fun for us. It allows us to tell these amazing stories. I'm assuming it will be fun for others if I can figure out how to best communicate it and get them playing the same game we are. I'll be able to do that better with my next draft of the text. Better, but never perfect. And I realize I can't make everyone happy.<br/><br/>That doesn't mean you shouldn't drift and hack the hell out of it if you want to.<br/><br/>As to Ralph's suggestion about adjectives and getting rid of the positive and negative indicators: the design went down that road at one point and it didn't work out well. What it comes down to is that the three positive adjectives and the plethora of tags you have are usually plenty. The limiting factor is the Push dice. I've thought about treating negative adjectives as positive, tagging other character's adjectives and tags, having positive adjectives attached to locations and events, creating additional adjectives on the scene and all sorts of things to give you more stuff to work with. To paraphrase Ralph, all that sounds really awesome just typing it out. But in play, that just turns out that's a lot of book keeping. It's enough to look through your three positive adjectives and your list of tags to find stuff to spend Push on.<br/><br/>As to negative adjectives, the reason they're clearly delineated as negative is to make sure there's not confusion over whether you roll Hurt dice for them or not. I don't want to slow down play with having to decide which adjectives are hindering your actions and which ones aren't. You roll Hurt dice for each negative adjective you have, period. Roll dice and move the story forward. I realize there's sometimes going to be a disconnect ("Why does my <i>hacked</i> submachine gun hinder me from coaxing this guy?") but there's going to be problems with any abstractions. There's a couple of moves like recover and ditch that give you a way to deal with that.<br/><br/>(Plus, the way the dice mechanics work, the Hurt die from your <i>hacked</i> gun only has a chance of penalizing your highest result from your roll\u2014it's not like it's a definite penalty.)<br/><br/>Changing the terms from sticky and locked to damaging and permanent doesn't work. That's also something I tried. Damaging doesn't apply well to positive adjectives (I'd rather not have to use separate severity terms for positive and negative) and permanent isn't actually permanent. As much as I would like more evocative terms, those are the ones that have proved the best over time.<br/><br/>I am damn sorry if I sound dismissive of anyone's ideas. You don't know how much it means to me that you're interested enough in the game to help out. Even if I can't use your suggestions, your feedback is really helping me in showing me where I need to be better organized and clear in the text.

I think that whether or not your sprained-ankle can be used to narrate taking the nurse straight to <i>smitten</i>, and not bothering with getting her to <i>sympathetic</i> first, has nothing to do with being able to tap the sprain as a positive adjective. If it makes sense to narrate it that way then it does, period, and using <i>sprained</i> as a positive adjective only lets you add mechanical weight to your attempt to make the nurse <i>smitten</i>.<br/><br/>There is the aspect Jeremy brought up though of taking every negative adjective, related to your action in an obvious way or not, as a Hurt die on your roll. Which could make <i>sprained</i> work against your attempt to make the nurse <i>smitten</i>. Narratively, I can see it working as a bane or boon either way. It shouldn't be a big deal to ignore that rule and only apply negative adjectives, and Hurt dice, to a roll where it makes sense to you. I may do the same, but I'm going to try it by the book first. I'm already thinking of interesting ways that a <i>hacked</i> gun could negatively effect a Coax roll.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WillH" title="WillH"><img alt="WillH" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v488/Telpierion/minitardisicon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WillH">WillH</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330239/#Comment_330239" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-16T11:47:06+00:00" title="June 16, 2011 11:47AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jeremy Keller</cite><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>What you just said, might very telling.

I make the protagonists work hard and sacrifice to get what they want.<br/><br/>So it seem like the GM's job isn't necessarily to provide opposition to the characters, but to hurt the characters.

That is are they allowed to narrate brutally devastating results but leave the Adjective fleeting?  Or in your games is the narration and expenditure of Push dice more tied more closely than that.<br/><br/>For example, can I describe my gun blast totally taking half a dude's face off but leave the adjective as Fleeting "Injured."  Or would you say, "No, if you want to take the guy's face off that's at least a Sticky Adjective of some kind."<br/><br/>Because if severity of outcome (and I'm talking pure visuals here) is actually tied to expenditure of Push dice then the Push dice are going to move around the table A LOT faster than they were in our game.  Because when we played it visual severity was completely decoupled from adjective permanence.  That is I could totally maim a guy, right here, right now, but if I didn't care if that persisted past right here, right now, I didn't spend any push dice.  The assumption being that if the guy came back he would just have all these wicked scars or bandages but he didn't actually have to make Treat rolls or anything like that.<br/><br/>But if I actually, have to spend dice to get the narrative result I want, that's a whole other game.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330247">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeremy%20Keller" title="Jeremy Keller"><img alt="Jeremy Keller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://jeremykeller.com/images/me_icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeremy%20Keller">Jeremy Keller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330247/#Comment_330247" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-16T12:35:03+00:00" title="June 16, 2011 12:35PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: WillH</cite>So it seem like the GM's job isn't necessarily to provide opposition to the characters, but to hurt the characters.

I don't get too worried about defeating the players, because the whole thing is usually an uphill battle for them. The powerful factions get what they want, off screen, all the time. The scenes they play are a chance for them to inch uphill, fight, and sacrifice for what they want. At least that's how our stories have worked out so far. Other narrative structures could work, I'm sure.<br/><br/>I haven't played with the Push dice reversed at the start, though I have wound up with a lot of Push dice at some points. The issue is you want to teach the players how to use their adjectives and tags with their first actions. That's made easier by them having Push dice. Once you're more used to the system, you can change up the starting configuration as much as you want, but I like that the players are in control of escalation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_330248">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeremy%20Keller" title="Jeremy Keller"><img alt="Jeremy Keller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://jeremykeller.com/images/me_icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeremy%20Keller">Jeremy Keller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330248/#Comment_330248" name="Item_89" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-16T12:39:59+00:00" title="June 16, 2011 12:39PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>Or would you say, "No, if you want to take the guy's face off that's at least a Sticky Adjective of some kind."</blockquote>\nThis is exactly what I say.

The players didn't want to spend push if they didn't think they would see the NPC again and I wasn't willing to budge on the NPC's position because the players were not doing anything that would have a lasting effect on the NPC.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_330253">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330253/#Comment_330253" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-16T13:01:11+00:00" title="June 16, 2011  1:01PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jeremy,<br/><br/>Neat.  I'd like to suggest that your game works in a *very specific* GM/Player dynamic play space.  I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing but I suggest you take some time to reflect on the actual social/creative dynamics at the table and spell things out.<br/><br/>The fact that NPCs mostly accomplish things off screen but PCs almost always make progress on screen is actually kind of HUGE.  If suggests that the game is best played with an asymmetrical agenda between GM and and Players.  Players push for their goals but the GM is simply trying to do as much damage as possible before inevitably being taken out.  Real consequential achievement by the NPCs is done off screen when the PCs don't have opportunities to interfere.<br/><br/>I think that's a more important creative dynamic than you might think.  I'm pretty sure the game doesn't work if both sides are 100% committed to achieving their goals only willing to quit when the mechanics say they can't fight anymore.  When that happened at our table the game was an unfun grind.  It sounds like that's what happened to Eric and Andy as well.<br/><br/>If it helps consider (and maybe playtest) this situation.  The PCs are holed up somewhere protecting an injured NPC.  A bunch of bad guys show up with the intention of kidnapping the injured NPC.  As the GM really, truly commit to kidnapping that NPC.  Don't give up just because the PC does something cool that "should be" the winning move of the game.  Think of your NPCs just as badass as any hero in any action movie.  He gets his leg blown off?  No sweat, he just ties it off and keeps limping in there....<br/><br/>I can almost guarantee the scene won't work very well.  It will never end.  No one will simply "bow out".  I suggest that the game largely works because of the GM's willingness to bow out once someone has done something suitably cool to bring the scene to a close.<br/><br/>Note: That's perfectly fine, if you're happy with that.  I'm just pointing it out and you should devote some time in your text to it.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeremy%20Keller" title="Jeremy Keller"><img alt="Jeremy Keller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://jeremykeller.com/images/me_icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeremy%20Keller">Jeremy Keller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330257/#Comment_330257" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-16T13:09:03+00:00" title="June 16, 2011  1:09PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, it's important that the players know that they want to give you Push dice.

I could completely jack somebody up and choosing to not make it sticky just means the next time we see them they will have recovered or any lingering signs of the trauma are purely narrative cosmetics with no mechanical backing.<br/><br/>That's why I was very confused by Will's reaction of having his NPCs react as if they were AWARE that the Adjectives were fleeting.

As Khambiz went to enter the room one of the NPCs hiding almost behind the door tried to grab him. Khambiz defended successfully then used his attack action to leverage his opponent's momentum and pull him out into the hall and into the arms of Francis, giving the NPC a fleeting <i>controlled</i> adjective. I have the other NPC fire through the doorway at Khambiz. Khambiz, in defense, tries to spin out from in front of the doorway but he can't muster enough Move defense. I have no Push dice so I give Khambiz a fleeting <i>grazed</i> adjective. Francis then uses the NPC he has controlled as a meatshield, twisting into the doorway, dropping to his knees, and firing between the guy's legs at the NPC inside the room. I have my guy use his Move to dive behind the bed, but without Push dice and against the high roll for Francis, the defense fails (which I knew it would based on the high roll for Francis, no matter what defense I used the guy was getting plugged). The NPC is shot, spraying blood against the wall of the room as he finishes his dive behind the bed. The player spends a Push die to give the NPC a sticky <i>incapacitated</i> adjective. The player originally was going to spend both Push dice he rolled for the <i>incapacitated</i> adjective, but I reiterated the difference between sticky and locked adjectives and we decided that spending 1 Push die for incapacitated would work just fine for the effect he wanted. <br/><br/>We had to stop play right there, but now I have a little ammo, 1 Push die, to use if I decide that the controlled NPC wants to try and bust free and make a run for it next time we play.<br/><br/>I have some concerns that <i>incapacitated</i> may be a little vague but I'm going with it to see how it plays out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_330307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WillH" title="WillH"><img alt="WillH" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v488/Telpierion/minitardisicon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WillH">WillH</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330307/#Comment_330307" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-16T16:57:35+00:00" title="June 16, 2011  4:57PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>Dude, I just blew this guy's fucking knee off.

adjective like it's a positive one when appropriate. The small scope of the Push economy will make sure that doesn't get out of hand.<br/><br/>What's problematic is for me to teach the rules that way. It just confuses the issue and I think it's better suggested as a hack rather than put forth as a core rule.</blockquote>\nMore problematic to me is the idea that in the example with the nurse, my sprained ankle is actually <i>hurting</i> my chances to succeed at Coaxing her. This becomes even more strange if we follow your advice here, and allow it to be tagged as a positive. Though actually the fact that my submachine gun is <i>hacked</i> also making it harder to Coax the nurse is even more bizarre. I was operating under the impression that only applicable negative adjectives would be rolled as Hurt dice, in the same way only applicable positive adjectives can be used to get Push dice. Would that really require significantly more handling time on the part of the players? Because the benefit to fictional consistency seem pretty clear -- sure, mostly that <i>hacked</i> Hurt die won't have a significant effect, but when it does I'm going to be expending quite a bit of effort trying to figure out what the looked like in the fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330311">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330311/#Comment_330311" name="Item_102" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-16T17:29:34+00:00" title="June 16, 2011  5:29PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 16, 2011 5:43PM by C_Edwards.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the process of considering a response to Daniel's post I realized that something in the text isn't quite clear to me...\n<blockquote>3. ROLL THE DICE<br/>\u25b6\u25b6 She rolls her Action, Push, and Hurt dice all together.<br/><br/>\u25b6\u25b6 <b>For each result on individual result on a Hurt die, she eliminates any<br/>and all matching Action or Push dice, removing the Hurt dice as well.</b><br/>Eliminated Push dice are now discharged.</blockquote>\nDo I only remove Hurt dice that match the result on another die or do I remove all Hurt dice regardless? We've been leaving non-matching Hurt dice in the roll results. With the consequence that sometimes the Hurt dice actually help you out. Rereading the passage above I'm now thinking we've been doing it incorrectly. So, remove all Hurt dice before determining the roll result or just the ones that match another die?<br/><br/><br/>*edited to add: I think I've answered my own question by rereading the Dice section on page 9. Looks like we have indeed been doing it wrong.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_330324">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeremy%20Keller" title="Jeremy Keller"><img alt="Jeremy Keller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://jeremykeller.com/images/me_icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeremy%20Keller">Jeremy Keller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330324/#Comment_330324" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-16T18:01:17+00:00" title="June 16, 2011  6:01PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, Hurt dice only eliminate your positive dice, they're not counted towards your final result (unless you're using drugs).

Fleeting adjectives go away quickly and hacked SMGs can be dealt with by ditching (even if you're just leaving it in your car while you go into the hospital). <br/><br/>Plus Hurt dice do not always eliminate your highest result.

But indirectly its going to smooth over most disagreements without being needed.  In Dirty Secrets, frex its pretty easy to see when at least one other person at the table is really grooving on what's going on, so I can tell my veto would get overruled so I know I just have to suck it up and deal.  Other times it looks like pretty much everybody is giving it the hairy eyeball so I know it just needs someone to step up and say "hold on, no" and the veto will probably stick.  Similarly, the person saying the thing can see the looks they're getting and adjust what they're saying accordingly to avoid anyone having to veto.  <br/><br/>Games without such rules, IMO are like bicycles whose wheels are out of round.

Also, there is already a great deal of fiction evaluation happening during a contention and some of that tends to be a group process, such as the group brainstorming of adjectives you mentioned, Jeremy. I think the relatively narrow path that has to be walked in Technoir to align fiction and mechanics during a contention will lend itself to creating obvious vectors of use or denial for individual adjectives. That should help keep disconnects and disagreements to a minimum.<br/><br/>That said, I'm mostly fine with the way adjectives currently function. The Push dice are a big throttle on using positive adjectives so not having the potential to use any adjective positively doesn't strike me as being a big deal. Negative adjectives effecting every roll regardless does bother me some. The difference is that a negative adjective demands addition to the fiction where a positive adjective is used voluntarily. Which means that the demands of a negative adjective that don't make much sense under the circumstances in the fiction may break the flow of play. It could break the flow because suspension of disbelief has been broken and/or because nobody can imagine a satisfying way to blend the adjective into the fiction.<br/><br/>In play, if this happens, I'll just make an exception and we'll leave that negative adjective out of the equation. I think that making exceptions in this manner, for both using a negative adjective as a temporary positive and not applying a negative adjective when it doesn't make sense , is likely to be a popular hack anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_330488">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/amnesiack" title="amnesiack"><img alt="amnesiack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1012/830711303_f5d26761f6_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/amnesiack">amnesiack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330488/#Comment_330488" name="Item_109" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-17T14:42:34+00:00" title="June 17, 2011  2:42PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 17, 2011 2:54PM by amnesiack.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jeremy Keller</cite>The point is that the players are aware of the negative adjectives on their character sheets and tend to deal with them before they turn into issues with the fiction.<br/><br/>But I'll chew on this.

Once she's in, will she need Videoshop2020 to blur faces?<br/><br/>Unfortunately it's all just "magic" at the moment, and I'm not sure how to deal with that in a system that relys so heavily upon the fiction (and has an entire attribute just for hacking).<br/><br/>And I still think that connections are like the last place my players will think to go to get information.

So if I say, "I swing at the guy and hit him across his jaw. I want to make him<i>bruised</i>," and then I fail the roll, that means that I still swung and hit him, it just wasn't hard enough to bruise him.<br/></blockquote>\nI'm also finding it hard to maintain this sort of definitive narration approach among the players. It's very easy to lapse back into narrating your attempt to do something as opposed to the fact of you doing something. Part of that may be because it hasn't necessarily worked well to do it this way in some cases. There have been a few instances where it made more sense not to narrate that way and let success or failure plus Push dice spent determine the actual follow through of the action. Like just declaring that you're shooting at a guy then after you roll you say "I'm spending a Push die to make him <i>gut-shot</i>". Then narrate the opponents defense and getting shot in the gut.<br/><br/>So I have a PC who declares that he shoots an opponent in the guts. That's a pretty serious thing. You can't shake that off like you can someone punching you in the face. He rolls, and maybe he can't beat his opponents defense or his Push dice get taken out by Hurt dice. So I have a guy shot in the guts but with, at best, a fleeting adjective. Maybe no adjective at all. Action movie logic can make this work. Guy gets shot in the gut? Now he's just <i>pissed</i>. What if he gets shot in the eye? What if he gets both arms chopped off? At some point narrating actions as facts is going to get severely stretched I think.<br/><br/>Jeremy, I'm curious how you have handled similar situations in play and how you went about that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_330781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeremy%20Keller" title="Jeremy Keller"><img alt="Jeremy Keller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://jeremykeller.com/images/me_icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeremy%20Keller">Jeremy Keller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330781/#Comment_330781" name="Item_125" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-19T22:16:26+00:00" title="June 19, 2011 10:16PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ludanto</cite>Here's a problem I'm having with the "Hack" verb:  Players want to do stuff, and I'm not in a position to say that they can't.</blockquote>\nIf I'm not in a position to tell a player she can't do something, then I just let her do it. You'll notice there are no dice rolling rules for fighting with technology. There are only dice rolling rules for fighting with other people. When there's information that I think they should fight for, I make sure that information is in someone's pocket. Otherwise, just give it to them.<br/><br/>Like with your security camera footage. I might say "okay, you scrubbed the footage clean. Only problem is: when you where in there, you see that someone's already accessed the files. Seems like you can trace him to his physical location."<br/><br/>The Hack verb is there for hacking other people's stuff: mess with someone's linked gun or take over their car or cyberarm. That kinda thing. Figure any software or expertise you would need for that is rolled into the character's Hack rating. I probably need to go back and describe that verb better in the Generation chapter, don't I?\n<blockquote>And I still think that connections are like the last place my players will think to go to get information.  To them, that's what interrogating Threats and hacking Locations is about.  Connections are a hard sell in this regard.</blockquote>\nMake sure you're playing connections like they are close to the protagonists. Have them just start showing up in their lives like what happens in the examples. Show them how they can provide information, give missions, provide favors, and get involved in the plot. Use those relationship adjectives to your advantage. The connections are usually the whole reason the protagonists have anything to do with the plot map in the first place.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: C.

I will fix that. Yeah, sorry that the player's guide is horribly out of date. It hasn't been updated to match any of the beta versions.\n<blockquote>I'm also finding it hard to maintain this sort of definitive narration approach among the players.</blockquote>\nYeah, I really tried to make that a soft sell. You can handle this however you usually do in your group\u2014say it's a miss or whatever\u2014it won't break anything. In my group, I guess we don't quite take it to the Wushu level. We describe what the character does and not necessarily what effect it has. Lots of "I open fire with my jaguar" or maybe "I shoot him in the face." But we rarely go so far as to describe something we couldn't back up with the results of the roll. "I shoot him in the face" could result in him being grazed past his cheek. "I shoot him in the eye" is maybe going too far.<br/><br/>Keep in mind, in the process breakdown, describing the outcome of the attack doesn't happen until step 5 after you roll: "She describes the outcome of the attack only so far as to warrant that adjective, nothing more."<br/><br/>The main purpose of saying "the attack happened as described but was not effective enough to inflict a new adjective" is just to discourage people from saying "no, you missed," stomping on a player's narration, and making the character look incompetent. It's an opportunity to say, "the bullet flattened on his kevlar. It knocked him back a step, but he's still standing." Or "your sword cuts his arm, but you're not able to hack through it with this swing."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330833">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330833/#Comment_330833" name="Item_126" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-20T11:53:27+00:00" title="June 20, 2011 11:53AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jeremy Keller</cite>The main purpose of saying "the attack happened as described but was not effective enough to inflict a new adjective" is just to discourage people from saying "no, you missed," stomping on a player's narration, and making the character look incompetent.</blockquote>\nI'm starting to think that the Contention chapter could use, along with the existing stuff about what you do, a small section on how you do it. Just to cover the fine points of the techniques (particularly narration and how it relates to mechanical factors) that seem to work best during play. That might go a long way towards avoiding some of the disconnects that have come up in the discussion so far. It's easy to follow the rules and procedures of a game, but grasping and employing the techniques to use those rules and procedures to their full potential is most of the challenge to be overcome between you and the fun. Examples of play are great and helpful but they're not enough.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ludanto</cite>Here's a problem I'm having with the "Hack" verb:  Players want to do stuff, and I'm not in a position to say that they can't.</blockquote>\nI think what Jason is saying is that he doesn't have any idea, and the text doesn't provide him with sufficient knowledge to know, how hacking is supposed to function in the game. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ludanto</cite>I can't tell if they have a vector for whatever they want to do, because I don't know how it works in real life, much less the future.</blockquote>\nWhether they're dealing with a person or a camera doesn't seem to be the issue. The procedure and steps for hacking and how tags interrelate aren't clear to him I'd say. I'm still not really clear on some of it myself. Particularly if there needs to be a chain of matching -linked tags for objects in your personal network to be connected. For example, would a glove with only <i>gesture input</i> and <i>derma-linked</i> be connected to a set of cybereyes with <i>linked</i> and <i>nerve-linked</i>? I know it's all in there but it's not spelled out clearly enough for me to be sure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_330837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330837/#Comment_330837" name="Item_127" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-20T12:10:54+00:00" title="June 20, 2011 12:10PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Plot Map has turned out to be a really useful and fun thing for me as a GM. I've currently got three different sets of PCs plugged into the same plot map through different Connections. So they're all enmeshed in and moving through the same web of intrigue but they're engaging with different facets of it. The plot node structure along with how connections are attached to it has turned out to be a pretty robust and flexible system.<br/><br/>It also makes it easy to get up and running a session very quickly. This is turning out to be a great no-prep pickup game. In relation to that I think, Technoir also strikes me as a game where just getting the PCs into play quickly is much more important than the GM having any unique or especially creative method for doing so. It works perfectly well to just get a job from some guy in a bar (hopefully a Connection) because once play starts the plot map is going to pull the PCs in and things will get interesting fast.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeremy%20Keller" title="Jeremy Keller"><img alt="Jeremy Keller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://jeremykeller.com/images/me_icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeremy%20Keller">Jeremy Keller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330839/#Comment_330839" name="Item_128" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-20T12:33:00+00:00" title="June 20, 2011 12:33PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: C. Edwards</cite>I'm starting to think that the Contention chapter could use, along with the existing stuff about what you do, a small section on how you do it. Just to cover the fine points of the techniques (particularly narration and how it relates to mechanical factors) that seem to work best during play. That might go a long way towards avoiding some of the disconnects that have come up in the discussion so far. It's easy to follow the rules and procedures of a game, but grasping and employing the techniques to use those rules and procedures to their full potential is most of the challenge to be overcome between you and the fun. Examples of play are great and helpful but they're not enough.</blockquote>\nThe Contention chapter is being nearly completely rewritten. But I'm not sure I want to sell this any harder than I have. I'm not really trying to convince a group to do this any different than they already do. <br/>\n<blockquote>Whether they're dealing with a person or a camera doesn't seem to be the issue. The procedure and steps for hacking and how tags interrelate aren't clear to him I'd say. I'm still not really clear on some of it myself. Particularly if there needs to be a chain of matching -linked tags for objects in your personal network to be connected. For example, would a glove with only<i>gesture input</i>and<i>derma-linked</i>be connected to a set of cybereyes with<i>linked</i>and<i>nerve-linked</i>? I know it's all in there but it's not spelled out clearly enough for me to be sure.</blockquote>\nLike I said, I'll try to close up those gaps in the text.<br/><br/>In my vision of the tech, nerve-linked stuff only talks to other nerve-linked stuff. Once you have an object that has both nerve-linked and derma-linked, it can act as a hub between those two networks. Check out the Router Patch object for an item that connects your derma-linked network with your linked network.<br/><br/>But if that sounds like too much bookkeeping, ignore it. Just apply whatever methods you come up with consistently and you'll be fine. I want tags to inspire your vision of the future, not constrain you to mine. <br/><br/>I'm sorry I don't have the new version of the beta document yet. Like I said, I've been completely overhauling the Contention chapter. I need to rewrite the examples for it. I'm incorporating Will's edits for the other chapters. And I'll need to go through these threads again to make sure everything that's been brought up has been addressed. I'm hoping to have it ready for folks to look over soon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_330849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330849/#Comment_330849" name="Item_129" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-20T13:26:53+00:00" title="June 20, 2011  1:26PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jeremy Keller</cite>I'm not really trying to convince a group to do this any different than they already do.</blockquote>\nCue Spock eyebrow raise. Just make sure you tell us how to play THIS game. Doing that may require techniques and practices from your own play. Leaving too much dependent on the wide range of previous rpg experiences and practices can be dangerous.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jeremy Keller</cite>In my vision of the tech, nerve-linked stuff only talks to other nerve-linked stuff.

That's the sort of clear explanation and decisiveness I need from a game text. Then if I want to do it differently for some reason I will. Don't straddle fences in an attempt to keep people from thinking you're telling them how to play. When you design a game that is exactly what you should be doing.<br/><br/>Okay, I'll stop beating this drum now. Overall I'm very pleased with the experience I've had with Technoir so far and I'm really excited to get the finished version in my hands.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330883">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeremy%20Keller" title="Jeremy Keller"><img alt="Jeremy Keller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://jeremykeller.com/images/me_icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeremy%20Keller">Jeremy Keller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330883/#Comment_330883" name="Item_130" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-20T16:30:55+00:00" title="June 20, 2011  4:30PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, sorry if I sound overly defensive or anything.

What we were doing previously was making it more in line with modern real world hacking. A very hand-wavy layman's version of hacking anyway, with a dash of THE FUTURE. It worked well enough but felt like we weren't taking advantage of one of Technoir's strong points. Which is doing cool action-y conflicts between people. So in the interest of trying to capture the cool action-y-ness, the fiction of hacking became more virtual reality. Sort of Otherland meets Shadowrun.<br/><br/>Jack "One-Eye" Denton is sitting in a diner while trying to hack into the system for the dive motel, Electric Palms, next door. He locates the node address and enters, finding himself in a tropical forest of luminescent trees. Through gaps in the tree cover he can see a golden ziggurat. Searching around for any security measures, he spies a white tiger with flaming green eyes stalking him. He runs through the forest, toward the ziggurat, while keeping an eye on the tiger. The entrance to the ziggurat is blocked by a golden door and there is an interface panel on the wall next to it. The tiger lunges at Jack from behind. As tiger claws swipe at Jack's head he spins around to defend himself. Claws rake across the encryption of his Specks, sending sparks flying. While the tiger paces back and forth looking for an opening, Jack moves in a blur of speed, busting the golden door into pixelated oblivion. He enters the ziggurat and finds himself in a darkened room, standing at a control terminal that gives him system-wide access. After finding the surveillance footage he needs Jack disconnects, pays for his coffee, and moves to the next stage of his plan.<br/><br/>Of course there were rolls and adjectives and all that good stuff in there. This worked a lot better for us and was certainly more engaging than how we were handling it. I'm sure other people have been handling it this way all along, and I'm not sure why I didn't think to do it sooner. So for anybody that hasn't gone a more virtual reality route with hacking, and isn't satisfied with how you're doing it now, you might want to give it a try.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_331839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331839/#Comment_331839" name="Item_132" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-27T07:23:16+00:00" title="June 27, 2011  7:23AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Chris!<br/>There's something to that.

He scores 1, 3, 5, 5 and 6. Bahzo's maximum reaction is 4. According to the rules on pg 107, a protagonist must spend a Push die to move a wound from fleeting to sticky. It also shows the character spending one of two "5"s that were rolled to make it so. So, a couple of questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Does Heywood need a push die to be the highest die (or the result die) in order to spend it and create a sticky adjective. (So in the in above case, would the six need to have been a Push die to use it to create a sticky adjective?<br/>\n2. If so, does the can you only spend the die (or dice) equal to the result? For example, Heywood gets the 6 result and applies the adjective "grazed". He upgrades "grazed" to "shot" by spending the push die result of 6. Could he spend another push die (for example the push die that came up as 1) to increase the "shot" adjective to "shattered"?<br/>\n3. If not, could the protagonist voluntarily choose a lower result (the 5.1) for example, to be able to spend 2 dice?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe entire thing is a little confusing because the push dice spent are the actual results; just wonder if that is required.<br/>\n<br/>\nCraig                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_341816">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeremy%20Keller" title="Jeremy Keller"><img alt="Jeremy Keller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://jeremykeller.com/images/me_icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeremy%20Keller">Jeremy Keller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341816/#Comment_341816" name="Item_134" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-07T05:07:03+00:00" title="September  7, 2011  5:07AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Craig,<br/><br/>The result of the Push dice you spend doesn't matter.
