I'm a gamer. I go to filking conventions, larping conventions, gaming conventions, and general sf conventions.<br/>At general sf conventions, I do filking at night. I may go to a dance -- a Regency or Victorian or Swing or Steampunk dance. I'm not likely to do anything more modern than that. I may do a concert during the day, but I really would rather do panels. But, you know, if Tricky Pixie's the musical guest, as in Reno, I'm there.<br/><br/>At filking conventions, I go to concerts and filking. It's music and more music, and the occasional seminar I generally don't get around to making (though I did make one of Barry Childs-Helton's jamming workshops at the Ohio Valley Filk Festival.<br/>At gaming conventions, music is not what I'm there for.<br/><br/>At GenCon, I may stop and dance when a small band is playing in an ample enough space, especially if I'm with Josh and the music's folk / folk-rock. I'll say hello to the musicians selling their CDs, and if we somehow don't have all the ones we want from the musicians we know, we may well pick up what we're lacking. But, I'm there for the gaming. I want the music to be somewhere the people who want it can find it, and where it won't be obtrusive to me.<br/><br/>Except...<br/>Double Exposure asked Josh and me to run filking at Dreamation, and naturally enough, we said yes.<br/>This was a success, if you define success as "We never had to sing just to each other". There were 3-5 people there (counting us) for the entire two hours scheduled for the filk. Vinnie wants to try this again, and Josh has been contacting filkers who game (rather a lot of us), and some folks think going to a gaming convention where filking might happen one night is delightful.<br/><br/>But I'm still primarily there for the gaming.<br/>I got to play in two of Bill White's wonderfully researched Cthulhu games. I think I understand Cthulhu Dark pacing a lot better now.<br/>I got to play in Night's Black Agents. I still don't get the General system of Gumshoe, but the game felt like one of those movies with explosions every other scene -- ones our heroes can outrun -- and it was awesome.<br/>I got to play in Hocus Focus Fiasco with Kat Miller and three other gamers who were totally _on_.<br/>I got to playtest The Tavern and I'm still thinking about how that game worked and about all the food stories.<br/>I got to play Monster of the Week, with bits of Monsterhearts' mindset creeping in, and I got to play Monsterwarts!<br/><br/>And, during all of those games, none of which I would have wanted to miss, I was not wanting music.<br/><br/>So, for a gaming convention, I want the music other folks want to listen to, and I want it where they can find it and it won't get in the way of the games I'm playing. If I am the music, I want it where folks who want to listen to it can find it, and where it won't bother anyone else.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_407458">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/silby" title="silby"><img alt="silby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/silby">silby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407458/#Comment_407458" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-26T23:22:42+00:00" title="February 26, 2013 11:22PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I saw the pillows at Anime Boston 2008, which was a peak experience.

And clearly they'd be invited and were on a schedule of performers, but it was also just right in the hallway. There wasn't really any way to engage, other than to just stand there in the busy hallway and stare at them.<br/><br/>Are you wanting to create a space for dancing? Are you wanting to create some nice geeky backdrop music in the cafe at lunchtime? Are you wanting people to go to a music show at a convention? Are you wanting to add some soundtrack music in the background, during gaming sessions?<br/><br/>Geeks like lots of different types of music, and the answers change depending on what you plan to *do* with that music.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_407474">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JLHBurnett" title="JLHBurnett"><img alt="JLHBurnett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/722/nB1X4KGH4YFEW.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JLHBurnett">JLHBurnett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407474/#Comment_407474" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-27T04:53:49+00:00" title="February 27, 2013  4:53AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 27, 2013 4:54AM by JLHBurnett.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>I will have to investigate this supposed "Ghoultown".<br/></blockquote>\n<a href="http://www.ghoultown.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.ghoultown.com/</a><br/><br/>They're a "gothabilly" band that plays heavy country/cowboy songs about zombies, murder and Jonah Hex.

So if that's what we're talking about, I feel like I don't have a foundational context for this conversation.  If there was a panel about music appropriate for certain games or whatever, then that might make sense to me, except live music is sort of a weird combination...how would that work?  Mostly, I think I'd vastly prefer not to have music while I'm trying to play games.  It's bad enough shouting over the other fifty tables of gamers.<br/><br/>If we're talking about more general SF cons, I guess I can see a place for that.
