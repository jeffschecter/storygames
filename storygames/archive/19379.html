Thanks to the kind permission of Pelgrane Press, it's available for free (it's an add-on for FG), at fantasygrounds.com in the Armory forum. Here's a short video overview that shows what it looks like and how it works:<br/><span class="VideoWrap"><span class="Video YouTube" data-youtube="youtube-EYD0RxtlNGs?autoplay=1"><span class="VideoPreview"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYD0RxtlNGs"><img border="0" height="385" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/EYD0RxtlNGs/0.jpg" width="640"/></a></span><span class="VideoPlayer"></span></span></span><br/><br/>Disclaimer: This is not a commercial endeavor. I just made this for my own use and thought some of you might get some use out of it as well. I'm not selling anything or getting paid by anyone. However, while the ruleset is a free download, you would need to have bought the Trail of Cthulhu rulebook and FG software in order to make use of it, just to be clear.<br/><br/>Thanks and enjoy!<br/>Scott                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
