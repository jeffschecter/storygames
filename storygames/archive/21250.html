It's played by two people who share the narration and build a story together. I've used a lot of forum help designing the game although not much of SG as I am pretty new here. I think I have something that's works good and is fun. I would appreciate any help with play testing. I'm looking for people who might take the time to play it (about an hour of play time after reading) and even people who only have time to read it(about 2000 words long). Here is the intro/summary from the game:<br/><br/>ESCAPE miniRPG<br/><br/>Escape is a game of fanciful chases. There is the hunter who is more<br/>knowledgeable of the landscape and much faster than the prey. Then there is the<br/>prey who has a head start and uses their wits to complete the escape before they are<br/>captured. The setting and genre are almost infinite and determined by the players,<br/>you need only answer a few questions before starting the game.<br/><br/>The Gist<br/>\xad-This is an RPG for two people who share the narration while playing a chase<br/>scene.<br/>\xad-There is the prey who has escaped and has a head start.<br/>\xad-There is the hunter who knows the landscape and is faster than the prey.<br/>\xad-6 sided dice are used to play. You will need a minimum of 2 but 4 is preferable.<br/>\xad-You can use the play sheets provided or just use a pencil and paper to keep track<br/>of play.<br/>\xad-You must roll 2D6(keep the highest) for every action you take.<br/><br/>The play test documents are here:<br/><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8U1saX6-rhIWHRVNDhPRVVGOWc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8U1saX6-rhIWHRVNDhPRVVGOWc</a><br/><br/><br/>There is a questionnaire for readers and players.

Not just as a mini-game, but larger story can certainly be a "chase" in the background even if smaller things happen there in between.<br/><br/>In addition to this, you can define "chase" in fiction in myriad of ways. Romantic chase for example, or subset of crime thrillers where the cop chases after the serial killer and so forth. I really like when a game doesn't fix the fictional content, but rather has some underlying principle or "simulation" (or many of them) that is employed.<br/><br/>I did a quick read and it seemed quite clear. I'll read it again soonish and answer to your questionnaire.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465589">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/killertick" title="killertick"><img alt="killertick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/killertick">killertick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465589/#Comment_465589" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-14T01:12:25+00:00" title="August 14, 2017  1:12AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you. The more I play it and see it played I think I have it named poorly in the sense that "Escape" may be too limiting/narrow to the scope of play. I have played where there is literally a wolf hunting an Elk and have heard of some people playing a girl pursuing her high school crush. I am thinking on the title, maybe I can come up with something more fitting but not so basic as "The Chase" <br/><br/>Your input, even just in the comments here is appreciated. Thanks for taking the time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
