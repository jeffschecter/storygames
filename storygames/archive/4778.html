This is mostly a blow-by-blow of our game - fair warning.<br/><br/>I'd played with Clint, in a game run by Kevin Allen Jr, at Gen Con, so I knew I had a handle on the games simple mechanics and general flow.  Being a history buff I rooted around and got a better feel for the time and place, and made up a list of the actual colonists for the players to draw from, along with some information on the surrounding groups of native Americans (<a href="http://www.meekmok.com/sassy/games/roanoke/roanoke_notes.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a>, if you are interested).  I decided Drake's lost garrison from 1585 had gone native, taking over the Sucotan tribe in a "Man who would be king" scenario with a liberal dash of cannibalistic atavism to spice things up.  Beyond that I had no idea what would happen.<br/><br/>The player characters were Cutbert White, a sneak-thief and ne'er-do-well afraid of his past, Henry Payne, a woodsman who had the trait "survivor" and an ironic fear of the natives, Master Howe, one of the leaders of the colony burdened with guilt over his failure and terrified of going hungry, and Elanor Dare, with her newborn, Virginia, in her arms.  She was afraid of wild beasts.  I really licked my chops at that one.<br/><br/>Fears made initial scene framing pretty easy.  Elanor was the hardest, because she wasn't apt to trapise off into bear country.  I made her husband, Anainas, go weird and start keeping violent, half-wolf dogs he traded from the Croatoan.  The leader of the Succotan was an old criminal friend of Curtbert White's.  I kept Payne jumping with flesh-eating Sucotan war parties, and Howe just fell apart along with the colony.  "Starvation" as a fear was the weakest of the lot and hardest to implement for me.<br/><br/>I started the session with a bang - mysterious "monsters" killed and partially ate a colonist and kidnapped a women, all witnessed by George Howe's young son.  They set out in pursuit and we had a nice extended conflict for the chase, where we alternately pushed forward dice - them finding the war party, me describing the Sucotan setting up an ambush and waiting for them.  There was a huge fight that really highlighted what's good about the Wushu-adpated system, which is geared toward dramatic ass-kicking.  Outside of direct combat, we found the Wushu-based system a little clumsy in our hands, but that was as much our problem as the system's.  Anyway, I got to bring in Payne's fear ("Indians!  Zillions of 'em!") and White's fear ("That's no savage - it's old William Swabber from your canting crew!"), so they sucked and had to add a lot of Doom just to scrape by.  White got separated and ended up being hunted down in a second conflict.  He escaped, but Mike, playing White, narrated ending up on a beach where former Governor White (no relation, missing for years, having abandoned the colony, more or less) was chatting amicably with Sucotan chief Pemipasan and Drake's former soldiers, his ship anchored nearby.  This was a cool move and changed the game a bit.<br/><br/>While all this nonsense was going down, we had a bone-chilling scene where the Sucotan raided the actual colony, and Elanor Dare huddled in her miserable hut, holding her baby, listening to the Indians break through the palisade with the help of English guns.  Had I won, it would have been a murderous defeat, but Ian fed the Doom pot and saved the colony.  <br/><br/>(Continued...)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_107486">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107486/#Comment_107486" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-09T05:26:35+00:00" title="November  9, 2007  5:26AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            They regrouped and decided that the entire colony needed to head south, to their Croatoan "friends", and beg for shelter and defense.  It was a risky and awesome move.  The Sucotan were hunting them, Governor White's men were hunting them, they were in bad trouble.  Half-way to hatteras and the Croatoans, they had to stop among the Weapemac (who I relocated to put in their way).  My brother, who happened to be wandering by, got roped into playing King Chawanook, and they had a nice conflict over whether the Weapemac would take the fugitives in.  They did, but just barely, and again the Doom got increased.  <br/><br/>I had Chawanook's daughter, Weopim, try to steal beautiful baby Virginia Dare in the night.  Conflict, Ian, as Elanor, won, but he narrated freaking out and killing the girl - a great move.  The colonists, already very weird and desperate and starving, decided that the only reasonable solution was to prevent King Chawanook from finding out.  They butchered the corpse and took it with them.  By the time Chawanook figured out what had happened, they were near the Croatoan and (they thought) safety.<br/><br/>So we approached an obvious endgame.  I emptied the Doom and we had eight - twice the number of players, and a signal for "Terrible Death".  Everyone was very excited to narrate their doom.<br/><br/>Elanor Dare and her husband ran off, heading south along the barrier island, where she and her baby were mauled to death by Anainas' dogs.  Not one to waste good meat, they were then eaten by Anainas.<br/><br/>George Howe was captured by the combined Sucotan/Weapemac forces while fighting a delaying action to give the women and children time to get across the water to Hatteras and safety.  He was taken to Chepanoc, tied to a post, and fed the flesh of fellow colonists until it ran out.  Then he starved to death in public.<br/><br/>Cutbert White, a true rascal, snuck onto the first boat across the sound with the women and children.  Upon reaching the Croatoan, they exchanged gifts, and when one bag was opened, Weopim's severed head fell out.  They were all beaten to death on the beach, as their husbands and fathers watched from across the water.<br/><br/>Henry Payne "survived" - he went completely native in the marshes.  In 1590, when the true relief expedition arrived, he rushed out of the woods in joy but, mistaken for a crazed Sucotan, was shot in the face.  <br/><br/>So it was a cheerful evening of sun-dappled frolicking in the New World.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_107524">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anemone" title="Anemone"><img alt="Anemone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.tlucretius.net/temp/anemone_icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anemone">Anemone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107524/#Comment_107524" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-09T09:41:40+00:00" title="November  9, 2007  9:41AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            w00t!

They've occasionally needed Doom.  <br/><br/>We also have a new house rule this season, the "Scarce Food" rule. The GM puts five "Food tickets" for the six colonists who were present (and a ghost, who doesn't need to eat).  Players get a food ticket for creating a complication in someone's life or for getting them in trouble.  Extra food tickets can be bartered, etc.  If you don't have enough food, you start taking penalties.  This has in some ways distracted us from the pursuit of Doom as we scramble to make each other's lives miser... I mean, to get involved with each other's plot lines.  :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_107544">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107544/#Comment_107544" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-09T12:03:17+00:00" title="November  9, 2007 12:03PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How many sessions will your game end up being?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_107991">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anemone" title="Anemone"><img alt="Anemone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.tlucretius.net/temp/anemone_icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anemone">Anemone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107991/#Comment_107991" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-12T15:20:33+00:00" title="November 12, 2007  3:20PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let's see...
