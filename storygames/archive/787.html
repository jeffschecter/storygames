                    Just a random question here -<br/>
What games do you know that use props in actually determining mechanical success?<br/>
<br/>
Like, physical objects aside from dice, dreidels, etc...<br/>
<br/>
EXAMPLE OF WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT: (example involves gun violence, to be warned)<br/>
Random game idea me and a friend came up with, called Desperation:<br/>
Each player has a capgun... before play, fire the gun 7 times... so that only one "cap" remains.<br/>
Spin the cap gun barrel, so you aren't sure how many times you will have to pull the trigger before hitting the cap. The cap gun is now set up for "Russian Roulette".<br/>
<br/>
Gameplay works as such:<br/>
Narration goes around in turns.<br/>
A player can say, "I don't like that narration. I want to block it."<br/>
That player then points the cap gun at the narrator, and pulls the trigger.<br/>
If the cap goes off, then the narration is blocked, the scene considered void...<br/>
And that player's character will die, as narrated by the shooter.<br/>
<br/>
For each time you point the gun at another player, you will then have to point the gun at your own narration. This means it will be shoot other, shoot self, shoot other...<br/>
If the cap goes off, then the narration is changed... into a scene where  the narrator/shooter must narrate their character's own self-destruction.<br/>
<br/>
[/END EXAMPLE]<br/>
<br/>
So... in that, the props (fake guns) were being used to add to the tension and tone of the game.<br/>
The mechanic could have worked with pulling slips of paper out of a hat...<br/>
It could have been altered to work with dice...<br/>
<br/>
But in the end the idea of shooting each other, and adding in elements of Russian Roulette... captured the exact mood we wanted:<br/>
-gritty, tense, violent, desperate, horrifying.<br/>
<br/>
Any other games use props as a way to directly determine success?                </div>

                            Honestly, coming up with something where the props are _essential_ is much harder.  Even the cap gun example could be handled with a stack of dice, coins, or other randomizer.  But the prop (in this case, the cap gun) definately adds a lot of _zing_ to the idea.<br/>
<br/>
The use of cigarettes in Crispin Glover is Going to Kill me was similarly awesome.<br/>
<br/>
Closest thign to essential that springs to mind is a  fantastic larp idea Adam Dray had, where character elements were physically written on cards, handed over and ripped in half as conflict resolution.  Simple, yet very tactile.<br/>

                            The game was, in fact, <em>Asylym</em>, and resolution was pulling different-colored marbles out of a bag, and you'd lose what you pulled as you went, so you were very literally losing your marbles.                        </div>

<br/>
Oh, isn't that clevah.<br/>
The more I think about htat... the more I think: wow, that's really cool.<br/>
Because it uses player skill (at marbles) to determine character success...<br/>
Something that most RPGs dont do in their testing mechanics.<br/>
Cool!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"But the prop (in this case, the cap gun) definately adds a lot of _zing_ to the idea."<br/>
<br/>
The act of physically pointing a gun at someone and pulling the trigger carried the tone, "I am shooting you in the face, because I don't like what you said."<br/>
<br/>
Contract that with the act of physically rolling 2d6 and comparing resulsts, which carries the tone, "Let's test to see whether this narration goes through or your character dies."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"The use of cigarettes in Crispin Glover is Going to Kill me was similarly awesome"<br/>
<br/>
I have never heard of this game... but am intrigued! Tell me more!                        </div>

<i>Dread</i> uses Jenga as its resolution mechanic (see <a href="http://www.tiltingatwindmills.net" rel="nofollow">Tilting at Windmills</a>).  You really feel the fear as you make pull after pull, trying not to tip the tower and get your character killed!

                            There's not a lot of games that require physical props, truthfully.<br/><br/>But that doesn't stop us from thinking of some cool ways props could be used.<br/><br/>I was thinking of a mod to the old d6  (Star Wars) game that could be tooled to any system, but it was specifically for roleplaying in MACROSS/Robotech. Basically all the players had to go out and buy:<br/><br/>A toy airplane.  Try to keep them all within the same general size.<br/><br/>A toy robot. The robot needed a gun/rifle, and posable arms/legs.<br/><br/>Basically, in dogfight scenes you wouldn't use tactics, you would pick up two planes and demonstrate how you're closing in, banking, barreling, etc, for a high bonus (like 2d, or in Fudge FATE a +1), with an option of getting double that if other agreed it was particularly cool.<br/><br/>The robot was for the scenes ala Macross Plus, so you can demonstrate flying, "transforming" into robot mode to shoot, then transform into a plane again to continue flying (just swap the robot in for the plane).<br/><br/>When I thought about the awesome action scenes of the anime, and then think about running it normal RPG style (on a 2D plane with little minis and rounds and stuff), it just totally didin't fit.<br/><br/>There are Macross toys that transform:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.blastotoys.com/images/products/macross-148hikaru.jpg"/><br/><br/>However, because I wanted it high action, the act of transforming it back and forth would be too long (in the anime they'll flip between modes within like 2 seconds, and it would take a minute or so to physically transform them back and forth. Plus, they're too expensive to buy two per person).<br/><br/>Basically it's a game of "Action Direction" (ala movies).<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

Too cool on the airplane thing.<br/>

And... Dread sounds cool.<br/>
As strange as this sounds...<br/>
I like the idea that player skill (in pulling jenga blocks) determines character success.<br/>
<br/>
I see props being used mechanically:<br/>
-as a way of demonstrating action (playing with toy airplanes)<br/>
-as a dice replacement mechanism that feels more "in genre" (cap gun roulette, poker playing, jenga)<br/>
-as a way of integrating tension at the table (jenga mostly)<br/>
<br/>
Are there any other significant ways they can be used?                        </div>

                            I've occasionally used props to simulate to the players what their characters are going through, like the time that a player wanted to spy on a meeting while doing something complex (I can't remember exactly what).  I let the player listen in on the meeting, but I made them juggle at the same time.  Whatever they could hear while trying to concentrate on juggling?  That's what they could remember in character.

                            I like the cigarettes and the cap gun. It's interesting that the two main ways of using props are as randomisers and as timers.<br/><br/>I'm working on a game called <i>Tentacly Oozes Battle At The Edge Of Time</i> which uses Plasticine. Each player has a Plasticine monster (a Tentacly Ooze). <br/><br/>To attack, you mould one of your arms outwards, without touching the floor, until it hits the other monster. For the attack to succeed, the moulded arm must stay in place for five seconds, without falling. So that's a sort of Plasticine-based resolution system.<br/><br/>The juggling is interesting too. I'm reminded of French LARPs where, to do something like pick a lock, you actually have to solve a puzzle (like one of those wire puzzles where you separate two twisted wires, or a sliding block puzzle or something).<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            "like the time that a player wanted to spy on a meeting while doing something complex (I can't remember exactly what). I let the player listen in on the meeting, but I made them juggle at the same time. Whatever they could hear while trying to concentrate on juggling? That's what they could remember in character. It was fun. "<br/>
<br/>
Very cool.<br/>
Did the player catch very much?                        </div>

                            I have a cute little superdeformed Ã£Æ’Å¾Ã£â€šÂ¯Ã£Æ’Â­Ã£â€šÂ¹ VF-1 Valkyrie (Andy's plane, above) that would probably be useable with 1.5" hex minis. Get a whole bunch of these, and battle.<br/>
<br/>
I think Andy's idea is much cooler, though.                        </div>

                            A while back I got a set of four very small Fullmetal Alchemist plushies (here's <a href="http://www.yesanimation.com/fualpldokeed.html" rel="nofollow">a pic of one of Edward</a>; there's also Alphonse, Roy, and Riza), and I was thinking of doing a con game/one shot where the players pick out which character they'll play by grabbing one of the plushies.<br/><br/>There's DeadLands of course, which involved dice of d4 through d20, and a deck of playing cards, <b>and</b> poker chips. It's atmospheric, but at times kind of annoying, and on occasion badly implemented ("You pulled a black Joker this time, so your Junker takes 2d20 damage directly to his head.... Which kills him.")<br/><br/>One of Guardians of Order's very earliest products was a wargame called "Toying With Destruction" where your minis were any and all toys you might have on hand.<br/><br/>I do like the idea of using Macross variable fighter toys tho. <img alt=":3" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/blush.png" title=":3"/> And a lot of anime series have little figures of about the right size for gaming among their merchandise. If I could afford to spend a few hundred dollars on it, there are some excellent Disgaea figures come to think of it... This is part of why I like the carstock minis my artist friend makes.                        </div>

<p>There's a few games (as far as I know, Jonathan's <em>Pale Continent</em> was the first) that simply co-opt a traditional board game's components to use as props. Chess pieces are pretty good for this because they come packaged with power relationships.</p>

                            I'm pretty sure that in Asylum, drawn marbles go back into the bag. I'll have to check my copy, but you've got five pairs of colored marbles, valued at 1-5. I believe the order is black, red, green, blue, white. You always draw two, so you get either a 2d5 distribution or a pair of colors (green, white).<br/><br/>I had a not-so-fun miniatures boardgame that included small periscopes to check line-of-sight. (<a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/image/36642" rel="nofollow">Image from BGG</a>).<br/><br/>What about Everway? I have it, but haven't read it in forever. I know there's a custom deck of cards.<br/><br/>What about Sketch? What you draw is what you can do.<br/><br/>What about Under the Bed? No deck, no play.<br/><br/>Obligatory Deadlands reference: You need at least two decks of cards, plus one per huckster, plus poker chips, plus a smegload of dice.<br/><br/>Hellfire, even LARPS: If you can bop the other person, you hit. (Incidentally, that's how I run Clay-O-Rama.) Fuzzy Heroes, which I've never played, also relies on this sort of physical representation.<br/><br/>I also suspect that some adventures/modules/boxed campaigns come with props that have clues, without which you can't play or win. Think about the "How to Host a Murder" games.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hm, a little all over the board here.<br/><br/>MDK                        </div>
