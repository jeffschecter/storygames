We had been playing D&amp;D once a week for four years and got a little burnt out. Now, we've returned with a renewed vigor and some different mindsets about what is fun.<br/><br/>(Somewhat) surprisingly to me, after spending about a half hour describing Fred's wonderful Spirit of the Century and its mechanics, the players were on board. We gave other systems a look over, but previous experience with FATE 2.0 (one session!) and the coolness of Aspects (especially tagging) and the inspired character creation method of Novels really won them over. I had a great experience with them and I'm going to use this thread to keep people appraised of my game.<br/><br/>I'm doing this for four reasons:<br/><br/>1) I really don't use my blog anymore. I get better visibility and responses on SG.<br/>2) I'm really stoked and I love to share my ideas and game experiences with this board.<br/>3) I'm basically converting traditional gamers with an Illusionist mindset to free thinking fun factories and I know that some people struggle with this every day.<br/>4) I'm sure some people have wondered about running SotC in a WWII setting or with more paranormal/supernatural elements. We'll see how it works out!<br/><br/>Comments are completely welcome.<br/><br/>Here is the email I just sent out recapping our last session:<br/><br/>Okay, so here's what I remember being discussed at the game the other<br/>night (and other thoughts that have occurred since then):<br/><br/>We went over what people wanted to play. After much discussion, we<br/>agreed to an on-the-cusp-WWII setting where the characters would be a<br/>cell of paranormal investigators organized by an unknown benefactor.<br/>(Dark*Matter X Spirit of the Century). FATE 3rd (embedded in Spirit of<br/>the Century) rules will be used. The game will be about discovering<br/>the Hidden History of the world while making choices that will Change<br/>it. Unlike the pulp genre, we won't have guaranteed character<br/>survival. The tone will be darker and less optimistic than pulp.<br/><br/>Please try to create at least two characters in your head before<br/>arriving. The idea is to run through story arcs (3-5 sessions long)<br/>that will allow you to bring in different characters for different<br/>missions. If this turns out to be suboptimal I will switch the story<br/>arcs to appeal to only the characters you currently have.<br/>[Editor's Note: Four years of character growth and continuity is a hell of a challenge to govern.]<br/><br/>Character creation will not be full length as it appears in SotC. We<br/>will do Childhood, WWI, and your first Mystery Novel - which will be<br/>your first encounter with the Paranormal. We will be doing character<br/>creation as a group at the next session, but try to think about the<br/>Mystery Novel. Specifically, you will need to have an Aspect that ties<br/>you to the world of the Paranormal Investigations, something that will<br/>keep you coming back through the meatgrinder again and again. For<br/>example, think of Fox Mulder and his sister. He keeps coming back to<br/>it all, hoping to discover what happened to her and where she is. If<br/>this Aspect ever gets resolved, be prepared for you character to leave<br/>the story and become an NPC (permanently, unless you can come up with<br/>another Aspect that ties the character deeper to the world of the<br/>paranormal). Feel free to name the Aspect something like "The Mystery<br/>of My Abducted Sister" or "What the hell happened at Dublin that<br/>night?"<br/>[Editor's Note: Two things here: One, the players expressed interest in character growth but not wimpy characters. Two, as they aren't going to exactly be Pulp Heroes, they aren't going to have 'already won and just need a reason to adventure'. I wanted a solid tether authored by them to keep them in the game.]<br/><br/>We will have a time limit set for any rules discussions that get out of hand.<br/>[Editor's Note: I don't expect this to be needed. It is a vestigal concern from our previous games.]<br/><br/>I am responsible for preparing the stories and being truly familiar<br/>with the rules. You all are responsible for bringing as much fun story<br/>to the table that you can. We are all responsible for bringing up any<br/>issues we have.<br/>[Editor's Note: I accept the Illusionism for what  it is. We'll see what our game evolves into.]                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Flynn" title="Flynn"><img alt="Flynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Flynn">Flynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59344/#Comment_59344" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-06T14:27:48+00:00" title="March  6, 2007  2:27PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just want to compliment you on so clearing setting out the player responsibilities at the end of your email.

It's funny how it developed, although I'm glad it happened. I brought my copy of the d20 Modern Dark*Matter book as a pretty book to have people flip through while we were discussing game ideas. I'm not sure what I plan on pulling out of the system but I pretty much have free reign. After all my hippy gaming experience recently, it'll be refreshing to have a story be coherent not from a (possibly complicated) set of rules but from a single 'author' of the background story.<br/><br/>Which, if there's anything my players tell me, it's that I'm good at delivering on back story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59564">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59564/#Comment_59564" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-07T08:23:16+00:00" title="March  7, 2007  8:23AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 7, 2007 8:23AM by iago.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark Causey</cite>High praise!

Don't neglect it! If you are going to do three phases, I suggest you allow them to build up to ten aspects over the course of the first few session. Basically, have them play out their next two novels and incorporate the resulting four aspects into their characters and carry them forward.<br/><br/>2) Have a mechanical way to tie the characters together. Sure, it's great that they have a reason to adventure, but if they don't have a strong reason to hang out together, you'll have a handful of separate investigations going on in no time. Lack of group cohesion is probably the single biggest reason long-term games fall apart. I don't mean "party play" - they can go off in separate directions - but if they don't have reasons to help each other, beyond their "jobs," that's trouble waiting to happen. You can do this in your first adventure, if you want to spend the time doing it and the players enjoy that. If you want to skip that step, make sure you mandate some connection amongst all of the characters - some of them went to school together, some served together, some are family, whatever.<br/><br/>3) "The Hidden History of the World" - reading this makes me think of World War II as more of a clash among conspiracies striving to dictate the destiny of the world than petty countries vying over land and rhetoric. There are so many wacky occult goings-on in that time period, as Hellboy often underlines, that I think it would be awesome to see the temporal powers (US, UK, France, USSR, Germany, and Japan, among others) as puppets for vast, slow-moving conspiracies suddenly hustled onto a fast-track for the domination of the future.<br/><br/>My two cents' worth,<br/>MDG                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_59621">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59621/#Comment_59621" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-07T10:43:30+00:00" title="March  7, 2007 10:43AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthew Gandy</cite>As an old FATE GM processing and internalizing all the new bits in SotC, I have a few comments:<br/><br/>1) Character creation is one of the hottest and most fun bits of SotC.
