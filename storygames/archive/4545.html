It's great!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe beautiful simplicity of the adventure creation chapter makes me want to run it immediately! And so many great details, like the way there are fewer spells, but they each *do* more than in later incarnations of the game, and how the six stats handle practically everything an adventurer is called upon to do. The advice for players is largely golden, too, with a real focus on at-the-table fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a couple of queries for Ben, or anyone else who's played this version recently:-<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Wizards get a tiny number of spells to cast. Won't they get bored before and after? Their options seem pretty limited.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Rules Cyclopedia has rules for skills: Good? Bad? Unnecessary? How about the weaponmastery rules in the Master's set?<br/>\n<br/>\n3) There's not a lot in the way of combat manouvres, rules for stunts/cunning actions, or other options to affect your basic values in combat. Is this at all frustrating in play for the fighters?<br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts on the above would be appreciated, along with any fuzzy warm feelings towards Tom Moldvay and basic D&amp;D.;                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102889">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102889/#Comment_102889" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-13T09:46:59+00:00" title="October 13, 2007  9:46AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've never played the Moldvay edition, although I really want to at least read through it.

Is it Erol Otus or Larry Elmore. Otus is the one), so concerns like skills systems and "the master set" don't figure into it at all. But let's answer your questions:<br><br>1) That's the wizard player's problem, not the GMs. I've found that there is generally plenty for wizards to do, particularly when you realize that they essentially start with more money than any other class. If the wizard is bored that's the fault of the player: I suggest they play a fighter or dwarf.<br><br>2) These are totally irrelevant, as mentioned above. I would urge people not to graft on additional rules for the first few times you play. I grafted on a skill rule early on and it was totally meaningless. Likewise, weapon specializations just prevent people from using the weapons that they find in the dungeon, which is no fun.<br><br>3) There are four combat maneuvers: Talk, Fight, Run and Wait. All else is details. As a GM, part of your job is handling said details, which means making decisions on the fly about what the players decide to do. So, like, if that guy wants to pour holy water over him as protection from the ghouls? That's up to you to decide how it works. Don't get attached to one particular decisions: if something works well, players will try it over and over, and you might need to nerf it or change how it works. That's okay, it's part of the game.<br><br>yrs--<br>--Ben                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102901">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ignotus" title="Ignotus"><img alt="Ignotus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ignotus">Ignotus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102901/#Comment_102901" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-13T12:52:22+00:00" title="October 13, 2007 12:52PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Does the moldvay edition have particular virtues as opposed to other editions of BD&amp;D (especially the one available on drivethrurpg)?

The goodness-per-page ratio is a little better. These aren't make-or-break virtues, IMO. So if you can't find Moldvay's without breaking the bank, you'll do fine with basic. <br/><br/>Mind you, basic Red has virtues too. That edition seems to come into its own with the box sets that follow. "Expert" (Blue) and "Companion" (Green), in particular, are really functional and evocative, if quirky. The very last box set, Immortal, was fairly bizarre for me at the time but I'm starting to dig the concept, if not the execution.<br/><br/>If you just want *one* box, go Moldvay, if possible. If you want a complete line, go for the five sets.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102926">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/peteramthor" title="peteramthor"><img alt="peteramthor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://trulyrural.com/cyberavatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/peteramthor">peteramthor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102926/#Comment_102926" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-13T15:38:27+00:00" title="October 13, 2007  3:38PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I never had the Moldvay edition of the game.

I'm afraid you can't get around writing up the spells.<br/><br/>As for xps; Actual defeat of the monster is not nearly as valuable in xps as grabbing their loot. There's a handy chart where all you really need to know is the HD of the critter + whether they have special abilities or not. IF you end up making houserules, XPs and advancement is probably the first place it should occur.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103042">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103042/#Comment_103042" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-14T18:51:15+00:00" title="October 14, 2007  6:51PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can someone who believes there's a significant difference between the 1981 Moldvay and the 1983 Mentzer version explain what the difference is?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/carjack" title="carjack"><img alt="carjack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/carjack">carjack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103046/#Comment_103046" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-14T19:11:28+00:00" title="October 14, 2007  7:11PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 15, 2007 3:47PM by Christian_Griffen.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James_Nostack</cite>Can someone who believes there's a significant difference between the 1981 Moldvay and the 1983 Mentzer version explain what the difference is?</blockquote>\nRules-wise, the Basic and Expert sets of these editions are identical.  (Except in later printings after the Companion, Masters and Immortals sets came out, in which the to-hit and saving throw charts changed a bit, I think)  The Mentzer edition was split into a players book and a DM's book, wheres the Moldvay/Cook editions were just single books.  The approaches that the two editions take are different.  The Mentzer Basic set starts off sort of spoonfeeding you rules info a little at a time, with a solo/gamebook style adventure to introduce them.  Moldvay takes the approach of "Here's how you make your character.  Here's how you explore. Here's how you fight.  Here are the monsters you can meet and here are the treasures you can find.  Here's how you DM and make your own adventures."  It was much more of a straightforward rulebook.  And the artwork was much more varied, which I liked far more than the Elmore work in the Mentzer books.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103048">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103048/#Comment_103048" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-14T19:49:30+00:00" title="October 14, 2007  7:49PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just checked in the garage, I've got the Blue book from the Expert Set here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103050">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103050/#Comment_103050" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-14T19:58:19+00:00" title="October 14, 2007  7:58PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Did anyone have experience playing with the "Immortals Rules" from the Mentzer version?

I've played games in the D&amp;D family twice.  The first was in 1990, when someone in the club I used to game at started an AD&amp;D 2nd ed game.  I didn't like the system and we went back to playing WFRP after two weeks.  The other time was at CONception in either 2004 or 2005 (I don't remember which) when I ended up playing in an OGL/d20 Conan Game.  It was a fun session, but from my POV that was despite the system, not because of it.  <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/account.php?u=399" rel="nofollow" title="Andrew Kenrick">Kenners</a> can probably tell you more, he was running the game.<br/><br/>So my past experience with D&amp;D is limited because it's never really appealed.  I started gaming with RuneQuest, Fighting Fantasy, Dragon Warriors and MERP.  The UK never really had the D&amp;D marketing that the US seemed to have and by the time I was gaming, Games Workshop were doing UK versions of a lot of stuff.  D&amp;D was pretty marginal in the circles I moved in as a kid.  By the late 80s it was all about WFRP and then the early 90s bought me to Shadowrun and then Vampire etc.  So I never did the D&amp;D thing, never owned a Red Box and never calculated a THAC0.<br/><br/>However, I did pick up a copy of Moldvay last week after Ben's evangelism on that podcast.<br/><br/>Reading through it is... interesting.  I'm approaching it the way I tend to approach indie/hippy games which is to say, with no pre-conceived ideas of how it should be played.  The text does a wonderful job of conveying what the game is about: there's no "story" bullshit - this is a game about adventuring and getting treasure.  The players are after the goodies in the dungeon and anything in their way is either going down, getting argued with or getting run away from.  If you try to look at this as some kind of rules for simulating medieval adventures, it breaks very badly.  The Alignment Languages make exactly fuck all sense for example.  But on the other hand, I've been playing games like Legend Of Zelda for just as long as I've been playing RPGs and I can deal with the fact that sometimes in a fictional world when you cut long grass there's just money there to be had.  I can deal with the rather bizarre economy in Hyrule, and I can deal with this sort of thing in D&amp;D too, as long as it's in a "That's Just How It Is" context.  In the same way, I can deal with the stupid "Forget a spell once you've cast it" and "'Veteran' Warriors often have few enough hitpoints to survive a single sword blow" rules.<br/><br/>I can seriously see this being quite a bit of fun if approached in the right way.  I intend to run it next Thursday, I'll probably run the adventure from the rulebook and we'll see how it goes.<br/><br/>I have to say though, there's one thing that bothers me: The idea of the game seems to be to go up in levels.  But from reading the book (and Ben/Rich/Vincent's experiences seem to back this up) is seems really bloody hard to actually survive long enough to get to second level!  Ah well, looks good for a laugh.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103087">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103087/#Comment_103087" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-15T09:58:15+00:00" title="October 15, 2007  9:58AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rich: It's really hard to survive to level two for a character.

Or should, ideally.<br/><br/>If 5 minute character creation is going to leave you uninvested and uninterested in trying to negotiate the challenges and wonders of the dungeon, then BX may not be the game for you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103138">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers" title="James Jeffers"><img alt="James Jeffers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers">James Jeffers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103138/#Comment_103138" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-15T17:54:34+00:00" title="October 15, 2007  5:54PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 15, 2007 5:54PM by James Jeffers.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps we can see some of the lurve at a convention near you?

I've run two dungeons in the last couple of days and have the following observations:<br><br>1. Ben is exactly right about the footprint of the game.  Both adventures took around than 2-2.5 hours.  Character creation is mostly randomized.  Yes, you get to pick a class, but depending on your rolls, certain classes might not even be available to you.<br/><br/>2. Letting the game be what it is works.  The way I read the rules, dungeons are all you have in the basic book -- the wilderness rules are in the Expert book.  So all adventures, by definiton, start in media res.  You can fill in backstory as you go, but you're immediately in situation.  The players have some immediate goals laid out in front of them (stay alive, try to complete the over-arching 'mission', get treasure (for the XP!), etc).  And the reactions (Talk, Fight, Run or Wait) make their options crystal clear.<br/><br/>3. The randomizer is interesting.  It basically develops up set-pieces.  There's a room.  Does it have anything interesting in it?   If it does, see if it's a monster, a trap, or something special.  Now see if there's treasure in it.  Treasure is appropriate to monster-type if there are any.  Repeat.  As the adventurers explore, they hit set-piece after set-piece (along with whatever you've put in the dungeon because you want it there), with some down-time (corridors, in which they might hit wandering monsters) in between.<br/><br/>4. The game eats level one characters for lunch, then roars for more.  I think we lost something like 4 or 5 characters in the course of an adventure.  They started dropping like flies from the very first encounter.  The first time it happened, I said the players could run back to town and come back a few weeks later (it actually worked well story-wise).  They came back with more people.  More people died.  Like instanteously.<br/><br/>5. The randomizer is really, really random.  Like insanely random.  See AP below.<br/><br/>6. The combat is deadly, deadly boring.  Which is odd, given the above.  You'd think that since it's so kill-friendly, it would be interesting/nerve-wracking/exciting.  But I didn't find it so.  Combat is basically Rock-em Sock-em Robots.  The DM and the players are rolling a d6 (initiative) then a d20 (to hit) over and over again until one of them gets a certain target number.  One might have a slight advantage over the other, depending on AC (you have to roll at least 17, I have to roll at least 15), but that's about it.  Hit points are so low at this level that the d6/d8 you roll for damage can sometimes seem superfluous.  When you hit, apparently, you hit HARD.<br/><br/>I'll post an AP next.<br/><br/>-d-                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104008">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/peccable" title="peccable"><img alt="peccable" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/peccable">peccable</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104008/#Comment_104008" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-21T06:53:58+00:00" title="October 21, 2007  6:53AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I first brought up the Moldvay edition to my partner, I did it with the understanding that this was the game he, quite literally, grew up with.  The Moldvay edition was the one he'd bought for his friend when he was a kid and they proceeded to play it obsessively.  They eventually graduated to the Expert set, then on to Advanced D&amp;D, etc, etc.  So nostalgia was definitely present.<br/><br/>For me it, was pretty different.  Yes, D&amp;D was my first role-playing game (I started with AD&amp;D second edition), but I pretty much stopped in High School and never look back (I 'graduated' to White Wolf's games, if that's the right word, then got over my undergrad emo phase and put *those* long behind me), but I never felt any real nostalgia for the actual system.  Settings?  Absolutely.  I'd still love to play the Planescape again someday -- just not using D&amp;D.<br/><br/>We tried out the Moldvay generator one-on-one and had fun.  Quick, simple trip into a temple (the mission was 'Exploring the Unknown') that had long been abandonded by one of the character's sect.  They eventually find the zombified ancestor of the other character and have to kill him.  They end up with a Staff of Healing.  Definitely fun, though I noted that concealed/secret doors are REALLY HARD TO FIND, even for Elves.  <br/><br/>So then we mentioned this to our friend Dan, who mentioned he'd listened to the podcast where Ben talked about old-skool D&amp;D and we decided to try it again.<br/><br/>I used the generator (in the meantime I'd coded-up a computer version of it) to roll up an adventure with about six rooms of encounters.  We went with 'Destroying an Ancient Evil'.  Four characters, two players: the Cleric and Elf from the first adventure (minus staff -- we said this was a flashback before that adventure) played by Neil, and a thief and a mage played by Dan.  The first two were Lawful and Neutral, the second two were Chaotic (this became important).  They're exploring a burial ground holy to the Cleric.<br/><br/>The very first thing I roll up is a group of 3 Dwarves.  Dwarves have Type-G treasure.  The generator says they have treasure.  I roll against the G treasure table and see that they have 6,000 platinum pieces.  Which means they have 30,000 gold pieces.  Which means these three characters (one of whom rolled 1 HP on his 1 HD) are worth 30,000 XP.  To get to the next level from 1, you need about 1,200 - 1,500 depending on class, and then it usually doubles from then on. Which means these dwarves were worth 4-5 levels of XP.<br/><br/>I did a double-take at that.  That seems absolutely insane to me, but I went with it.  <br/><br/>So the encounter goes something like this:<br/><br/>Thief is sent forward to scout (he succeeds on his roll), sees the dwarves ahead, arguing amongst themselves.  One is really wounded (1 hp!) and is trying to get the others to leave.  The other two look like they're hanging back.  I roll morale to see what happens -- they decide to leave, right through the party who is still at the entrance.<br/><br/>Thief runs back to warn the party.  They're ready, the dwarves are surprised.  Roll reaction -- uncertain, but holding their place.  The cleric speaks Lawful alignment to them.  It turns out there's a dwarven stronghold underneath the area they're exploring.  These dwarves were travelling to get to it, but were waylaid and lost the rest of their party.  The Cleric (undiplomatically) asks them if they're carrying anything they took from the burial grounds.<br/><br/>The head dwarf places his hand on his warhammer and says that no, they didn't, and that they're leaving now.<br/><br/>Which is when the Mage (who couldn't understand a word of what was being said) decided to rip the dwarf's head off with a Magic Missile (he rolled ridiculously high).<br/><br/>Battle ensues, morale is rolled (and passed), and the dwarves fight to the death, killing the Mage and the Cleric in the process.<br/><br/>The surviving Elf and Thief search the bodies and discover they're wealthy beyond their wildest dreams.<br/><br/>We could, quitely literally, have ended it there.  Why on Earth press on into an obviously insanely dangerous area (they lost two of their party on the first encounter) when you can go home and count your 15,000 GP?<br/><br/>We role-played the Elf and Thief talking out what they would do.  The Mage, it turns out, was the idiot cousin of the Thief (who's got tons of idiot cousins, as you'll see), and he has no problem burying him and walking off with his loot.

They spend their gold.  They level up to level 2 (it didn't seem right for them to be able to level up to a level beyond Basic before we even got to the second room of the adventure), and then come back with two other characters: a hugely buffed Fighter, another cousin of the Thief (he rolled *really* well -- 17 16 16 I think) and another member of the Cleric's sect.  The Thief convinces his cousin to quit the army and come with him by telling him stories of weak Dwarves wandering about with tons of money.  The Cleric is a dour, suspicious man who seems to be along to find out what really happened to the first Cleric.<br/><br/>At this point, we realized the story was really about the Elf's descent from Neutral to Chaotic.  The whole game became more and more about justifications for covering up what they did to the dwarves (they ended up not telling anyone about the platinum) and their greed for more stuff.  At some point someone said it felt like a medieval version of Reservoir Dogs.<br/><br/>The party heads further into the burial grounds and stumbles upon the hive of 3 Killer Bees.  The Thief cowers behind the FIghter who bravely steps forward and slices at the creature.  The creature stings him.  I glance over the rules for Killer Bees.  They die when they sting, but then the character they hit has to roll a Save against Poison.  Oh, ok, and then they lose HP?  No...I read further.  They roll against Poison...or DIE.<br/><br/>I blinked a couple of times at that one.  Regardless of level, a character stung by a 1/2 HD creature can die if they don't get their saving throw.  (The creature, with this insane power, is worth something like 8 XP).<br/><br/>So hugely buffed armored Fighter dude died in the first 15 seconds of the second run through the dungeon.<br/><br/>They kill the rest of them bees.  They find the hive has magical honey (heals 1-4 hp) in it.  They press on.<br/><br/>They come upon the central area of the burial ground.  The encounter I rolled was a talking statue.  So I decide it's a statue of the Cleric's goddess.  It starts chanting a litany of the Elf and Thief's sins (liars, thieves, desecrators, etc).  The Cleric falls to his knees in wonder.  The Thief decides to hit him in the back with a crossbow bolt before he realizes what the statue is saying and turns on him and the Elf.  He misses.<br/><br/>We kind of looked at each other at that point.  I asked Neil for the Cleric's character sheet and we played out the battle, with the Cleric now a Monster according to the rules.<br/><br/>They end up killing the Cleric.  Dan looked up at me at that point and said "How much XP do you think he's worth?"<br/><br/>They search the tombs to find they've been already looted.  Oh -- so <b>that's</b> where the platinum came from.  The characters look at each other, shrug, then stuff the body of the cleric in a tomb and set it on fire using a vial of oil.  No evidence left.<br/><br/>The randomizer says they hit an alarm that brings a monster.  I roll on the Wandering Monster table and end up with 8 Acolytes.  Perfect.<br/><br/>The now shouting statue brings a group of suspicious clerics who are also here to find out what's going on in the burial grounds.  An uncomfortable exchange ensues.  Just as the matter seems to be headed to blows, they hear sounds to the south.<br/><br/>What happened here was that I just decided to throw the remaining encounters together.<br/><br/>They find a group of hurt dwarves (yup, I rolled dwarves again -- these didn't have treasure, though) surrounded by 11 wolves.  Yes, eleven.  That's what I rolled.<br/><br/>Battle ensues.  To make it interesting, I played the wolves, the players played everyone else.<br/><br/>The wolves are obviously supernatural.  They go after the Acolytes when they can, but avoid their leader, who seems to have a glowing holy symbol.<br/><br/>Several Acolytes die, but in the end, the wolves are defeated.<br/><br/>And the characters are again confronted with their sins.<br/><br/>At which point they ran away.  The End.<br/><br/>We could have continued -- in fact Dan said he wanted to find out what happened to these guys and the Dwarven stronghold and the Ancient Evil to which the wolves were obviously connected but I decided was probably a couple levels further down.  Fun was definitely had by all.<br/><br/>I don't know if I'd do it again, though.  Like I said, my biggest complaints are the difficulty and the fact that I really didn't like the combat system.  The thing is - could you have a (in my view) fun, interesting combat system which still had the tiny footprint for character and dungeon creation this version of D&amp;D provides?<br/><br/>-d-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104016">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104016/#Comment_104016" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-21T08:06:27+00:00" title="October 21, 2007  8:06AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Daniel, thank you so much for posting this!

Bear in mind that this is the first time I've ever run any variation of D&amp;D, so I was very unsure of how things were supposed to work.<br/><br/>I ran the players through the adventure in the back of the book, which is an example of how to build dungeons.  It's something like 9 rooms with mostly goblins in.  Actually it's most nothing in the rooms, but there are two rooms of Goblins, one of Hobgoblins and a green slime (also a Crab Spider, but the players did not go that way).<br/><br/>Character creation was a bit of a faff.  Bearing in mind that there were 3 players and the game is clearly designed with parties of 5-8 characters in mind.  It was decided to have two characters each, for a party of 6 characters.  I've never created a D&amp;D character before and neither had Claire.  Dave had played Moldvay as a kid, but that's at least 20 years ago.  Greg had played AD&amp;D in the 80s, but nothing since.  Creating 6 characters took quite some time.  Stats were rolled, then rolled again (because Dave managed to get two "hopeless" characters in a row).  Classes were chosen for these vestigial characters, but given that Claire's never played a game with character classes before and neither Dave nor Greg have an understanding of how the classes work in this version of the game it was fairly time consuming.  They ended up with an obvious Elf and Dwarf, an obvious Thief and three characters who were firmly average.  They ended up being a Halfling, a cleric and a Magic User for fairly arbitrary reasons.  Next came the fairly fiddly "attribute Adjustment" thing and the noting of bonuses, special class abilities and what they meant.  Then there was the whole "shopping for equipment" thing, which wasn't so bad because the list of equipment is mercifully short.<br/><br/>In all, the character creation took quite a while.  Probably an hour in total, although it seemed longer.  Things would go a lot quicker if we ever do it again, because people now understand roughly what does what.<br/><br/>The players ended up with one character they liked each and one which they had zero investment in.  Restricting them to one character each might help with this, but I suspect that I'd just end up with players who like their characters feeling invested in them and those who didn't feeling excluded and disenfranchised, but there you are.<br/><br/>Play was fun, but very random.  The players seemed to use the "spare" characters as cannon fodder to clear the way for their "proper" characters.  Dave had the Cleric (with, y'know, no spells <b>at all</b>) skipping merrily down a corridor with gaye abandon ahead of the party because the characters stats were rubbish and he expected her to trigger any traps and die.  She had a very low Int score, which is why such a tactic seemed appropriate.  there was some fun in character conversations on the topic.  As it happens, she did die, but it was at the hands of some Goblins who surprised the players coming out of another room and just plain old bad luck which is very unforgiving in this game.  The Thief (Shifty McSneak) proved very effective with her longbow despite having her leather armour destroyed in an encounter with the green slime.  Grupp the Dwarf seemed to be an effective fighter and Leaf-Leaf the Elf was generally pretty useful to have around.<br/><br/>I dunno, we had fun, but I think that it'll be more fun next time.  Now that I've seen things in action I think I can make use of the random tables and stuff and let the game breathe a bit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104123">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/peccable" title="peccable"><img alt="peccable" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/peccable">peccable</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104123/#Comment_104123" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-22T07:27:20+00:00" title="October 22, 2007  7:27AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First, James: thanks for the feedback.

I quite literally stared right through the "ADJUSTMENTS TO TREASURE" section on page B45.  You've got it exactly right -- that treasure listing is for a complete complex.  The amount of treasure suddenly makes a lot more sense.<br/><br/>I presume you divide the total number by the number of dwarfs in an imagined complex (roll 5d8) and then divy out the money amongst the ones the party actually fights?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite><br/>2) Why was morale rolled prior to the party actually encountering the dwarfs and fighting?

They hadn't encountered the party yet, but I needed a way to figure out if they'd continue out of the dungeon or go back and look for their fellows.  Morale seemed appropriate.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite><br/>3) Why the assumption thast 1 hp= wounded?

"There's one up front that look weaker/smaller than the rest"?  Or does it simply not come up?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite><br/>"Character creation is mostly randomized.

It's the "you can't lower skills below 9" rule that really gets you.  You're definitely going to be limited in what effective characters you can make based on your rolls ("High strength?  OK, this one's a fighter.").\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite><br/>5) Many types of vermin are shockingly deadly, like your killer bees. Save vs. Poison or die is a big deal.<br/></blockquote>\nWhoo boy, yes.  It seems to me an experienced player would just run when they see something like this.  <br/><br/>Is that the point, really?  Certain monsters just aren't worth the fight, and since XP from gold/treasure is just worth so much more you need to run away from certain things and pick your battles? <br/><br/>By the rules as written, the very best you're going to get from an encounter with Killer Bees is the magic healing honey (which isn't even as good as a real Potion of Healing).  The bees themselves are 1/2 HD creatures with one special ability (which is to KILL YOU INSTANTLY), which, according to the XP table makes them worth 6 XP a piece!  I can't believe that poison skill is worth a single XP per creature.  I'd much rather fight a 2+HD creature and end up getting 25XP per, plus any treasure it's carrying...<br/><br/>*blink*<br/><br/>Wow.

I'm not entirely sure myself. The flip possibility that I've tried is that the Big Pile o' Lewt (tm) is actually in the Big Man's chest/mattress/underwear drawer, and that individuals have some minor walkin' around money on them.<br/><br/>That makes a bit more sense in combination with the comments on the morale roll, where ransoming prisoners is implied as relatively normal, even with chaotic critters.\n<blockquote>The dwarfs (dwarfs? dwarves? I feel like the princes from 'Into the Woods' <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> ) were moving through the dungeon after being attacked by the wolves. They hadn't encountered the party yet, but I needed a way to figure out if they'd continue out of the dungeon or go back and look for their fellows. Morale seemed appropriate.</blockquote>\nFair enough. Moldvay BD&amp;D ( like many games of the era) tends to expect the GMs to make up stuff on the fly, based on existing rules.\n<blockquote>*shrug* I know rolled HP have nothing to do with damage, but looking at the other encounters they party was going to come across (the wolves), it seemed appropriate.<br/><br/>How does a DM normally talk about low-HP monsters (those that roll badly on their HD)? "There's one up front that look weaker/smaller than the rest"? Or does it simply not come up?</blockquote>\nI guess it could be either. I've experimented with straight rolls recently and had some weirdness result, such as the secondary Big Bad in an adventure (a 3rd level cleric) ending up with 7 HPs. I do think that a lot of BD&amp;D's flavor comes from trying to make sense out of the randmness generated, so I can see how the wolves+ 1 HP dwarf= wounded in a  previous encounter.\n<blockquote><br/>While you're literally correct about the rules, running, as you noted, an INT 3 Magic User is problematic at the very least. It's the "you can't lower skills below 9" rule that really gets you. You're definitely going to be limited in what effective characters you can make based on your rolls ("High strength? OK, this one's a fighter.").</blockquote>\nWe ran into some of this with my group recently. IMO (strictly), a modifier of less than +/- 2 is largely irrelevant anyway, but it is a <i>very big deal <b></b></i>to players.<br/><br/>As to the lowering skills below 9, my group has been using a bunch of Stat tests against a d20, and low stats or even mediocre ones can end up being deadly.\n<blockquote>Whoo boy, yes. It seems to me an experienced player would just run when they see something like this.</blockquote>\nYep. Embarassing, but true.\n<blockquote>Is that the point, really? Certain monsters just aren't worth the fight, and since XP from gold/treasure is just worth so much more you need to run away from certain things and pick your battles?</blockquote>\nThat's my impression. I suspect that's also the genesis of "mission" xps and xps for "defeating" critters/encounters without necessarily killing the critters.<br/><br/>Honestly, almost no monsters are worth killing in BD&amp;D. The monsters that would pop up a level in xps are <b>way</b> beyond your capabilities.<br/><br/>Loot, OTOH, is <b>always</b> worthwhile. I mean, if you can force a goblin to give you 6 gps for sparing its life, you're ahead of the game. Besides, you can always mug him a second time if he's still alive.<br/><br/>Say, maybe that's why Lawful Heroes are so tough! They keep defeating the same fellows over and over and letting them go, while the Chaotics kill 'em off and are done with it!<br/><br/>Also, I suspect your dwarfs point to part of the answer as well. Killer Bees are basically just an environmental hazard on the way to the real loot, just like traps and pits and so on. Theoretically, you get rewarded stupidly heavily for acing the final or semi-final Big Bad.<br/><br/>[Of course, this mentality on my part also led to a 2/3 Party Kill with something like 250 xps and 200-ish GPs to show for it last time I GMed. Rather embarassing for me, I admit.]\n<blockquote>We played with miniatures, by the by.

Roll, miss, roll, miss, roll, miss, roll, hit. Oh, now you're dead.<br/></blockquote>\nI find them a bit dry myself, but I think they'd be even drier without some nod to the environment. For actual play, I'm more and more tempted to suggest to my crew that we steal ideas (feats, the IH stuff that was mentioned) from more modern incarnations of D&amp;D and simply use them as modifiers rather than getting very in-depth.<br/><br/>Minis use is a bit strange to me, coming from a background of largely dropping rpgs in favor of minis games for about a decade or so. Before really getting into minis games, my D&amp;D combats were a bit like you described-roll until someone dies. After playing minis games, I tend to think about things like ganging up, flanks, cheaty tactics, high-ground, all kinds of stuff really ( and the way rpgs work actually let that stuff matter more than in most minis games).<br/><br/>Personally, I'd throw in some easy modifiers as quick house-rules. Some are already suggested for cover, and a very sort of one-sentence discussion of other modifiers occurs in the combat section of the rules, so you aren't totally without justification. I'd be careful about mods more than +/- 3, however. I don't believe much in the way opf damage mods are discussed at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104173">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Peterson" title="Chris Peterson"><img alt="Chris Peterson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cpeterso.com/html/img/merman-confounded.200x200.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Peterson">Chris Peterson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104173/#Comment_104173" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-22T11:47:07+00:00" title="October 22, 2007 11:47AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for sharing this BD&amp;D AP.

I think that's how you get most out of this game - using those arbitrary, random rolls to  inspire story elements and interesting encounters.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's interesting hearing people's opinions on the combat. I'm curious to what extent the boredom is inherent to the system (there's no real way to affect your chances of hitting, or change the outcomes of hitting, even at a cost) and whether it can be circumvented through dungeon design. There was a design and development article for 4th edition talking about how now they try to design dungeons where there's lots of room to manouevre and multiple routes for enemies to approach the PCs, to make full use of positioning and movement (<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drdd/20070827a" rel="nofollow">here it is</a>). I wonder if, in basic D&amp;D;, that would be enough to spice things up, or if the core combat mechanic needs some love. I certainly remember some frustrating times with D&amp;D; games when fighting high-AC enemies, and just missing round after round, with not a lot of other options.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm going to be running a game of this soon, too (it spreads like a plague!) and I think I'm going to drastically reduce the amount of xp needed to gain a level. It'll only be a one-off game, and levelling is fun - I want it to happen at least once during the session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104193/#Comment_104193" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-22T14:26:10+00:00" title="October 22, 2007  2:26PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What if you instituted some kind of director-stance madness, like in Donjon or Sorcerer?  Player either invents something in the scene to give a nifty bonus or strategic option, or through success manages to modify the situation to make it more dynamic?  This probably does violence to the BD&amp;D; authority breakdown--and hell, if you're borrowing from Donjon why not just play Donjon?--but it might make the play more collaborative and interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nY'know what's kind of cool, though?  The whole deadliness thing, and the pointlessness of fighting certain monsters, really hits some of the literature.  In modern verisons of D&amp;D;, it's kind of like a First Person Slicer: you run around, and if you see any monsters moving you can probably mow them down without too much trouble.  But a lot of the time in fantasy fiction even bad-asses like Conan, Elric, and Fafhrd are like, "Shit!  I'm not fighting <i>that</i>!  Let's get the hell out of here while we still can."  Maybe playing BD&amp;D; like it was a lo-fi fantasy version of Doom is completely sub-optimal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE

I'm curious to what extent the boredom is inherent to the system (there's no real way to affect your chances of hitting, or change the outcomes of hitting, even at a cost) and whether it can be circumvented through dungeon design. There was a design and development article for 4th edition talking about how now they try to design dungeons where there's lots of room to manouevre and multiple routes for enemies to approach the PCs, to make full use of positioning and movement (<a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drdd/20070827a" rel="nofollow">here it is</a>). I wonder if, in basic D&amp;D, that would be enough to spice things up, or if the core combat mechanic needs some love.</blockquote>\nI certainly think you could add a bit (modifiers, trading off to-hit minus for damage bonus, cool narration, etc) without seriously upsetting the system. It might be worth considering tactics that don't require that, however. Again, it might actually help to have some hirelings at low level to pull that stuff off properly.\n<blockquote>I'm going to be running a game of this soon, too (it spreads like a plague!) and I think I'm going to drastically reduce the amount of xp needed to gain a level. It'll only be a one-off game, and levelling is fun - I want it to happen at least once during the session.</blockquote>\nI'm curious what you'll come up with.

For instance, she wanted her human character to be a fighter-MU, and as we started out going fully by the book, that meant "Elf." We discussed that maybe Elf was just her class, but that combined to a low CHA roll led her to come up with "Okay, she's badly scarred from a fire, other people don't even *know* she's an elf." This led me to decide my generic Cleric was part of a monastic order that had nursed her back to health, and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe adventure is the sample in my old version of Basic, the one with the ruined castle and the carrion crawler and the kobolds. So now she's telling me what the Situation is here: her character's been masquerading as an innocent victim, but the reason these two are out adventuring is that she's pulling a scam -- she's got this hapless guy eating out of her hand, and has talked him into heading out into this ruin to try to reclaim it for their order. The clear, unstated, and totally false assumption is that she's going to donate her share of the haul to the church. This arrangement starts to break down about five minutes into the game, and pretty much takes over the session.<br/>\n<br/>\nI won't get into all the details of the session, but overall my impression was that the dungeoncrawling and combat bits, the stuff that used system, showed up to put our heroes into a bad situation, and the payoff of play was the dealing with this chaos and how it's affecting the whole 'we're a party' thing. That stuff, which is 'just roleplaying', was the majority of the session. I got a kick out of this because our group typically plays with tight scene framing and mechanics involved in whatever the real conflict of a scene is -- and here the 'game' was the talking back and forth, and it turned out that my wife was pretty much running the show there. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> She basically picked up co-DMing duties for anything that wasn't mechanical.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt felt a bit like using D&amp;D; to set the scene for various bits of improv'ed dialogue, and that's a pretty entertaining game, especially against someone who has none of the classical assumptions of how to crawl a dungeon. (She did pick right up on 10 foot poles and pushing the hireling ahead of you, without prompting.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104356">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arminius" title="Arminius"><img alt="Arminius" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/588/nMC0KH12ZK6VM.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arminius">Arminius</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104356/#Comment_104356" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-23T11:52:29+00:00" title="October 23, 2007 11:52AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James_Nostack</cite>"Shit!

Each played two characters, and we had two elves (Quickleaf and Giltleaf), a cleric (Karn) and a thief (Benny Lightfingers).  The adventure was the sample from the back of the book - the first level of an abandoned keep, infested by goblins (and in theory, underground wererats).  I described a little bit about the keep, and then asked the players to tell me why their characters were there.  It turned out that one of the elves had caught the thief trying to break into his room at the inn, and forced him to swear an oath of loyalty.  The thief had heard their was treasure in the old keep, and the elves were curious.  The cleric had heard there was an old chapel there, and wanted to reconsecrate the place.  Luckily, there was already a desecrated chapel in the adventure - if there hadn't been, I would have dropped one in somewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe old keep was pretty brutal.  We had several encounters.  The first was with a 5' spider lurking on the opposite side of a hanging tapestry that the party tried to pull down.  In the ensuing scuffle, the spider ripped the head off Quickleaf.  Alas.  Later, the characters met a green slime, and ran away, slamming the door, and lining the crack with burning oil to keep it from flowing out after them.  The final encounter was with 12 goblins living in the desecrated chapel.  The remaining elf sent half of them to sleep, but they were soon woken up by their colleagues, and the party was overwhelmed.  RIP.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll in all, it was a successful venture.  My friends had fun, the rules ran quite smoothly, and I know several other people who want to try it, so we'll definitely play again.  We had a few problems, however.  First, the rules seem to imply that EVERY door in the entire dungeon is (if unlocked) stuck and needs to be bashed open, and unless propped immediately closes and gets stuck again.  That seems frustrating and somewhat purposeless.  Anyone know what it's there for?  (also?  thieves suck at unlocking things and dealing with traps.  Better not rely on either of those things occurring...)  Second, the rules for movement in combat are REALLY unclear.  On the one hand, the action order seems to imply that if you and I are fighting in melee, and you win the initiative, I get to wait until you spend your move, and then move away  when it's my turn so you can't close with me.  On the other hand, however, the rules for retreating in combat very clearly imply that when you retreat, your foe gets a parting whack at you.  We handled it by saying that what happens in the movement phase is that one declares where one plans on moving, and that you actually move later on in the turn when things make sense, but I'd love to know the "official" explanation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105351">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105351/#Comment_105351" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-29T09:16:00+00:00" title="October 29, 2007  9:16AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A few thoughts on doors:<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, by making it almost certain an open door will close, it eliminates a huge amount of book keeping on the part of the GM. Think about how hard it would be to keep track of which doors are open and which are closed in a large dungeon.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thought is that having doors be closed by default and tough to open or keep open, action is constrained to a small locality. By constraining the action at any given time to a small area makes the game easier to manage. It also helps deal with some of the problems of the close proximity of monsters in the dungeon where logic defies why they would be any where near each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaking it hard for the PCs to open doors also makes sure exploration takes time, which means more random encounters, and perhaps a more interesting resource management problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs the text describing doors automatically opening for the monsters still in there?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is interesting to see various bits and pieces still in the rules when the game (as presented in the text) has drifted away from the "mega-dungeons" (a many level dungeon that is designed to be the setting for an entire campaign) that were the way the game started (at least Gygax's campaign) when those bits and pieces make the most sense for mega-dungeons (but then to some extent, I feel that can be said of the whole rules set).<br/>\n<br/>\nFrank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105910">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/peccable" title="peccable"><img alt="peccable" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/peccable">peccable</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105910/#Comment_105910" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-01T08:43:30+00:00" title="November  1, 2007  8:43AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If anyone's interested, I've created an online (PHP-based) Moldvay dungeon generator.
