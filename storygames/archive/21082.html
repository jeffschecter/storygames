Not really free-form like Fate or Over the Edge (a system I really like) more specific to your class.<br/><br/>It started out as this:<br/><br/>STRENGTH = FIGHT<br/>DEXTERITY = SNEAK<br/>CONSTITUTION = SURVIVE<br/>WISDOM = BLESS<br/>INTELLIGENCE = CAST<br/>CHARISMA = CHARM<br/><br/>But then I thought about taking it a bit further. Why does a Thief need CAST if you're not using magic? Or a magic-user having bless?<br/><br/>How about a 'You Pick Six' or UPS system;-) where you choose the six most important abilities for your class.<br/><br/>So, for example, a Fighter will have some different abilities than say a Cleric.<br/><br/>There would be the typical pre-packaged classes. But you could customize easily as well. <br/><br/>I would have a seventh stat called luck, which covers rolls outside of those defined by your six ability scores. <br/><br/>Let's say you have a magic-user with no fighting ability. Roll equal/under Luck stat. But you're really only going to want to use this as a last option, because there is a severe chance of critical failure. But at the same time, there's always a chance for success.<br/><br/>Basically, to take an action roll equal or under your ability. It's like Pendragon where you want to roll as high as you can, without rolling over. But there is a difference in that there is a lower threshold as well (like Unknown Armies, but using a d20). Also you automatically miss/fail with a 1.<br/><br/>Back to the magic-user with a Luck score of 11. You unfortunately are in a combat situation and are forced to use a knife to fight off an enemy. This is where Luck comes in. To hit the enemy you need to roll an 11 or under. But you also have a +4 modifier which goes at the bottom. So you would need to roll 6-11 to succeed (1 is always a failure +4 for the modifier).<br/><br/>For spells the Magic-User uses Cast. Let's say you have a 15. Roll 'between' for the spell to be cast. 15 is a critical success (you could have 1 always as a critical failure). Also the level of spell counts as a modifier. You are casting a 1st level spell, the roll needs to be 3-15 to succeed. A 2nd level spell is 4-15 and so on. If you roll above the number nothing bad happens, you simply didn't cast it. However a roll below causes some sort of misfire (that's where some fun tables or ad lib comes in).<br/><br/>There are three saves (similar to that in 3e D&amp;D) which covers reactions. Not sure if these should be specific to classes as well. Again you could use luck to cover anything outside of these using the same principle.<br/><br/>Thoughts?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462430">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462430/#Comment_462430" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-25T06:31:47+00:00" title="April 25, 2017  6:31AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my game, I use str for athletics and brute force attacks, dex for sneaking and finesse attacks (including shooting), con for surviving hardships, wis for detecting sneaking people and avoiding surprised, plus as a caster stat for some classes.

Also, deductive and reasoning abilities of the character.<br/><b>Social:</b> these could actually be on any other of the spots due to their utility, but the particular way these are played and interpreted on the game earned them their own spot.<br/><br/>The advantage for this categorization is that it's easier to implement and balance a fate-like system where PCs can have and mix any type of common and supernatural skills however they want. For example, this way you can realize the real value of a vampiric ability that both damages the opponent (attack) and heals yourself (defense) and makes the player pay the actual value for it instead of getting two abilities for the price of one.<br/><br/>Common sense and roleplaying still limit the usefullness of an ability on a particular situation, though this system is more geared to balance things like invisibility being utterly better than mastery of stealth, or a mix of both.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462478">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462478/#Comment_462478" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-26T11:06:54+00:00" title="April 26, 2017 11:06AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't you think that you're basically abandoning the concept of the "ability" (something everybody has to different degrees) in favour of "skill" (something you might or might not have) with this direction, though? I mean to say, it seems to me that with custom abilities you basically just have a skill list and the conceit that the player needs to pick precisely six of the skills for their character, with one actual ability - Luck - to cover the bases on what a character might lack.<br/><br/>Not that this is a bad thing, mind, but it may be useful to notice that this is what's going on so as to develop the idea to its fullest extent. There are interesting things one can do with skills as well, after all.<br/><br/>I might suggest that you could ditch Luck if you used character level and/or saving rolls instead. Character level is already supposed to be the most general depiction of character ability/importance/luck/narrative weight available, so it's sort of redundant to have both a Luck score and a level from that perspective. Remember how older D&amp;D flavours have saving throws scaling with level, and how saves are used for all kinds of luck-based determinations. Also, how hit points are often conceptualized as "luck", and those scale with level as well; it's not an exaggeration to say that in D&amp;D luck or fate is usually modeled by character level.<br/><br/>A simple way to use pure level in this mechanical context is to say that a character's Luck target number is 10+level (so 11 for 1st level characters and going up from there - 5 for 0th levels) and that they roll on it as if they had the skill in question, except that any successes are only half as effective (or you need to roll twice to amass a full success), and any failures are twice as bad. You'll only want to use this as a last resort, of course.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462480/#Comment_462480" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-26T11:38:22+00:00" title="April 26, 2017 11:38AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, the good thing, if well designed (I'm not onboard with vgunn's list yet) is that the rest can be "To do it do it".

It'd be a lot more formalistic than D&amp;D traditionally tends to be, but that also means more focus in what you actually want to do. I imagine the end result to resemble the various dungeoneering fantasy games that have come out of the Forge diaspora over the years - Agon, Labyrinths &amp; Lycanthropes, Dungeon World, that sort of thing. For some people it's not that big a step, but for me these are an entirely different class of game from D&amp;D - fine and worthy games, of course.<br/><br/>The big technical, theoretical step is over the threshold where you decide (if you do) that there shall be no emergent task simulation rulings made at the table - the skill list is what it is, there's a generic case rule for handling stuff that drops in the cracks ("anything that doesn't have a skill dedicated to it is automatic success" is a good one), and the gameplay is actively formulated to ensure that things ultimately boil down to those attack, sneaking, casting checks that rest at the center of the game. This is totally a different ballgame from the way that the D&amp;D mainline construes the entire affair of mechanizing task resolution.<br/><br/>(Certain modern versions of D&amp;D are pretty close to this already; 4th edition is particularly formalistic. The general consensus of the tradition is highly organic, though.)<br/><br/>Thinking about the ability (skill) list, a feeling I personally have is that I would reduce the number of abilities per character, or structure picking them in some more detailed way than just "pick six out of a list" (or take a pre-picked list in the form of an established character class, of course). I feel that three or so per character should be enough, and result in a tighter feel.<br/><br/>Like, I would expect that a perfectly serviceable fighter type could start out with "Fight" and "Survive". Maybe you have a couple of fighter classes to begin with, and they all have those two in common, but paladins also get "Bless" and rangers/ninjas get "Sneak" and cavaliers get "Charm". Anything not on your list, you do the Luck check mambo, or whatever ancillary procedures one cares to provide.<br/><br/>And maybe at 3rd level or so you get to pick between multiclassing or switching out one of your class skills for an improved version. Some mid-levelers have a fourth skill, while others have an improved version of their old one. Trade "Fight" for "Kung-Fu" for example (with the understanding that the latter does everything the former did, plus more, rather than being a more narrow specialization).<br/><br/>No reason why this couldn't be grounds for a fun, light mechanical chassis for D&amp;D-like hijinks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462483">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462483/#Comment_462483" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-26T13:14:32+00:00" title="April 26, 2017  1:14PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>And maybe at 3rd level or so you get to pick between multiclassing or switching out one of your class skills for an improved version.

There gotta be a better way of solving auto-fail.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Those were my thoughts when reading your post. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462500/#Comment_462500" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-26T16:32:41+00:00" title="April 26, 2017  4:32PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 26, 2017 4:33PM by BeePeeGee.">edited April 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, these are my categories for replacing D&amp;D stats (I use them mostly as alternatives to Fate Accelerated Approaches):<br/>- COMBAT<br/>- ROGUE<br/>- CONCENTRATION<br/>- SOCIETY<br/>- WILDERNESS / SCOUTING<br/>- INTUITION<br/><br/>This works pretty well for me (except maybe the term "rogue", perhaps something like "thievery" is beter).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462502">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462502/#Comment_462502" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-26T17:44:05+00:00" title="April 26, 2017  5:44PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the interest of sharing ability arrays, here's mine:<br/><br/>STAMINA<br/>WITS<br/>KNOWLEDGE<br/>WILL<br/>CHARISMA<br/><br/>I use this set for D&amp;D specifically.

When are they typically rolled, in your game?</blockquote>\nThey're quite distinct, and intended to be easily and intuitively understood as part of the initial design. I had several priorities in choosing this stat array, but one of the earliest ones was to create a breakdown of character that was simultaneously realistic, usable and compelling (that is, the numbers provide clear indications of what your character is like as a human being). A secondary priority was to make all abilities compelling and useful - not because players would min-max between them and I wanted tough choices (they're randomized initially), but rather because I wanted the choice of character class to be a real choice no matter your stat array, and that's not true if every fighter wants high Strength and the other stats can go hang.<br/><br/><b>WITS</b> is how quick-thinking and alert your character is. It's used for spot checks (lots of those in D&amp;D), initiative, practical magic and certain types of skilled work. There are various ways to leverage WITS in combat as well (replacing STAMINA in attack rolls, etc.) High WITS indicates potential for the character to be a "clever" hero, and I feel that it works pretty well as a roleplaying indicator and a source of color.<br/><br/><b>WILL</b> is how certain and self-knowledgeable your character is. It's used the least of all the five stats (and I have considered dropping it from the array, but the players have generally resisted that), but it has its uses in carrying on in the face of adversity (e.g. you take an injury in a fight but refuse to go down), resisting temptations and commanding others; it is also the primary magic stat in that most types of magic tend to start with it when checks are needed. Again, I think it's pretty easy for people to get a sense for what it means for their character to have a low or high WILL, insofar as the fiction goes.<br/><br/><b>KNOWLEDGE</b> or "Experience" as one could translate it (in Finnish it's "Sivistys", 'Erudition') -  is simply a gestalt of the character's schooling and experience. It's used in knowledge checks (figuring out what your character knows about thing X) and as a basis of various skill checks. Depending on character background a high score may indicate e.g. formal schooling or a varied career path.<br/><br/>If I were to go to a four-stat array, it'd be by combining WILL and CHARISMA into a single stat. They're not quite as redundant as it seems, as while "charisma" as a word implies a passive strength of character, the stat actually means and is utilized more as a "social intelligence" statistic, more relevant to understanding others and perceiving their social cues than anything else. These are the two stats that generally cause the most overlap ambiguity about "which one should I roll in this situation", but it's generally clear enough to me as the GM that this isn't a real problem.<br/><br/>Presumably a combined WILL+CHARISMA would be called something like "Nature", and the same stat would be used for perceiving social cues, empathizing with human motivations, holding your ground against adversity, convincing and commanding others, and wielding magic. Feels good in my particular mechanical context, but we'll see if I ever get to make the change; players do seem to love the distinction between strength of will and social facility.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462667/#Comment_462667" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-29T23:40:34+00:00" title="April 29, 2017 11:40PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Presumably a combined WILL+CHARISMA would be called something like "Nature", and the same stat would be used for perceiving social cues, empathizing with human motivations, holding your ground against adversity, convincing and commanding others, and wielding magic.</blockquote>\nMaybe, PERSONALITY. And I like that it would remain the main "magic guy" attribute (I am, for some inexplicable reason, almost inordinately fond of having "Charisma" as a main wizardly stat, and not in the benign, almost afterthought-ish way of an d20 bard). It also looks like an almost complete overlap with Will in <i>Sorcerer</i>, at this point, doesn't it?<br/><br/>BTW, which attribute if any governs ranged attack rolls in your home D&amp;D, Eero?

Meaty abilities that are important and have multiple ways to map them into fictional meaning; I remember well how I first got into fiddling with the D&amp;D stats because I grew bored with the relatively cliched imagery associated with the physical stats in D&amp;D. By lumping them together I got rid of the strength-dexterity-constitution emphasis and freed characters to express their physicality more freely.<br/><br/>As you correctly infer, ranged attacks are not quite intuitive here. I have it under WITS by fiat, basically - I mean to say that unlike most issues, proficiency with missile weapons doesn't fall obviously and entirely under either statistic, but in the interest of not having to think about it I just tend to call it WITS. It sort of resonates with the narrative genre, people tend to assume that a bowman is sharp-eyed and keen-witted and so on.<br/><br/>The way I handle these straddling issues (there are others, but the missile weapons thing is by far the most prominent) is basically with various compromises that amount to "use both" in various ways just shy of calculating an average and using that. For example, a character may have the option of learning a specific martial style that flips some weapon usage from STAMINA to WITS or vice versa. Or, a character whose secondary stat is higher than their primary may get a +1 bonus doing the thing. Or perhaps a character can get some other benefit from the other stat.<br/><br/>For example, one conceit that we've been fiddling with is that perhaps a bow-user needs to switch to using STAMINA after the first few shots when they're in a situation that requires constant fire for more than a few repetitions. Things like that. Maybe I just need a new stat, but "Hand-Eye Coordination" is such a dull concept for a whole stat that I haven't gone that way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462670">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P" title="Stephen P"><img alt="Stephen P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/529/n6YUPMWXC0KWV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P">Stephen P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462670/#Comment_462670" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-30T03:35:24+00:00" title="April 30, 2017  3:35AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 30, 2017 3:39AM by Stephen P.">edited April 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My current OSR game has been successfully using Might, Agility, Acuity, and Charisma.

I would personally be bothered by how formalistic it is (that is, organic creative impulses and real factors from the fiction are more difficult to incorporate), but it is evident that a highly elegant, streamlined and unified system like this makes it easier to get a handle on a complex subject matter and stay on course in general.<br/><br/>One observation I have about the "what are you rolling for" question is that in my experience all characters tend to be rolling about the same things. This can very easily be an artefact of the fact that Ability checks are in a very prominent position in the main flavour of D&amp;D I've been playing over the recent years - when your system uses Ability checks, obviously all characters tend to be rolling the same checks, as they all have somewhat similar Ability scores and so on. Would be different if the game had a mechanical emphasis towards the differences between the classes, so that e.g. non-fighters couldn't make fighting checks and so on.<br/><br/>Examples of common checks that people are making all the time at our table:<br/>- Various spot checks are called for when characters might or might not notice something.<br/>- Knowledge checks when a character observes something, so as to know how much to tell.<br/>- Social checks for gauging NPCs (sort of like a spot check for social situations) or for social competence.<br/>- Initiative, attack and defense maneuvers of various types.<br/><br/>Those are all checks that everybody's doing all the time, no matter the character class. This is definitely not the only way to go about things, and I would actually be very interested in playing a D&amp;D where, as a matter of design, most character classes couldn't make e.g. observation-related checks, or social checks - or combat checks for that matter. It would be one of those D&amp;D flavours that emphasizes class roles, instead of de-emphasizing them as my homebrew tends to do (characters only gain class flavour in my system as they gain levels; 1st-levelers tend to be fundamentally similar when all's said and done, although my recent skill system has done things to alleviate that a little bit).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462681">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vgunn" title="vgunn"><img alt="vgunn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vgunn">vgunn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462681/#Comment_462681" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-30T16:25:44+00:00" title="April 30, 2017  4:25PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, I'm not a big fan of social checks.

The results of the check justify various imponderables that we wouldn't normally talk about in advance, such as non-verbal cues, unknown personality issues and so on, plus the GM is saved the trouble of making very complex choices about social reactions; it would be about as easy to decide whether a character hits with  sword in combat based on attack description as it would be to decide whether a NPC reacts favourably to an approach, I think.<br/><br/>The advantage here is that it doesn't feel so much like trying to kiss up to the GM to get what you want, and we get more of the social strategy/skill aspect of the game up on the table for overt consideration: the players get to see how easy or difficult it is, exactly, to threaten or bribe or cajole the amazons, and the player who chooses the right approach gets to feel smart about it. If you're feeling inspired, give an in-character spiel and it's worth a circumstance bonus to the check, too.<br/><br/>Plus, this allows quiet and socially clueless players to play smooth and charming adventurers by the virtue of their strong social stats, even if the player doesn't really understand the social nuances very well. Works for us.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462737">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vgunn" title="vgunn"><img alt="vgunn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vgunn">vgunn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462737/#Comment_462737" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-01T18:11:44+00:00" title="May  1, 2017  6:11PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for all the comments, its been very inspiring for me!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462738">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vgunn" title="vgunn"><img alt="vgunn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vgunn">vgunn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462738/#Comment_462738" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-01T18:20:34+00:00" title="May  1, 2017  6:20PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 1, 2017 6:40PM by vgunn.">edited May 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would like to see if you can some up with any stats that you can think of for these classes:<br/><br/>ALCHEMIST: <br/>ASSASSIN: CASE, CHARM, MURDER, POISON, SNEAK, SURVIVAL <br/>BARBARIAN:<br/>BARD: <br/>CLERIC:  BLESS, CHARM, CRUSADE, LORE, SURVIVAL, TURN <br/>DRUID:<br/>DWARF:<br/>ELF:<br/>HALFLING:<br/>PALADIN:<br/>RANGER:<br/>THIEF: CANT, CASE, CHARM, FIGHT, SNEAK, SURVIVAL<br/>WARRIOR:<br/>WIZARD:<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462744">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462744/#Comment_462744" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-01T18:55:45+00:00" title="May  1, 2017  6:55PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>Those are all checks that everybody's doing all the time, no matter the character class.

Or, we can start with a vision where the rules formalize when to roll dice and when not to (as with attack rolls or saves).<br/><br/>Further, we can look at D&amp;D as a game where your fictional decisions put you in a position of being able to do things, but we can fall back on the dice as your character's last resrot:<br/><br/>In this case, we get a careful style of play where if you're rolling the dice, you know you've made an error. <br/><br/>The purpose of the roleplaying, then, is to position your character so as to avoid rolling the dice (like when you try to disarm a trap - you're hoping you come up with a clever solution so that you don't have to make a saving throw).<br/><br/>However, another approach is to say that the purpose of the roleplay is to position yourself so as to be able to make a roll. (In this case, your exploration of the trap is an attempt to justify making a "Disarm Traps" roll, which is something you're good at - otherwise, you're at its mercy.)<br/><br/>In practice, most versions of D&amp;D I've seen mix these things in various ways, but a more "pure" version would be really interesting to try, I think.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462745">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462745/#Comment_462745" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-01T19:00:21+00:00" title="May  1, 2017  7:00PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems to me that pretty much all classes have SURVIVAL, it's sort of in-built in being human. Maybe Monks have something better instead.<br/><br/>Sage-type classes probably all have the following three:<br/><br/>UNDERSTANDING - interpret a thing's nature from observations, find its weaknesses, learn new things etc.<br/>LORE - know useful stuff<br/>OBSERVATION - notice things, perceive hidden things, etc.<br/><br/>(No CHARM, note - the sage-type doesn't do charm, they UNDERSTAND you and then offer you wise advice.)<br/><br/>Because Alchemist, Bard and Wizard are all "sage-types", they will therefore probably share those four stats of SURVIVAL, UNDERSTANDING, LORE, OBSERVATION. Perhaps drop one for semi-sages.<br/><br/>Alchemists obviously have PRECISION (focus and execute recipes) and INVENTIVENESS (create and adapt recipes), as those alongside LORE are the cornerstones of their craft, I would assume. I would also drop OBSERVATION for either WARPING (dark alchemy - mutations caused by long practice, think Jekyll/Hyde) or ENLIGHTENMENT (light alchemy - same as Monks get, except provided by e.g. Taoist and Euro-style historical spiritual alchemy practices), as alchemists don't need to be alert, and they can do about half of the observation stuff with PRECISION anyway (e.g. search for stuff).<br/><br/>Bards would have MUSIC and WANDERLORE (street smarts, geographic knowledge, languages, etc.) on top of the sage package, presumably. Perhaps drop UNDERSTANDING for FIGHT depending on how you see the concept.<br/><br/>Wizards would have the sage package, plus RITES (ritual magic, memorizing spells, etc.) and SHAPING (shaping wild magic, improvised magic, cantrips, counterspelling, controlling on-going magic, etc.).<br/><br/>Sorcerers/witches aren't really sages, but in comparison, they would have RITES and SHAPING like Wizards. They would also have e.g. BLOOD (replaces SURVIVAL, plus replaces LORE as a source of magical insight) or PACT (social stature with spirit forces that the magic comes from) and so on.<br/><br/>Druids would be like Clerics, except swap CRUSADE and TURN with WILDSHAPE (nature skills + shapeshifting) and ELEMENTALISM (elemental magic plus dimensional wackery etc. setting-depending). Rangers are like Fighters, except they also get WANDERLORE instead of WARCRAFT and some sort of super-SURVIVAL that covers nature skills as well.<br/><br/>Speaking of, Fighters presumably have the following:<br/><br/>FIGHT<br/>WARCRAFT<br/>SURVIVAL<br/>LEADERSHIP<br/><br/>plus something else.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462765">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vgunn" title="vgunn"><img alt="vgunn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vgunn">vgunn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462765/#Comment_462765" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-01T21:04:47+00:00" title="May  1, 2017  9:04PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wanderlore, I really like that word!<br/><br/>Bushcraft is a must for Ranger.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462766">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vgunn" title="vgunn"><img alt="vgunn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vgunn">vgunn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462766/#Comment_462766" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-01T21:06:05+00:00" title="May  1, 2017  9:06PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For the Fighter, I think you could wrap leadership into Warcraft and keep Charm.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462782">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462782/#Comment_462782" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-01T23:38:18+00:00" title="May  1, 2017 11:38PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You could, but you could also decide that perhaps their wartorn nature has made them a little, you know, limited about this whole human interaction thing. They'd presumably interact with Warcraft and Leadership when it comes to other tough guys, but what does the killer know of human niceness? CHARM isn't used for threatening others anyway, for that you'd use LEADERSHIP presumably. (Maybe stupid brutes call that ability MENACING instead, in fact...)<br/><br/>That is to say, in your stead I would consider the holes I leave in the ability array as much as the exceptional abilities I'd put in there. Aside from giving the classes interesting weaknesses, it also allows other classes to shine, making them more attractive and encouraging teamwork. Having "Charm" as one of your abilities feels a lot like a standard slot (it is a traditional D&amp;D ability, after all), but when some classes don't get it, you start to appreciate it much more. Those Thieves and Clerics and Bards are more interesting if CHARM is something exceptional to them.<br/><br/>That's why I singled out SURVIVAL earlier, that's one stat you'll probably want to give everybody (unless they have something to cover it, of course) due to how important the rolls made on it tend to be. I could see treating it as something special, too, in which case only Barbarians and Fighters and such would have it.<br/><br/>And yeah, BUSHCRAFT is the word I couldn't think of when typing the above. Covers much of SURVIVAL, plus more.<br/><br/>Regarding the non-human classes, they probably have ALIENESS as one of their stats, representing their elf/dwarf/halfling nature (social checks with their own kind, using their cultural tools, using their racial special powers, etc.). Aside from that they're probably pretty similar to their parent classes, so dwarves are like Fighters (maybe the "dwarviness" stat replaces LEADERSHIP or whatever social stat Fighters end up with), halflings like thieves or fighter/thieves of some sort, and elves are fighter/magicians.<br/><br/>The Elf array specifically might look like this:<br/><br/>ALIENESS (or ELFINESS, if you prefer)<br/>LORE<br/>SHAPING<br/>FIGHT<br/>SURVIVAL<br/>CHARM<br/><br/>The Elf doesn't need the RITES stat I suggested earlier for magic-users because their ALIENESS stat covers that - the elfier you are, the more spells you know and learn and so on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andye" title="Andye"><img alt="Andye" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andye">Andye</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462800/#Comment_462800" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-02T09:29:39+00:00" title="May  2, 2017  9:29AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is exciting!

Whereas a character with LEADERSHIP instead might be noble and inspiring in all their interactions, but how are they going to intimidate some thug in a back alley?<br/><br/>I think the more specific and flavourful the better for these skillstats. CRUSADE is strong for Clerics, but TURN is so rooted in D&amp;Disms that it's almost flavourless. I also like the idea of stats that can cover multiple bases (physical, mental, social, and arcane).<br/><br/>Like my Cleric would have PURGATION (driving out evil) and HEALING (bringing back wholeness). A Cleric could use PURGATION to turn undead and exorcise demons, but also to drive out sickness and infection, or rid a repentant sinner of their guilt. They could use HEALING to repair broken bones and knit together torn muscle, but also to heal a rift between two warring families, or best friends suffering a misunderstanding. CRUSADE could be used to war against the unholy, but also to stir the faithful to battle.<br/><br/><br/>Clerics: PURGATION, HEALING, CRUSADE, UNDERSTANDING, LORE, SURVIVAL<br/><br/>Rather than thinking about the mechanical role of a class, how about the social role of the archetype? I think by doing that you can capture both the adventure function and the human-interactive function with both greater specificity than trad D&amp;D stats, and broader reach than your more specific skillstats.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462801">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andye" title="Andye"><img alt="Andye" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andye">Andye</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462801/#Comment_462801" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-02T09:39:07+00:00" title="May  2, 2017  9:39AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, can comment on what you mean by the Fighter skill WARCRAFT?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462804">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462804/#Comment_462804" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-02T10:24:45+00:00" title="May  2, 2017 10:24AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just the fighter equivalent of intelligence and erudition - knowledge about logistics, tactics, strategy.

Skills and backgrounds, also it can include specfic, special talents for each class. A cleric turning undead, a paladin laying on hands, the rage of a barbarian and so on.<br/><br/>A thief will use different moves than a fighter. A barbarian has a different way of using charm versus a cleric. Lore works differently for a magic-user, giving them the ability to cast spells, while for a cavalier this could include some chivalry knowledge.<br/><br/>So non-specific actions using your class are: roll equal/under 11 + level bonus. So at 1st level roll 2-11 to succeed (1 is always failure). Difficulty could add to the bottom threshold. <br/><br/>When your character reaches the following level, your class score will increase.<br/><br/>LEVEL\tCLASS SCORE<br/>3\t\t     12<br/>5\t\t     13<br/>7\t\t     14<br/>9\t\t     15<br/>11\t\t     16<br/>13\t\t     17<br/>15\t\t     18<br/>17\t\t     19<br/>19\t\t     20<br/><br/>Now lets say you are a first level thief (11 score) with a MOVES score of 15 and you're trying to move silently. Instead of using your class score, you can use MOVES (roll 2-15 to succeed).<br/><br/>Anything not covered by class or ability, you'll need to roll a save.<br/><br/>I'm not sure about saves, not sure if I should go with three: AVOID, CONFRONT, SOLVE or perhaps just one: DANGER.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462878">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462878/#Comment_462878" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-03T19:25:15+00:00" title="May  3, 2017  7:25PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The obvious question: if you're a Thief with MOVES 15 and I'm a Fighter with MOVES 15, then which one of us is better at moving silently? How about tumbling? How about breaking down doors?<br/><br/>I suppose the ol' standby would work - when a character's class competence overlaps with something anybody can try, the classed guy gets to try twice. So e.g. a Thief gets to try both a class check and a MOVES check for sneaking, while the Fighter only gets the MOVES check. Vice versa for breaking down doors, if you'd consider that to be part of the Fighter's class curriculum. Simple and robust, been ever since Thief skills came into the picture [grin].<br/><br/>Not much else to add, you've currently got something that seems basically orthodox - what you describe is pretty much how D&amp;D usually goes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vgunn" title="vgunn"><img alt="vgunn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vgunn">vgunn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462882/#Comment_462882" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-03T20:06:40+00:00" title="May  3, 2017  8:06PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are a some of things to offset it. One, AC adds to the difficulty for sneaking and climbing. So that fighter will find it more difficult if wearing heavy armor. <br/><br/>Lets say a fighter with Moves of 15 and wearing chainmail (AC 5) is attempting it. Normal resolution is 2-15 (1 is always a failure). Add the armor however, then it goes to 7-15. <br/><br/>Since it is a signature move for the thief (AC 2, leather), they add +2. So the roll is 4-17. <br/><br/>Depending on the situation, the fighter may have to go with a DANGER (or AVOID) save instead of using MOVES. That save score will be lower than the ability.<br/><br/>For breaking down the door, the same thing can apply. A signature move (+2) for the Fighter. The roll would be 2-17. For the Thief the +2 goes at the bottom, making the roll 4-15. <br/><br/>Now let's say there are enemies behind the thief and the door must be broken down quickly to escape. That would call for a DANGER save and would become even more difficult. <br/><br/>Again, being a signature move for the Fighter, no danger save is required (though you could add difficulty at the bottom since it is time related).<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vgunn" title="vgunn"><img alt="vgunn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vgunn">vgunn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462887/#Comment_462887" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-03T21:27:36+00:00" title="May  3, 2017  9:27PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've decided to just call the saving throw SAVE <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> <br/><br/>Can't use your ability or class, roll SAVE.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462938">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462938/#Comment_462938" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-04T21:04:46+00:00" title="May  4, 2017  9:04PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            VGunn, your 6 abilities look much better already.

Adds are similar to skills, attributes, or traits. Whenever you can use an Add in a response, you\u2019ll have an advantage and will roll 2d20\u2013keeping the highest result. You can only use one Add per response.<br/><br/>Adds, and their use, are explained hereafter:<br/><br/>[sample list\u2014incomplete]<br/><br/>ADVISE\u2014interpret opinions through acute observation and understanding<br/>ALCHEMY\u2014study and use of various components and harmful substances<br/>BATTLE\u2014military knowledge and strategy<br/>CAMP\u2014<br/>CHARM\u2014allure, inspiration, and persuasion <br/>CHIVALRY\u2014code of values and military training<br/>CLOISTER\u2014religious study and knowledge <br/>COMMAND\u2014charm, inspire, intimidate, and lead<br/>DELVE\u2014underground abilities, such as mining and stonework<br/>EXERT\u2014<br/>EXPLORE\u2014<br/>FIRST AID<br/>GLAMOUR*(pick specific power)\u2014faerie illusional magic<br/>HIDE\u2014<br/>IMPROVISE\u2014<br/>LORE\u2014knowledge of particular fields and subjects<br/>MAGIC*(pick specific spell)\u2014ability to use spells<br/>MIRACLES*(pick specific gift)\u2014divine favors and powers<br/>NOTICE\u2014<br/>ORIENTEERING\u2014 <br/>PARLAY\u2014<br/>PREPARE\u2014<br/>PSIONIC*(pick specific power)\u2014psychic and paranormal powers<br/>PURLOIN\u2014<br/>RIDE\u2014<br/>RUCK\u2014<br/>SCOUT\u2014hunting, foraging, trapping, tracking<br/>SNEAK\u2014subterfuge abilities such as moving silently<br/>SURVIVAL\u2014 <br/>TROUPE*(pick specific method)\u2014thespian and musical expertise <br/>TURN\u2014ability to destroy unholy and undead<br/>WEAPON*(pick specific type)\u2014combat prowess and skill<br/>WORLDLY\u2014street smarts, geographic knowledge, languages, customs<br/><br/>Every character in the game has in common three Moves: Active, Reactive, and Creative. These scores range from 1 to 14, and are added to any d20 rolls you make. You\u2019ll begin play with 7 points and you may divide them amongst the three, with a maximum of 4 in any score. Active Moves are used for direct actions such as attacking an enemy. Reactive Moves are used for response actions such as avoiding a trap. Creative Moves are actions used to alter a situation, such as casting magic.<br/><br/>Grit measures your determination, morale, and staying power\u2014especially in battle. When your character takes damage in combat, or certain situations, you lose Grit. Each character starts out with 8 Grit points. However, you can buy anoher Add or increase weapon damage by reducing your Grit by 1 point. Magic spells and divine miracle each cost 1 Grit point per power level.  <br/><br/>SAMPLE CHARACTER<br/><br/>Ulli, the DWARF<br/><br/>Moves\u2014Active: 3  Reactive: 3 Creative: 1<br/>Adds\u2014Camp; Delve; [First Aid]; Exert; Ruck; Survival, Axe<br/><br/>Grit: 6 [1 point spent on extra weapon damage, 1 point spent on Add for First Aid]<br/><br/>Resistance: 9 [1 level + 5 + 3 Armor]<br/>Armor: Medium [+3 added to Resistance]<br/>Weapon: Axe [1d6+1]<br/><br/>CORE MECHANIC<br/><br/>Whenever you are in a situation and success is not automatic, you'll use one of your Moves and roll a d20. If the result is higher than your opponent or the Difficulty number, you have succeeded. If you can use one of your Adds, then roll 2d20 and keep the highest result. <br/><br/>There are mitigating factors, such as combat, where if both combatants have an advantage\u2014then they cancel out and they will roll one d20. The Referee will roll very little in the game, usually for Monsters in combat and for damage.<br/><br/>Difficulty numbers run from 5 for Easy tasks, topping out at 19 for Extreme tasks. Most often, penalties will be added to the Difficulty number. However, the Referee might decide that a task is particularly risky, or your character is at a disadvantage, and you\u2019ll need to roll 2d20, keeping the lowest result. On the other hand, some situations could allow for a 3d20 advantage/disadvantage roll\u2014or even be considered so simple that success is automatic. <br/><br/>No matter what the task and what modifiers may be applied, a roll of a natural 20 (ie, the d20 comes up with a \u201820\u2019) is always a success. Conversely, a roll of a natural 1 is always a failure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471829">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471829/#Comment_471829" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-13T08:41:25+00:00" title="April 13, 2018  8:41AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When playing in English I use the traditional names b/c nostalgia.<br/>But when I translated them I changed intelligence to knowledge, wisdom to awareness, and charisma to sense of self.

It was a sort of pre-OSR-OSR attempt with some pre-AW-AW stuff too (choosing from defined lists, mechanical relationship matrixes, learning moves from other classes (if you had a positive relationship)). Especially the class design was very creative.<br/><br/>The point was that adventuring was a shitty job where drugged up outcasts would raid abandoned hospitals for loot while being hunted by horrors spawned by the ambient decay. Smoke breaks were critical to not go crazy (each class had a different end state if their stress got too high, the Psychic's head would explode and cause a mile wide psychic shockwave). The corporation itself would level up but the management would impose new rules on the adventurers (some were more adept at bending the rules) that would usually make their life harder. "We're a gun free company!" "The assistant executive will be tagging along and grading your performance!"<br/><br/>The rules for combat and exploration were much too clunky in practice. I think the setting would be great as you could use basically any modern building layout as a dungeon, just add some obstacles and hazards and add a monster or two and you're good to go.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471903">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vgunn" title="vgunn"><img alt="vgunn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vgunn">vgunn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471903/#Comment_471903" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-13T23:30:54+00:00" title="April 13, 2018 11:30PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Krippler">@Krippler</a> This is definitely along the same lines for what I\u2019m working on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vgunn" title="vgunn"><img alt="vgunn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vgunn">vgunn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471908/#Comment_471908" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-14T00:29:17+00:00" title="April 14, 2018 12:29AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 14, 2018 6:17AM by vgunn.">edited April 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Still trying to decide on what to call Active, Reactive, Creative.
