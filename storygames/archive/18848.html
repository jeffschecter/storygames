Rowling book but it isn't. I opened this thread to discuss a bit about something that started <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/18836/procedures-to-create-adventures#Item_15" rel="nofollow">on this other thread</a>.<br/><br/>I just found out why (design-wise, not color-wise) there are games that some people will understand, run and enjoy better than others. See, you've probably heard before of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_multiple_intelligences" rel="nofollow">Theory of Multiple Intelligences</a>, but have you ever thought how deeply it impacts our hobby?<br/><br/>I've often had trouble playing 3.5 and PF because of the amount of rules and fiddling around with numbers I've gotta make there. I'm an artist, so I'm more visual/spatial oriented. Our gm feels at home with the system, since he's more logic/math oriented. On top of that, he works as an accountant and he's used to memorizing legal stuff and relate it to those numbers, so in the end he actually relaxes playing PF, while I get a bit stressed about that part of the game. <br/><br/>He can set a bunch of numbers on a spreadsheet and see a living town in there, where I only get a headache. But I can draw a map of that town and bring it alive in 3d, while rolling dice to come up with numbers just when needed. He can pull a combat without miniatures but you'll realize he's thinking verbally and not spatially, just using concepts like "flanking" or "behind you". I can pull a combat without miniatures (actually I prefer those) and track the action in the three axes of movement, visualizing the whole thing in my head like a movie. And the faster the action, the better.<br/><br/>No wonder why you can find so many different systems, mechanics and procedures, and think "it's a matter of taste" or "this game isn't for me" and start hacking away something other people can run as it is, or never get a game and hate it despite you love the genre used. Genre and Color is a matter of taste, while easily, only 30% of the issue is that you're used to other mechanics, and the other 70% of it is <i>because you think in a different way than the authors of the game.</i><br/><br/>I'm wondering what would happen if this concept were used widely enough, until you could find labels on the cover of RPG books with something along the lines of "suggested for visual-spatial thinkers"<br/><br/>Also, 9 types of intelligences and their combinations! You could find out easily what your kids most developed type of intelligence is and educate them properly to take better advantage of it. What do you think? And<i> how</i> are you thinking it?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422095">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scrape" title="Scrape"><img alt="Scrape" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/791/nYVCU4CTTPHBF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scrape">Scrape</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422095/#Comment_422095" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-27T10:52:39+00:00" title="September 27, 2013 10:52AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fascinating! I immediately thought of where certain games reward the intelligences in different ways. For instance, Inter- and Intrapersonal intelligences seem to clearly correlate to two methods of roleplaying: focusing on the group dynamic and focusing on your character's ambitions. These aren't mutually exclusive, of course, but I just never thought of them as separate <i>skills</i>, I always considered them just different <i>methods</i>.<br/><br/>The two verbal skills, Linguistic and Spatial, are both rewarded in this hobby but in different ways. The ability to parse, express, and manipulate language is key to navigating the fictional space. But according to this theory, it's a different skill than actually using that language to <i>visualize</i> the described location.<br/><br/>Seems like OD&amp;D rewards Spatial skills; the ability to visualize your environment "correctly" gives you greater advantage tactically. Whereas FATE reward Linguistic skill pretty bluntly, by relying on Aspect phrases to convey the same information and even handwaving distances and measurements into Zones. Thanks for sharing, this really made me think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422103/#Comment_422103" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-27T12:28:43+00:00" title="September 27, 2013 12:28PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This may hold true on a general statistical level, but I deeply doubt it can shed much light at an individual level.

Drifting away from Multiple Intelligences for a moment, there's at least one recent look at personality types and games using empirical psychological tests: Jason VandenBerghe's look at the correlation between <a href="http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1015364/The-5-Domains-of-Play" rel="nofollow">the Big 5/OCEAN personality model and video games</a>, specifically looking at player motivation. He also has a <a href="http://www.darklorde.com/2013/07/slides-gdc-2013-acting-like-players-applying-the-5-domains-of-play/" rel="nofollow">followup talk from his research this year</a>, covering how to apply that to design, among other things. (It's also easier to follow, so you might want to start with that one.)<br/><br/>His main categories are novelty, challenge, stimulation, and harmony, each of which corresponds to different personality types. There are further subcategories and so forth, but I'll let you read the presentation for yourself. Now, he's looking specifically at video games, which have slightly different design constraints. But I think the general ideas apply to story games, even if some aspects of it end up being different.<br/><br/>And as to the central question of the thread, I think personality types definitely relate to what kinds of games you'll enjoy playing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422115">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422115/#Comment_422115" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-27T14:09:35+00:00" title="September 27, 2013  2:09PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 27, 2013 2:12PM by WarriorMonk.">edited September 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why of course they correlate! We all adapt, so it's not like I can't do math or play a game heavy on numbers, it's just that it's easier to me to play a game that doesn't rely heavily on that. I used to be quite introvert but eventually I developed my social skills enough to GM with ease and more. Intelligences aren't static, but totally dynamic, and they overlap each other.<br/><br/>You can even use some to deal with some of the aspects that others usually cover. For example, a good part of my social skills are based on quick statistics calculations. I can't memorize numbers or formula easily, but I can use mnemonic tricks based on sound or images. I admit this kind of approach relies on the assumption that there are more people that developes one intelligence over the others, than people who develope all their intelligences at more or less the same level. Another assumption I'm making is that possible players aren't already burned by overusing a certain mechanic, which is possible, even if you're oriented to think in the way meant by the author of that mechanic. I'm an artist but even I tire out of drawing once in a while, and while I do draw comics on my spare time, I probably wouldn't do such if I had to work drawing 8 hours a day, five or days a week.<br/><br/>About how empiric is this, I wouldn't care too much, I mean, I've seen games with mechanics based on all sorts of empirical things. I'm okay with this giving me one more reason not to believe on a "holy grial" game of games able to unify all players under a single roleplaying model or mechanic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422116">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422116/#Comment_422116" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-27T14:26:37+00:00" title="September 27, 2013  2:26PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think explicitly calling out particular skills as being useful is a good thing for games.<br/><br/>Like, imagine a Quiet Year game posting and it says "basic knowledge of how to use a straightedge, compass and protractor will be needed; colored pencils and pastels will be provided".

As already mentioned, it's mostly bunkum.<br/><br/>People do have certain learning styles they're better at.  Some students are more likely to learn when information is spoken aloud, while other are more likely to learn when information is depicted in an illustration or diagram, and so forth.  But that's a secondary concern to the information being taught.  So someone studying geometry, even if their favored learning style is auditory, is more likely to learn a geometric concept from diagrams than from a spoken lecture.  Likewise, a student who learns best from pictures overall will still have an easier time learning vocabulary from a lesson that focuses on writing and speaking than they would from a lesson that sought to impart vocabulary pictorially.<br/><br/>What does this mean for gaming?  Mostly that it doesn't matter if certain mechanics are easier for people who are good with arithmetic while others are easier for people who are good with spacial visualization.  What matters is which rule best fits the thing you're trying to do.<br/><br/>That's most evident in games that use abstract positioning systems, such as the FFG versions of the Warhammer and Star Wars RPGs, and 13th age.  They use a system that's designed to make things simpler by taking out all the inch-by-inch movement systems that games such as D&amp;D use.  In practice, they're usually more complicated and clunky--because positioning is a fundamentally spatial concept, so using a spatial system (even one that on paper is more complicated) is a better fit than an system that relies on narrative description.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422160">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422160/#Comment_422160" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-29T07:41:39+00:00" title="September 29, 2013  7:41AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you're looking at one part of it.

Even if Multiple Intelligences specifically are sketchy, the idea behind them (that we all learn in different ways) seems pretty solid. And I can see that having an impact on what we like.<br/><br/>I'm pretty visual/emotional. I have to see something and get a kind of intuitive feel for it. Give me a formula and forget it - it just doesn't register. And the importance doesn't matter much, either. If you said "Josh, solve for X or the planet gets it!" then we would all be doomed. But give it a feeling, an emotion, and hell yeah, I'm there.<br/><br/>That has a big impact on the games I like. D&amp;D - not so much. 7th Sea? Love(d) it. That's why I'm on this forum. <br/><br/>Which brings me to this: we are playing rpgs because we like them. Learning something you like is VERY different from learning something you don't like. <a href="/forums/profile/Rickard">@Rickard</a>: I think that's what you mean by "investment."

That's what I get for typing past my bedtime.<br/><br/>What I was (am) getting at: I like what arscott said about the learning of content being tied to the presentation more than to our own learning style, but I think our style is pretty important because the way we learn influences what we like and if we like something we are more interested in learning it. Which, yeah, is kind of circular logic, but in my experience it is true.<br/><br/>Applying that to RPGs, I think the nature of the game being played (the story being told, the way it is told, and the group dynamic) has more to do with what attracts people to the game rather than the particular set of rules being used. That's where the match to learning styles has the biggest influence.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422186">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422186/#Comment_422186" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-30T05:35:56+00:00" title="September 30, 2013  5:35AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm using lizard brain nonsense in my current Trail of Cthulhu game, linked to the Theosophist theories of precursor races.

Now instead of working on my education homework, I'm considering how to run a Cthulhu game linked to the theory of multiple intelligences.<br/><br/>What if human beings were nothing more than empty puppets--and our minds are just psychic projections of trans-spatial entities into the physical world.  Each of the intelligences represents the projection of a separate entity, and our minds as we understand them are a gestalt.<br/><br/>What if the Mi-go harvest parts of the brain for their brain canisters corresponding to various intelligences.  Perhaps they pull most bits out but leave the kinesthetic one in--so they get a brain in a jar and a functioning zombie.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422208">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422208/#Comment_422208" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-30T12:23:55+00:00" title="September 30, 2013 12:23PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 30, 2013 12:45PM by WarriorMonk.">edited September 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But you haven't considered making games for people who are into music, there are not enough for people who are more visual, nor making more mixes in order to have new innovative games that could appear to different audiences?<br/><br/>Even if you aren't doing that, don't you think by reading the theory that game design so far has actualy not been enough inclusive, and that may have something to do with the slow spred of the hobby?<br/><br/>Even if we agree that the TMI is nonsense, why can't we inspire on it to produce something different? It's not like we're trying to prove it's right or convince anybody into believing it. Think of it more like using Phrenology as inspiration for a game. Heck, lately I wasn't even planning to mention the so-called theory on the rulebook at all. I was thinking now on something more like the designer writing a pharagraph about how he/she thinks like, so you could make more sense out of the book, rules and principles. I mean, I didn't understood old school until I readed a couple anecdotes about how Gary Gygax runned his games.<br/><br/>Now tell me, how many times had you wanted to be in the head of an RPG designer to understand what he/she meant with this obscure rule or this weird mechanic you can't make work in your game? Be either the TMI, tarot, voodoo, or whatever model you would like to use to approximate to this task, wouldn't be worth the shot if you get closer to it?<br/><br/>And, come on, I do accept "pseudoscience" and any opinions about it, but calling it "bunkum" is totally disrespectful.

Some people were expressing doubt in emotional intelligences and I was simply saying that WarriorMonk's point about learning styles influencing the games we play still carries weight, even if you don't put stock in emotional intelligence.<br/><br/>And he makes another good point with the example of games geared for people into music. How many people have spent a lot of time on a "soundtrack" for their games? I bet I'm not the only person to run part of a game session by having my players close their eyes and listen to a narrative with a few choice songs in the background. And also, how many times have we gotten up from the gaming table so we can illustrate what our characters are doing with our own bodies? <br/><br/>Are there any table-top RPGs that use non-verbal sound and motion as part of the mechanic? I'm picturing that scene of the concert from Mr. Holland's Opus with the flashing colored lights so that deaf people could still experience the music ... it would be interesting to see how different approaches could be used to give a broader means of engaging and enjoying the game without getting too convoluted to play.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422273/#Comment_422273" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-01T17:50:52+00:00" title="October  1, 2013  5:50PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 1, 2013 5:57PM by Graham.">edited October 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From my understanding, there isn't a great evidence base behind learning styles, either.

It worked nicely, though it kept me busy looking for the specific track each time we played. For the next campaign I prepared an even longer playlist, but then something funny happened when I burned it on a cd: all the songs went in a mixed order that didn't correspond to my list anymore. We were already playing when I noticed, so it was too late for me to do anything. I choosed to just kept the music playing as a background while we play. Surprisingly now the appropiate music for the scene pops up at the right time. Either our cd player is bewitched or we're subconciously influenced by the music to give the proper dramatic turn to the scene at the right time. I've heard somewhere around here of a game based on this concept, either that was Ribbon Drive or another one?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
