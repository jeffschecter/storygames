I'm not sure if I've posted here before... I've lurked for a while, but haven't ever really jumped in. I'm doing game chef this year and I guess that's made my forum love meter go up. <br/><br/>Anyways, game chef got me to thinking about what I really love about games now, especially because of the design notes section that rpgtheoryreview.blogspot.com encouraged folks to include. So I keep coming back to this thought about mythology and ceremony that I want to hear y'all's thoughts on. (The thoughts from this are mostly mixed up from playing Polaris and Roach, reading some Joseph Campbell a while ago and <a href="http://clehrich.livejournal.com/6070.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> response to the infamous "brain damage" thread when RPG theory review posted it just a little while ago.)<br/><br/>When I originally got into indie games (that is, when I actually started playing them, which was a good year after I visited the forge, got halfway through the essay on Narrativism, and declared it all pretentious bullshit that I'd never engage) I thought that I had a solid idea of what Narrativism was supposed to do. Though I'd never have worded it this way at the time, it seemed like a good Nar session would work like a good movie. It'd be a couple hours long, there would be significant turning points at thirty and then again at ninety minutes. At sixty minutes there'd be some deep crisis and at the end it'd all tie up nicely.<br/><br/>Looking back on it, it seems strange to conceptualize things that way. Like television, theatre or comics, there's an aesthetic that's particular to the technology of roleplaying which will produce a story whose virtues are wholly different from film, or any other story-bearing medium.<br/><br/>So, after a couple years of playing indie games, I think I've got a decent grasp on what one of those aesthetic principles. It lies somewhere between mythology and reincorporation. I'm not sure if there's some jargon word already out there for it, but for the sake of this post I'll call it Myth. And what I want to figure out in this thread is what exactly makes something Mythic. I can describe the sensation of interacting with Mythic things in gaming, but I can't really define what it is. Here's the description:<br/><br/>+ It is something that is repeated with variations from game to game. Like a theme in a classical symphony. You see it expanded, contracted, juxtaposed against a wide variety of objects. You also see it reinterpreted in different sessions, like Shakespeare texts are reinterpreted in different performances. There's something lasting and eternal about it.<br/><br/>+ It forms a sort of underpinning for the game. It ties all of the different sessions together in a way that hits me stronger than rules do. Intuitively, if the Myth is changed from game to game I feel like the game changes, while if the rules change from game to game I can feel like it's the same game. (For example, I might interact with completely different rulesets in two games of Burning Wheel, but still feel that the game is the same, while if I play a game of Deadlands with the Basic Roleplaying System, and then play a Basic Roleplaying-powered cyberpunk game, I'd feel that it was a completely different game.)<br/><br/>+ It feels a little mystical. I think that's because getting at something from a lot of different angles makes the central object feel essentially unknowable. Like in Mountain Witch- the Witch changes from time to time, but it all feels like dimensionality of a single Mountain Witch. The dimensionality just makes him more mysterious in the end.<br/><br/>What do you all think? I'm really still kinda green in the whole jargon dept., so feel free to pwn me if I was way off or am just rehashing old stuff.<br/><br/>-Nick<br/><br/>p.s.
