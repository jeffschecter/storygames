How does it play? How long does it take? Is it fun?<br/><br/>I was following the development of <a href="http://www.museoffire.com/Games/MiseryBubblegum/" rel="nofollow">Misery Bubblegum</a>, Tony LB's "story-telling card game of teen love and heartbreak" when he was first designing it. But I lost track of it over the last couple of years, and I have no idea what it's become.<br/><br/>Your opinion?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_348644">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348644/#Comment_348644" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-11T01:00:23+00:00" title="November 11, 2011  1:00AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's a great game, as long as you get the proper rules (on the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/codex/index.php?title=Misery_Bubblegum_-_Provisional_Second_Rules_Draft" rel="nofollow">S-G wiki</a>). It takes about 2 -3 hours to play. There's an initial set-up phase in which you create characters using cards and a relationship network around your dream (who you fancy and who's standing in your way). It's pretty quick, 15 minutes tops. Then players call for scenes, the GM facilitates NPCs and chivvies things along. I like the way it draws out conflict but doesn't immediately resolve it. It's quite soap-opera in that there's quite a lot of dissimulation between characters but it can lead to some very sweet scenes (Sweet being Tony's favourite word).<br/><br/>I've played it 5 times. Once it was OK, twice good, twice excellent. Now you're reminded me of it, I might run it again tomorrow at Indie RPG Meet-up (in London).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_348648">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348648/#Comment_348648" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-11T02:28:07+00:00" title="November 11, 2011  2:28AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It requires a bit more buy-in than your average roleplaying game - that is, the players need to grog the genre and want to do it, as the GM's role is so peripheral that it's difficult for him to support you to the usual degree.<br/><br/>Aside from that and the incomprehensible rulebook it's a great game, I somehow like how patronizing it is towards teenagers; fits us old guys better as a viewpoint to be nostalgic and amused about teenager foolishness, rather than identifying with culture made directly for teenagers as is so often the case. Gives the game a sweet undertone that is often present in Japanese teen drama (really made for adults nostalgic for their youth), but that is rather rare in the west (where drama will only have teen protagonists if it's intended for teen viewers).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_348714">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348714/#Comment_348714" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-11T13:56:16+00:00" title="November 11, 2011  1:56PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 11, 2011 1:57PM by Steve_Hickey.">edited November 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for that - especially the link.<br/><br/>So does scene framing in the game work something like this:<br/><br/>- the GM has a few specific scenes listed on her phase card that she tries to make happen (Steve, is this what you mean by chivvying things along)<br/>- the players initiate all other scenes (either by pursuing what they want or by triggering a special effect on one of their cards)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_348721">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348721/#Comment_348721" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-11T14:57:23+00:00" title="November 11, 2011  2:57PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure anybody really knows.

To me, the Phase card is just this, really not a scene card (as in "dramatic" phase). So if a scene follows directly the previous one, answers to the same need and/or keeps the same mood and theme, it's the same Phase. It's a progress on a dramatic pattern, and the scenes are tools to this, not masters. It's non-linear, but somewhat coherent : the GM's job is to make it so by following the previous scenes with appropriate Phase card.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
