I've got the core and a lot of bits, but it can be assembled two different ways, both of which have pluses and minuses.<br/><br/><b>The overall concept:</b><br/>Disposable Heroes is a tabletop RPG about managing a stable of fantasy adventurers. The fatality rate is rather high, so play consists of cycling through green recruits, sending them off on adventure, and managing the equipment and training of those skilled and lucky enough to survive. Over time, the players' stable of adventurers grows and improves despite the high turnover. They complete missions, earning experience and loot for their heroes, as well as progress toward the overall grand campaign goal. When they eventually have progressed enough, and have a team that seems to stand a decent chance, they take their shot at the final quest to see how it turns out.<br/><br/>When a party goes out on a mission, the players adopt the roles of the adventurers, each player making decisions for his one chosen hero. Since new recruits only survive a mission a little more than half the time, the players can stock the party with backup adventurers for players to switch over to when their first persona dies off. After the mission, any survivors come back, train and equip up, and the players interview (roll up) some new recruits for the next outing.<br/><br/><b>The big decision: GM Role</b><br/>#1: There is no GM. A mission outline is generated by rolling on tables. Once the mission is underway, the players roll on tables for each encounter to see what the details are, and then try to resolve the encounter. The opposition behavior (how they respond to diplomacy, which player they attack) is determined by rolling on tables.<br/><br/>#2: There is a GM, and the role can be switched off among players between missions. The GM's job is to roll on oracular tables pre-mission, and then construct a mission with that information as a seed. The GM decides how to spend her "points" on buying encounters and opposition, and plays adversary to the players during the mission.<br/><br/><b>How you can help:</b><br/>On a scale from 1-10, where 10 is "Hell yes, I would play that, sign me up for playtesting now!" and 6 is "Yeah, maybe. If I hear some good stuff about how it plays" and 1 is "You are killing gaming," how would you rate your interest in version <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> and version <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> of this concept?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_272248">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso" title="MikeRiverso"><img alt="MikeRiverso" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/825/n647RY8THQBOA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso">MikeRiverso</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272248/#Comment_272248" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-20T16:38:46+00:00" title="May 20, 2010  4:38PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 20, 2010 4:44PM by MikeRiverso.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why not do both?
