Players get taught by their gaming experience that the GM is <i>massively</i> more responsive to concrete skill activation than he is to any other kinds of input you might offer at the game table. This is particularly so for the latter-age universal-resolution trad games with long skill lists and hardly any other mechanical buttons. (BRP and the like, I imagine you know what I mean.)<br/><br/>Even in a completely GM-controlled railroad game this phenomenon persists in player perspective: a non-mechanical input gains you a brief nod from the GM, while hitting one of the magic phrasings that indicate skill activation gains full mechanical attention, such as it is: the GM stops what they're doing, declares the appropriate skill check procedure, asks you to roll the dice, lets you roll, looks at the result and pronounces judgement on your action with a brief description of what happens in the fiction as the result of what you did. That's much more interaction and "game-play" than what you get by saying stuff that doesn't trigger a skill check. They may even feel pressured to change the plot course due to the moral impact of your good dice roll, which is something that simply can never happen if you're not pressing mechanical buttons.<br/><br/>The negative reinforcement might be even more important in training players out of creativity: if you do something that both demands an answer and is <i>not</i> a skill check, what are the chances that this results in a positive interaction rather than a debate or judgement against your initiative? Not very good at all if you're at a traditional table. The GM is implicitly unwelcoming of creative initiative, as that endangers their prepped plot - naturally any creativity players express will be targeted towards escaping the plot, that's just how character-player agency works. In my experience a trad GM ends up damping down on initiative much more than encouraging it, simply because so few of the creative inputs the other players bring "fit" into their scheme. When I'm being a player in one of these games, I'm constantly faced by a mild disapproval for nearly every type of thing I may say; the GMs tolerate it because they can't muster the authority to tell the players to shut up, but it's clear that they would prefer us to color inside the lines instead of being creative.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473051">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473051/#Comment_473051" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-01T08:38:36+00:00" title="May  1, 2018  8:38AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 1, 2018 8:41AM by 2097.">edited May 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great post, Eero!<br/>So maybe the skill games like RQ and GURPS did even more harm than Dragonlance? <small>jag styrs utav draaakar... drakar och demoner <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/></small> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473052/#Comment_473052" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-01T08:58:03+00:00" title="May  1, 2018  8:58AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, harm... I guess so, from a certain perspective. But that's cultural history, isn't it? People try to shape the things they do to the perceived desirable ends, and they don't know in advance how it's going to end. If I was gaming in 1981, I certainly couldn't have predicted that neither universal skill systems nor Dragonlance style adventure paths would lead to the gaming nirvana that elevates player skill to unforeseen heights and enables equal artistic relations between GMs and players. I believe that the people at the time expected that this <i>would</i> be the road to follow, they didn't wish to get stuck in this pothole of eternal infantilization where players only grow more passive as the GMs ramp up the literary ambition of their game prep. I know I certainly didn't when I was trained into this tradition during the '90s - we were trying to game in an egalitarian and literarily sophisticated way, in hindsight it just happens to be the case that these techniques were not the way to get there.<br/><br/>It's harm in the same way that corsetry was and is harmful to humans: there are clear critical perspectives, but there is also much good reason to understand and empathize with people who supported corset culture in its heyday, or choose to wear corsets today. Cultural history in action.<br/><br/>But yeah, I definitely agree that universal skill resolution did much to establish the "streamlined" system chassis that would later become the go-to solution for any GM who truly preferred to be in control. A game with simpler mechanical touch-points and more isolated task resolution is much closer to the ideal monadic existence than something messy like old D&amp;D, with all sorts of inconvenient accountabilities between the dice and the outcomes. I don't think that <i>Fudge</i>, for example, has more than one rule that incontrovertibly demands a specific thing of the fiction in response to the dice. Nothing like e.g. the monster reaction roll in D&amp;D, which simply cannot be circumvented without hiding the roll or dropping the rule.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473053">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473053/#Comment_473053" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-01T09:14:37+00:00" title="May  1, 2018  9:14AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're right in that Q-factor vs monadism is more relevant there than the concept of "skills".

The problem happens when as a player that's my only input, as I fail to properly describe what I am doing in full detail.<br/><br/>AW's "to do something do it" and reccomendations for the GM to handle the moves and never let the players address the system seem somewhat solid to me, though I still have problems with ad-hoc moves which are usually handled by the players.<br/><br/>Would a system using only Aspect-like tags, but without numbers or specific mechanics associated to them could do the trick then? I mean, by having players describe how they use them the GM could adjust the difficulty of the roll. Clear guidelines to determine that would be the only problem then. <br/><br/>I tried setting those guidelines in a simple fashion as "everything that you have that you can cram into the action reduces the difficulty by 2" but what I usually get from it are players just doing that with a careless description. Also, tags look good on paper but suck at the table, as players start thinking too much on how to phrase their input and cram tons of tags on it, instead of actually think about what they are doing.<br/><br/>Player's input "quality" may be judged by a vote from their peers, though then it would mean they may get to railroad the game as a group.

Suggested both as a kind of corrective measure against overuse but also as the theoretical basis of a system. Could create an interesting sort of IIEE action economy, kind of flipping around the "only call for a roll when failure would have interesting consequences" GM maxim, placing the onus on the players to WANT to "just do it" most of the time and save their expendables for when things matter, and allowing them to push a roll with bonuses as a way of focusing on what's important to them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473059">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473059/#Comment_473059" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-01T14:46:32+00:00" title="May  1, 2018  2:46PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had a player ask me, "Can I get some kind of survival or search roll?"

Always ask the players to describe me what they are doing, interrupting them whenever they want to skip to the roll. Even if they are already sure about what they want to roll -like an attack- I'll keep asking them how they do it and give the obvious suggestions, and then describe the results using their roll and their input.<br/><br/>Yukamichi, that sounds like a good way to do it. Still thinking about how to do it for my particular design though. Maybe using a small d6 pool as stamina for each turn and then let players add one die for each skill/equipment/etc they want to invest in the action? Somehow keeping track of which skill has been used and which hasn't sounds like a bit too much bookeeping for my tastes.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473073">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473073/#Comment_473073" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-01T18:53:59+00:00" title="May  1, 2018  6:53PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Airk" rel="nofollow">Airk</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I'm not sure I follow what the mechanization is there Adam, can you elaborate?</p></div></blockquote>\nOh, probably a checkbox next to the skill.

But in such a situation, you could flip (or turn sideways in some non-patent-infringing way) cards to show they'd been used and then refresh them later, for example.<br/><br/>I also recently picked up a game called <b>30 Minute Heroes</b> where characters get a handful of "tag"-based abilities and can use each one exactly once per game (per the title, a session is meant to last about half an hour); just mark it off on your sheet once you use it. I suppose if you have relatively strong scene framing, you could extrapolate that out to a per-scene checklist next to the skill list without too much trouble, and would make for an interesting overview of what skills you used at the end of a session, especially if you're into the whole "use it to improve it" school of leveling up.<br/><br/>(Not really suggesting you think about using these ideas for your design btw, just musing out loud about ideas I've had for my own designs that vaguely address the topic)<br/><br/>Of course, thinking about it now, this is less about inhibiting button-pushing than it is about designing in a way that makes button-pushing not-bad, which might be the opposite of what people want. Guess I just think it's easier to try to channel people's regressive impulses into something more productive rather than to waste time trying to "correct" them <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473078">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473078/#Comment_473078" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-01T19:28:01+00:00" title="May  1, 2018  7:28PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 2, 2018 2:54AM by 2097.">edited May 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" rel="nofollow">Adam_Dray</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>If I were to mechanize skill buttons to encourage fiction-first play (watch me knit different threads together here, ha!), I would say that each skill must be \u201ccharged up\u201d before using it.

Basically, skills and items in my design will give no bonuses for the roll, they will just enable the character to do those things. <br/><br/>Except if these have a condition that must be fullfiled in order to use them. Then, depending on the condition, these will give from 1 to 3 bonus dice. The player rolls them all and keep the best. Of course, the more skills they want to use at the same time, the higher the difficulty, but they can still pile up some together to get all the bonus dice they want.<br/><br/>It creates different interesting side effects: There's the Gamble, as players wil try to balance the risk of facing a higher difficulty against getting a bit more sure about the result, though still without getting a deterministic one. Things can be slowed down to action resolution or accelerated to cover the player's intention, since a few more things can be accomplished through a single roll if the player wants to risk it. Players will get a bonus by roleplaying around their character limitations. The more they do this, the more bonus dice they get after all. I get to keep the feeling of mixing several items and skills that I was going for in this design without breaking the game.<br/><br/>And of course, players will have to argument/explain/describe more about their choices and actions to make the whole deal make sense, or risk giving the GM ground to make a move against them. Everything becomes a bit more RP and at the same time, everyone wins with it. Still have to see it at the table to find out what else is needed and what gets lost though. Hope it works as planned though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473127">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473127/#Comment_473127" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-02T16:03:00+00:00" title="May  2, 2018  4:03PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds cool, WarriorMonk!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473138">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473138/#Comment_473138" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-02T18:21:04+00:00" title="May  2, 2018  6:21PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks.

Excellent idea. Checking the desk drawers lets you find evidence if it's there. What if evidence is in the mattress? Now the skill roll comes into play. Roll Investigate. "You don't find any evidence in the desk drawers, but when you're done, you're pacing around the room wondering where this evidence might be. You're sure this guy's dirty. It has to be somewhere.

Don't let them. One side has their skill ratings on it. The other side has their character. The who and what and why that makes the character who he is. Aspects, keywords, traits, whatever-you-haves. A little spot for character portrait. Unless the GM asks for a roll, you may not turn your character sheet over. It's in the rules, right here.

Got an example?</div></blockquote>\nMy pal wanted a "sneak attack" skill, which for me would usually meant that 1)you either roleplay or position to gain surprise or rolled some skill (stealth, feint, etc) and then make an attack which had some extra punch. Here we could have a sneak attack skill with the condition "gain surprise" needed to earn the bonus die. Player can mix it with his stealth skill, which wouldn't yield bonuses unless it had a condition on itself. Like "only when invisibility spell is activated". The player has to focus on two things, which rises the difficulty of the roll; but if he roleplays in order to fulfill this condition too, he can get another bonus die.<br/><br/>However what we get in the end is a PC doing some things in preparation for that roll that could get him in trouble... if the roll fails. Then it would be easier to narrate "somebody spotted you when you tried to do magic and yelled "Kill the mage first!", as the player has established all these risks in the fiction himself. <br/><br/>We went through the magic system easily with this too. We listed several types of magic and came up with 5 or 6 conditions needed to power up the magic. It doesn't mean you need to take them but if you take a few (we put a cap of 3 condicions) you get that amount of bonus dice to the roll. The conditions were simply Somatic Casting, Vocal and Material. We added "weak against opposite magic" for elemental and necromantic vs divine, and "weak when machines are present". Can't remember the other one right now, but you get the idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473173">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi" title="yukamichi"><img alt="yukamichi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/677/nHW6876KEN77F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi">yukamichi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473173/#Comment_473173" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-03T01:04:57+00:00" title="May  3, 2018  1:04AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/DannyK" rel="nofollow">DannyK</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>When it comes to finding stuff, I have been really enjoying running a Gumshoe game.

NWPs were more like "flags" or "triggers" in the video game sense rather than something that we rolled. I was rather fond of it, in retrospect, especially compared to the overly granular catastrophe of many other games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473176">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" title="ValyrianSteelKatana"><img alt="ValyrianSteelKatana" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473176/#Comment_473176" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-03T04:18:51+00:00" title="May  3, 2018  4:18AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Please don\u2019t get hung up on the specifics of the scenario I laid out.

It also depends on if you want skills to grant narrative authority. Can the Investigate skill create evidence of corruption <i>ex nihilo</i>? How far does this authority extend? Alternatively: how much does the GM have to prep? Does he have to note whether every guard is asleep, alert, or awake-but-inattentive? And what factors does the die roll represent? Does a high roll on an Investigate check indicate that the sheriff left incriminating evidence in plain sight because he was called on an emergency, or does it indicate that the PC is a sleuth and knew where the sheriff would hide the evidence, or does it indicate a bout of dumb luck? In the same way that hit points abstract divine favor, luck, skill, fatigue, and meat into one value, the die roll could do the same.

But in the worst case, players could get to meet the conditions by... well, rolling another skill. I'd take it like they are taking more time and being more cautious. It could be better to avoid this worst case scenario though, by giving the player some choices instead:<br/><br/>-the PC wastes time doing it, so the focus moves to the next player until the conditions are met (the next turn or earlier if she gets help from another PC).<br/>-the PC needs to waste a resource other than time (mana, ki, money, etc) by marking it on his sheet<br/>-Improvise another move-like option like a hard bargain or ugly choice.<br/><br/>Some players will still love to just roll the dice, so I've got no prob allowing that after they give it a try to description and positioning. I kinda like how all this is nothing new, totally familiar for the players, except that things are in different places and played in different order, with a simple question in the middle: "How do you do that?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473704">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473704/#Comment_473704" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-10T14:28:45+00:00" title="May 10, 2018  2:28PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting discussion here. <br/><br/>I'm more or less with David and Eero on this topic:<br/><br/>Players need a sense that doing clever fictional things is effective and rewarded, and making abilities both reliable and fictionally relevant is a great way to do that.<br/><br/>"Roll Stealth to go unseen" is likely to lead to "button pushing" play. "You can disappear from any distracted person's immediate awareness by taking the shape of a nearby shadow" is often better, because it gets us talking about whether an NPC is distracted and describing the surrounding environment. The player knows to expect a reliable outcome, so they have strong incentive to follow through on those things - you end up with a more interesting dialogue between the player and GM.<br/><br/>As Eero says, the key is largely in how the group reacts to various inputs, as that conditions players to act on a certain way over time.<br/><br/>I see (even in this thread) lots of discussion of techniques to "trick" the players into "playing right", but, like Eero (if I'm reading him correctly), I think the group dynamics are really at the root here; players generally *want* to play, and if they're not, there's probably a good reason.<br/><br/>You can see this in effect instantly with a generous GM and an unforgiving ruleset (like old-school D&amp;D, for example). It doesn't take long to learn that, say, going to the dice gives you a 1 in 6 chance (and no way to improve that), but trying some more inventive approach gets you results and accolades.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473717/#Comment_473717" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-10T15:50:23+00:00" title="May 10, 2018  3:50PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Stealth is one of the few rolls I do use \u2014 in order to emulate things from B/X or 1e like "surprise".

In other words, you CANNOT hide without succeeding at the roll - the odds of success are your maximum odds of success.<br/><br/><i>"Ok, that's a good hiding place, but you have to roll to make sure you can pull it off."</i><br/><br/>In another school, if your fictional positioning is strong, we follow that. If it's unclear or uncertain, then the player gets the roll anyway, kind of like a saving throw. In this view, assuming the action is plausible at all, your odds of success are your minimum odds of success.<br/><br/><i>"Ok, that's not a very good hiding place, so you have to roll to see if you manage somehow, despite the difficulties."</i><br/><br/>Those make for two very different games. Given how brutal odds are in B/X, I've seen a lot of people go with the latter interpretation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473752">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473752/#Comment_473752" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-10T21:37:05+00:00" title="May 10, 2018  9:37PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love the idea of "saving throw".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473776">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473776/#Comment_473776" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-11T06:53:29+00:00" title="May 11, 2018  6:53AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" rel="nofollow">WarriorMonk</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I discussed this with another designer and ended up with something interesting, though still needs testing.
