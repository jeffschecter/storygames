Apologies), and having a blast with it. Although play-by-post (pbp) makes negotiation and helping dice more difficult, it turns out to lend itself really well to player narration, which is the heart of the game. <br/><br/>We started with Lady B, Naomi, Cyrus and Snargle in the brig, with their gear piled on a table near the door (Kale's player had dropped out), with some bored guards watching them. Quick enough to trick the guards into coming closer, allowing Cyrus to teleport over to the gear and pick up...<br/><br/>--and I couldn't see, but can imagine, the look on the player's face when he asked "What weapons do I find?" and I replied "What weapons do <i>you </i>think Cyrus would have been carrying?"--<br/><br/>...matched dueling blasters with a special silencing attachment! So he shot the guards full of holes and let everyone out. <br/><br/>Plan A, to put on the guard uniforms, was scotched by all the bulletholes and blood. The PCs reasoned, however, that more guards would eventually show up, so they hid the bodies and waited for more uniforms to come. This next time, Naomi went all River Tam on the guard's asses, leaving the others with not much to do except applaud and her to hit both her keys at once. The officer recognized Lady Blackbird and got shot for his troubles.<br/><br/>So, on to the landing bay...to be reported next time..<br/><br/>Observations:<br/>The simplest way to count the dice is to have the players use the actual adjectives (italicized for the tired GM) in complete sentences. This also helps the players write their posts, as half of their text is predetermined. <br/><br/>No matter what the difficulty, be prepared for a player to spend all their pool dice and succeed at the damned roll. I quickly learned to break the larger scenes into 2-3 objectives or else one player would get to do everything.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236321">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachlan" title="lachlan"><img alt="lachlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachlan">lachlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236321/#Comment_236321" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-08T08:44:31+00:00" title="October  8, 2009  8:44AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The landing bay fight, complicated by lack of a shared map (I finally wound up saying, "Okay, the Owl is on the pitcher's mound, the landing bay doors are home plate, you're at first base, the robots are at third...."etc etc) had lots of cool explosions, mostly caused by Snargle stealing an ornithopter and strafing the landing bay from <i>inside </i>the landing bay.<br/><br/>Much of the fun came from having lots of obstacles, instead of one super-large obstacle:  There were ship's troops, big engineer clockwork robots (with buzz-saw arms!), two ornithopters that could clearly be used to pursue the owl after it escaped, locked landing bay doors, and (Cyrus remembers) anti-aircraft guns on the hull of the <i>Hand of Sorrow.</i>  Plus Cyrus really wanted to taunt an Imperial Officer and Naomi was torn between killing everything and protecting Lady Blackbird. <br/><br/>They escaped (and Lady B's sorcery made sure the Hand was too crippled to pursue them), and are now landing at Nightport. <br/><br/>Highlights: Snargle's trousers (he went skinny to get through some bars, then had to pull the trousers through and put them back on); Cyrus's loofah (doesn't every pirate have a loofah? How do they exfoliate, then?); Lady Blackbird's fingernail-grip on her own sorcery; Naomi's general psychotic rages; and why Kale wasn't in the brig (he'd fallen asleep inside a steampipe and been overlooked).

Arkham visits the Brass Spider, where he makes contact with a smuggler, Naomi beats up a street thug at random (I'm sure she has a good reason, I'm waiting out find out what it is), Cyrus goes for dinner and Snargle for a flea bath. We lost our Lady Blackbird player and picked up a new one who is far more active and aggressive.

We've lost Naomi's player permanently, so Naomi wandered off into Nightport to 'find herself'. <br/><br/>Lady Blackbird, now going by "Natasha, just Natasha", had some high-quality snuggle time with Flint before he got kidnapped, replaced with an exact duplicate, and the duplicate died of a heart attack. Meanwhile, Cyrus and Kale did the ninja thing, locating Flint's secret plan and crossing an open space by zipline in perfect secrecy before setting off a burgler alarm. They ran downstairs to their target anyway, where they discover the real Flint, handcuffed to a steampipe. <br/><br/>To do list: <br/>1) foil Flint's plan<br/>2) rescue Flint <br/>3) beat the tar out of him for his plans<br/>4) get him to help the PCs foil the <i>Imperial </i>plan<br/>5) I dunno. Get married?<br/><br/>Fun thing: Goblin shapeshifting as silent commentary on whatever's going on.

Long hiatus. We played through more Nightport, and then wrapped up as Real Life began to intervene.  Below is the Last Post.<br/><br/>PS Flint's dead, man. Flint's dead.<br/><br/>------------------<br/><br/>A secret report within the Guild: In the 4th Year of the 17th Emperor, as requested, a report on the 'Nightport Incident' of last year.<br/><br/>First, as reported, the partial destruction (and hasty withdrawal) of the Imperial Fleet, along with the public 'apology' and subsequent burial of the Grand Admiral, did indeed occur. If anything, Imperial losses appear to be even higher than publicly reported.<br/><br/>Second, it is NOT true that elements within the Nightport leadership assisted the Imperials. From the moment that the Fleet reached Nightport space, all guns, ships, and associated hurtling metal were aimed squarely at the invaders. No evidence of any such plot.<br/><br/>Thirdly, it is true, however, that some elements of the Nightport leadership appear to have used the occasion to advance their own aims. Notably, the pirate Cyrus Vance, now the self-styled 'King of the Pirates', as well as Admiral Kale Arkam and 'Mayor' Snargle are now forces to be reckoned with in Nightport. <br/><br/>Fourthly, efforts by the Valkyrie Squadron to locate and retrieve Natasha Syri, Lady Blackbird, did indeed fail. Her whereabouts are unknown, although possibly she eloped with the pirate Flint, as his ship has not been seen since that night.<br/><br/>So, no, we do not see the need to continue funding the Valkyrie's research. Also, please stop asking for more agents for Nightport. They are the least of our worries now that the sky-squid have begun using weapons.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261480/#Comment_261480" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-11T13:47:56+00:00" title="March 11, 2010  1:47PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow.
