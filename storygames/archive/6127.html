In Forge parlance, these are pure flags -- i.e. the player takes them to communicate to the GM and other players what he is interested in.  So if I take a Hunted, I'm saying that's the sort of enemy I would like -- and the mechanics require the GM to provide that enemy at a certain frequency rather than unrelated enemies.  However, they can't be actively used by the player.  <br/><br/>A number of later games like Theatrix (1993) and The Babylon Project (1997) introduced a variant mechanics where players got rewards when the weakness actually appeared in play.  The latter has the advantage of being more automatically balancing, and it introduces an incentive for players to make the weakness appear.  <br/><br/>In terms of play, though, this incentive seems tricky to me -- because it asks me to work against myself as a player.  i.e. To portray my character well, I make the character try to avoid her weaknesses.  However, I am encouraged to make out-of-character choices to thwart my character's desires and have her weaknesses preyed upon.  I find that it is a tricky line to walk.  This seems related to the <a href="http://random-average.com/TheoryTopics/CzegePrinciple" rel="nofollow"><b>Czege Principle</b></a>, though not identical.  <br/><br/>As a Spirit of the Century GM, I have a sheet of PC Aspects, and I go through them to regularly hit PCs with Compels from them.  By SotC, players can suggest compels, but it is per se up to the GM to offer them -- and in practice usually I make the offers.  The balance works well for me -- which is to say that I think I prefer avoiding weaknesses and having other people bring them up.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136574/#Comment_136574" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-26T18:30:21+00:00" title="March 26, 2008  6:30PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think this is the Czege Principle.

In my experience in point buy systems players don't REALLY want the disadvantage.  What they want is the extra skill level in Sniper or the Eidetic Memory advantage.  Taking disadvantages is just the cost of getting what you really want...and since most early games made disadvantages something that really hurt (often to the point of being really unfun to have come out in play) most players intentionally tried to take disadvantages that would never be used against them...a far cry from using them as flags.  That this attitude was pretty common place can be seen in the efforts by games like Shadowrun to tie the number of points you get to how frequently the disadvantage will affect you and how nasty the effect will be when it does.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136588">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136588/#Comment_136588" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-26T22:12:44+00:00" title="March 26, 2008 10:12PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>i.e. To portray my character well, I make the character try to avoid her weaknesses.

I'll be making a character and I'll be like, "hey, you know what is awesome? Being afraid of snakes. I will take a fear of snakes, and then we can have some scenes where I have to crawl through a tunnel filled with snakes to get the holy grail." Then, a couple weeks later, I'm playing a game where my character might get killed if I make some bad tactical or strategic decisions, or I'm feeling all into my character's skin, and then there is a whole fucking temple filled with fucking cobras. My response, in that moment, is to nuke the whole site from orbit, just to be sure. <br><br>The things we do when we set up characters, and the things we do in the moment of play (especially in systems or groups with unstable or unstated pressures), can very easily contradict each other. <br><br>John, <br><br>That's an interesting point about compels. See, I don't like the compel rule in SotC for about the reason you do like it. When characters in my games get in shit based on their Aspects, they get to grab a Fate Point -- just like grabbing XP in TSOY. I don't like having to wait for GM permission or putting the GM in charge of every compel. But, having heard your side of it, I see much more clearly why it works for groups it works for.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136598/#Comment_136598" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-27T00:33:02+00:00" title="March 27, 2008 12:33AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>I'm having trouble reconciling the two parts of your post.<br/><br/>Initially you describe disadvantages as flags...signals to the GM of what you as a player would like to see.<br/><br/>But then you say that disadvantages with rewards are tricky because as a player you try to avoid your weaknesses.<br/><br/>I don't understand how you can both "want to see" these things in play and then actively "try to avoid them".</blockquote>\nLet's say I'm playing Indiana Jones.  Sometimes I narrate about what he is thinking and doing, and sometimes I am narrating things outside of him.  It doesn't matter the systems here -- the latter could be using Unisystem Drama Points, SotC Invoking for Effect, or various other mechanics.  When I am narrating about what Indiana is doing, I will describe him making decisions that involve him avoiding snakes.  If I didn't do this, I wouldn't feel I was doing a good job of characterization.  Thus, insofar as those actions go, I am actively avoiding snakes.  <br/><br/>I'm trying to picture the opposite of this, but it seems odd.  Do some people simply narrate Indy deliberately seeking out snakes?  That seems odd to me, though I'd be interested to hear.  I would think that the difference as far as me personally is that some people are fine with narrating both sides of the opposition.  i.e. They narrate Indy trying to avoid snakes, and then narrate how his efforts fail and he has to deal with snakes anyway.  I prefer not to do this.  <br/><br/>I don't think that's particularly strange.  There are many things that I enjoy <i>other players</i> doing in an RPG that I wouldn't enjoy doing all by myself.  For example, I enjoy many dialogue scenes consisting of two players speaking primarily in-character.  However, I rarely enjoy playing two characters in discussion with each other.  Thus, there's something that I want another player to do, that I don't want to do myself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136602">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136602/#Comment_136602" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-27T01:34:09+00:00" title="March 27, 2008  1:34AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 27, 2008 1:34AM by noclue.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite><br/>Let's say I'm playing Indiana Jones.

He is just confronted by a room full of them. Often he makes the conscious choice to go through a room full of snakes to achieve his goal. Other times he is locked in a pit with the critters by the bad guys.<br/><br/>In terms of narration in a game, narrating "Eek! Snakes! I failed to avoid them" misses the point. The presence of snakes has to add complications to the narrative, or it isn't increasing the fun. So, if Indy's fear of snakes made him drop his flashlight, that's a complication. Grab a fate point. How are the snakes making things more difficult for the PC to succeed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136604">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136604/#Comment_136604" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-27T03:58:43+00:00" title="March 27, 2008  3:58AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've seen a lot of the Fear avoidance thing in play, where the players end up in a massive argument about how, sure, they are overconfident, or curious, or a kleptomaniac .... but not *this* time. *This* time there is some reason why they should get away without acting that way.<br/><br/>Now I've tried the SOTC technique in other games, offering people something (a mechanical reward) for giving in to those traits in situations where they might otherwise want to resist, but it doesn't work that well and it often feels sort of hollow and silly to me.

Why did it have to be snakes?"<br/>"Asps! Vipers! Very dangerous -- you go first." [GM holds up a Fate point, signaling the compel]<br/><br/>costs Indy a Fate point when his player says, "Okay, even though I'm afraid of snakes, I gulp hard and let them lower me into the chamber" and hands the GM a Fate token. Later, he can recoup that Fate point by self-compelling a game-mechanical penalty to his skills when dealing with the snakes, trading reduced effectiveness for more game-currency.<br/><br/>If Indie'd said, "No way do I go down there until we get rid of the snakes!" then the GM would've handed over the Fate point.<br/><br/>So the player isn't authoring his or her own adversity; there's still a negotiation between two players over what the character faces and how he or she responds                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136742/#Comment_136742" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-27T22:36:20+00:00" title="March 27, 2008 10:36PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrand, I don't know.  Your example doesn't strike me as avoiding snakes or contradicting at all.  You selected "fear of snakes" because it would be awesome to see what your character would do when confronted with snakes...you then went and found some snakes (or the GM gave them to you cuz you flagged them) and we saw what you did...you went totally off your rocker and nuked the whole place from orbit. The whole point to such a "disadvantage" is to see how it complicates your life...sounds to me like it just complicated your life a hella lot...especially if you weren't authorized to go nuclear...<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn, I don't know your example either.  I don't think its particularly kosher to use an example of a character feature from fiction and then find it odd to expect that character feature to be featured the way it is in fiction.  Its not at all odd to narrate Indy seeking out snakes...after all that's exactly what the screen writer did when he wrote the movie.  Indy may not have wanted snakes, but the screen writer did.  That's basic author stance.  The concept of a player actively and intentionally blocking themselves from having the fun they want to have is what seems odd to me.  After all, you picked the flag because you thought it would be fun...spending your limited valuable time at the table intentionally avoiding your desired fun makes no sense whatsoever.  As far as characterization...I think that's completely backwards.  You characterize Indy's fear of snakes by having him confronted with snakes...and then demonstrate his character in reacting to them.  We learn alot about indy in the movie by the fact that we know he hates snakes...yet at that moment, he perserveres anyway.  You don't characterize Indy's fear of snakes by avoiding snakes...if we never see him interact with his fear...then we learn nothing of his character...no characterization occurs at all...he might as well have had a fear of sweat socks.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I don't think it has anything at all to do with narrating both sides of the opposition...what opposition?  There's no conflict with the snakes.  The snakes aren't the opponent.  At most they're a complicating factor in the real conflict (saving the girl and escaping).

Placing your character in the face of adversity allows you to make a more powerful and clear statement of who your character is than without the adversity.  Just like Indy on a mission provides a more compelling view of who he really is than him making dinner at home and reading some papers, so does the fact he crosses a room full of snakes is more compelling than if it were filled by a poisonous plant.  If your fun as a player is coming from portraying a character accurately then a situation that forces adversity should increase that rather than diminish.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite><br>And I don't think it has anything at all to do with narrating both sides of the opposition...what opposition?

The <i>fear</i> of snakes is the obstacle being faced and must be overcome before moving on to the next conflict.  It would be an equally valid choice to turn back and abandon the girl rather risk paralyzing fear and likely horrible death (at least in the character's mind), the choice to continue makes a strong statement about who the character is and what he values.  The problem arises given the poor tools (in anything I've seen) to address internal conflicts.  The two approaches I've seen to internal conflict resolution I've seen are player fiat, a clear violation of the Czege principle if you introduced the object of fear yourself; or a simple conflict resolution which has always struck me as kinda lame and deprotagonizing especially from an actor stance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136903">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136903/#Comment_136903" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-29T10:07:35+00:00" title="March 29, 2008 10:07AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 29, 2008 10:11AM by noclue.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>But that's what I said.

I think it may well be a preference thing, but I've thought about this one in depth. Basically, to keep going with the parallel, we want Indy to be threatened, but we also want him to win. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat's key, the character with whom we identify, we want to win. This is typical of RPG play (though, again, far from universal), and is how I almost always feel about my characters. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhich is not the same as saying that we're disappointed if the character fails. Well... this is difficult...<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen watching a horror movie, we "want" to be scared. When watching a tear-jerker, we "want" to be sad. These are "negative" emotions that we generally experience by sympathizing with the characters in the drama. We "want" them to fail, because that's part of horror or sadness, or just setting up victory later to be sweeter. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut we don't "root" for them to fail. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe don't shout, "Go in the temple, Indy, so you can find snakes in there!" We shout, "Go in the temple to find the Ark, and win... even if you have to face some snakes which you hate, which will prove how strong your desires are, or show how human you are!" That last part being even more tacit than the first. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe point is that we, as players, though we understand and like the downsides of the drama, are like the moviegoer cheering Indy on... advocates for the character's success.<br/>\n<br/>\nI choose that term very precisely. Yes, when cheering in the theatre, we don't rationally assume that our cheers and advocacy through good thoughts for the character will really help him win. But, like sympathizing with your favorite sports team, we still engage in this bit of sympathetic magic. By doing so, we make the success of the target feel like ours. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn a roleplaying game, this is made all the moreso true, because we actually can affect the character's chances for success. By, for instance, looking cleverly at the character's areas of effectiveness, and using them to maximal profit for the character. <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, we min-max for the character. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow the "problem" comes in when we then take on character victory or success as a measure of our own victory or success. If we can be accounted as having these positive effects on the character's outcomes, are we not showing off our own tactial prowess? And, if so, don't we likely have gamism? And therefore not narrativism or something else? <br/>\n<br/>\nWell...<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is where things get very, very tricky. I think that it is quite possible to both advocate for the character, and not to take credit for his success. Perhaps taught, in fact, by cheering poitlessly for Indy, we learn to try to modify the character's outcomes positively, but also expect no credit for doing so. Instead, the reward is getting a good story. <br/>\n<br/>\nBecause there is a flip-side to creation of conflict, and that's the creation of solutions, or at least potential solutions. This is the creative input of such a player. It is precisely, to me, the Czege Principle that we're talking about here. The reason that it's unfun to give us the role of creating the conflict and/or it's resolution, is because we then take on some of the "blame" for the character's loss. We lose that sympathetic magic that connects us to the character. We indeed become the "author" now, and are no longer the advocate for the character, but for the story. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd this, for me at least, goes over the line. Oh, to be sure, I'll have my character do stupid things, or do things that are likely to result in trouble for him. But I do so expecting the GM to hammer my character. Not me. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is why, in fact, Universalis (and games like it) are so different to me from "traditional" RPG play. I can, in fact, be the author of a character to the extent that I'm just creating a story - that's it's own sort of great fun. But there are times where I want to simply collaborate in the story, my role in the process only being that of beign the advocate for the character's success. With the GM or some other force being responsible for the forces that actually cause the negatives for the character. So that, like Indy, whom I did not write, I can sympathize more. <br/>\n<br/>\nNone of that is particularly rational behavior. But that doesn't move me at all on the subject. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_137204">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frederik%20J.%20Jensen" title="Frederik J.
