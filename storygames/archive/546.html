                    This is a thought sparked by the "Sexual Abuse in Games":http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=524&amp;page=1 that occurred to me all of a sudden.  Actually it's Ben's comment:<br/>
<br/>
bq. All this talk about playing with someone who has been abused, and what that would be like?<br/>
<br/>
bq. _You already have._<br/>
<br/>
was the flint for this one.  There was an on-going theme of "we're leery of approaching childhood sexual abuse for fear of trivializing real suffering."  And my own feeling in that regard relates strongly to the way that movies, television and comics has abused abuse as a plot element.<br/>
<br/>
But here's the thing: I can't think of an example of play that relates to other kinds of very close, very real tragedies.<br/>
<br/>
Part of that might be identifying conflicts that would have the same sort of difficulty-in-play to them without necessarily being the same emotional structure.  <br/>
<br/>
As a haphazard example of a situation, I'm going to throw down Enron and it's employees.  Thousands of people worked for a Fortune 10 company for decades, trusting them to live up to their pension agreements.  There is certainly at least one person at the verge of retirement, who has committed to a certain living arrangement, and certain relationships with a small, otherwise poor family, who's spent the last 3 years trying to put together something out of what they have left.  That character strikes me as both analogous and very different from an "abused as a child" character, but ultimately there's a betrayal of trust that directly impacts their whole life.<br/>
<br/>
What I'm trying to get at is this: does sexual abuse stand as a bugaboo in front of a huge territory of difficult to tell stories, which might be likewise rewarding to play out?  Does anyone have hypothetical or actual examples of this kind of story, or thoughts on whether or not there's any validity to the characterization of sexual abuse in RPGS?                </div>

                            An interesting thought.  I have no idea how to answer.  I flail around blindly:<br/><br/>Is sexual abuse fetishized in our culture?  Yes, certainly.<br/><br/>Are the actual incidences and real tragedies of sexual abuse fairly represented in our media?  Probably not something that can be adequately or even fairly measured.<br/><br/>Is sexual abuse used because it's easier than other abuses and tragedies?  Probably.  But I think that it's used instead of other things for reasons beyond its "appeal" to sex-crazed western civilization.  It's also a very common tragedy -- not common as in frequent, but common as in something that could happen (or could have happened) to any of us.  A disenfranchised Enron employee, on the other hand, may not be a character that a wide audience can relate to or sympathize with.<br/><br/>The thing about roleplaying, though, is that, since it is a relatively private and small-scale phenomenon, it can be used to address themes and content that a wider audience may be disinterested in.  It's perfectly feasible to run a game set in the home town of the players, for instance, and even tackle some local poltical questions in the course of play.  Hm.  Intriguing thought.                        </div>

<p>I'd say that our culture's concept of innocence has more to do with it, although I suppose it's debatable.</p>
<p>There's a ladder of innocence, starting with babies, then little girls, followed by little boys, followed by women of any age, then elderly men, and finally the rest of the population. When writers wants to to frighten us or illicit our sympathy for a victim or show how heinous someone is, they pick someone at least as innocent as the most common member of their audience, judged on this scale. The stronger the reaction desired, the higher up the scale they move.</p>
<p>This is why, in teen slasher movies, although teens of both sexes get offed, the tendency is to make the main character be a teen <em>girl</em>, because teen boys aren't seen to be as innocent as girls. If they want to up the ante, the horror writers will have the teen girl be a <em>babysitter</em>, so that a little kid can be threatened.</p>

<i>I can't think of an example of play that relates to other kinds of very close, very real tragedies.</i><br/><br/>Well, I don't delve that much into such tragedies in the first place -- but I can certainly see dealing with it in the game.  Suicide would be a pretty major one, say.  My Buffy game has usually been fairly light-hearted, but in the four-part ending to last season, a PCs girlfriend found that she was becoming an evil avatar (as planned by her parents) and ripped her own throat out.  <br/><br/>We've also been a lot of lesser issues which are also close.  It is, after all, set in Silicon Valley dealing with a bunch of IT employees.  So, regarding your Enron example, we dealt with a lot of workplace issues.  2.14 was "The Glass Ceiling", the height of which was a pitched battle with blood-thirsty fey spirits (Sluagh) in a pyramid, while the architect of this was looking down on everyone.                        </div>

                            Wow, a lot of really worthwhile response.<br/>
<br/>
bq. You've never played a game where someone had their inheritance stolen from them?<br/>
<br/>
I'm familiar with the trope.  But somehow an exiled prince and a disinherited son, while essentially the same thing, doesn't seem analogous.  Maybe because it is a troupe in a certain kind of fantasy.  It's an occupational hazard of being a prince in a intrigue-y fantasy setting.  And a prince's dis-inheritance becomes his motivation to reconquer his father's lands, or seek his fortune.  A single father's disinheritance could be his whole conflict.<br/>
<br/>
bq. Fortunately, in role-playing, you can give a non-valid portrayal and you won't be hurting anyone, because no one consumes that media but you.<br/>
<br/>
This I think is the biggest hit to my preconceptions.  In the privacy of my own home, with people who are close to me, I still feel like there's something -unworthy- -wrong- with racial jokes, for instance.  Just because no one is _there_ to be offended doesn't make it less respectful.  <br/>
<br/>
And part of the wrong you do is to yourself.  If you have an unhealthy or callous understanding of someone, voicing and approving that understand reinforces it.  <br/>
<br/>
So, no, you aren't influencing a large audience, but you are influencing an audience.<br/>
<br/>
And it seems like ??Strong At Heart?? ought to join my reading queue.<br/>
<br/>
bq. The stronger the reaction desired, the higher up the scale they move.<br/>
<br/>
There's something profoundly and utterly wrong with that.  Something completely cynical and mercinary, that strikes me as an affront to storytelling as an art and to simple human decency.<br/>
<br/>
bq. Suicide would be a pretty major one<br/>
<br/>
Well, duh - _that's_ a good example.  Enron and pensions are one thing, but the suicide of a loved one or close associate is much more in the realm I'm thinking of.   But Lovecraftian self-horror, or the rescue of others by means of self-sacrifice doesn't strike me as quite the same.  <br/>
<br/>
I guess I'm seeing two separate issues: first the ethical one of treating very real tragedies in the context of a game -- in other words with at least a part of the intent to entertain oneself and one's friends.  Second, if there's a right way (or even no wrong way) to treat them, how can they be treated well?                        </div>

<p>And yet, there it is. It's related to the idea that, to be frightening, the victim should be untainted. If the monster kills a 40-year-old man, unless the writer has taken steps to paint a full portrait of that character and somehow establish his innocence, there's the chance some of the audience may make unwarranted assumptions and think the victim "deserved it". Many writers would rather play on our natural instincts to protect the vulnerable. Children are a sure thing for this purpose, and in our sexist society, women are also regarded as vulnerable and get used by writers in the same way.</p>
<p>There's a similar thing that happens in Mystery stories (as opposed to crime stories or noir.) The ideal detective is one who is an amateur sleuth rather than a professional, or at least so G. K. Chesterton claimed, because the professionals are in a sense tainted. Thus, Holmes, the scholar who takes an interest in criminology, is superior to Scotland Yard.</p>
<p>I wish I could remember where I first encountered the theory of ladders of innocence in horror movies. The idea is not original with me, just that term "ladder of innocence" is. I think I saw something on it in The Straight Dope, or maybe it was a minor point in that Chesterton essay I mentioned.</p>

I think an RPG can be at least as good as Eminem at driving stories toward confrontation of uncomfortable issues.<br/><br/>Judson, here's my answer to your original second question:  I'm Catholic, and in 2001 when the clergy-sex-abuse scandal first exploded, I had difficulty accepting the scale of media coverage compared to the available evidence.  More evidence has since come forward, and I've accepted the fact that church leaders shuffled abusive priests around and tried to cover up a list of horrible, chronic misdeeds.  But that doesn't mean I like hearing or reading jokes about priests and sex abuse; it doesn't change my belief that there were liars who used the scandal to extract money from (or settle grudges with) an organization that can't pay its employees minimum wage.<br/><br/>Say you've got four characters who all know each other, all around the same age.  Two have come forward claiming to have suffered abuse from a priest as children, and two have not.  Two of them were actually abused--but we don't know which two from the outset.<br/><br/>Would I watch a movie with that setup?  Almost certainly not.  Would I read the book?  Unlikely.<br/><br/>Would I play the game, if I trusted everyone involved?  Hell yes.                        </div>

                            I remember dealing with the intersection of real tragedy and fictional tragedy during the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. I played in a couple of World of Darkness LARP games in upstate New York. These games were committed to being contemporary and "real-time," so that current events in the game were as close as possible to current events in real life.<br/><br/>The reponse of the players to the attacks was unanimous: in our game worlds, they did not happen. We couldn't address it or deal with it in fiction while we were still reeling in real life. It took months (if not a year or so) before anyone felt comfortable even mentioning it in a fictionalized context. Eventually, once the horror had faded, we gradually began to treat it as a past event in the game. But we never addressed it directly.                        </div>

                            Joshua:  Hmm.  I'm...  not entirely sure where your comment is coming from?  Judson asked about examples of sexual abuse standing as a bugaboo in front of difficult and worthwhile stories, and I think my setup fits that mold.  You mentioned the intriguing possibilities of using games to address issues specific to us that might not matter to a larger audience; I think the discussion about the church scandals was and is pretty polarized, and that an even-handed examination is unlikely to appeal to everyone who's already chosen a side.<br/>
<br/>
From your lynching example, though, it seems like you're looking for ways to Play The Other--to confront powerful issues that have little, directly, to do with me.  I think that's important, but I'm honestly not sure gaming is the best medium for it.                        </div>

                            Brendan -- my thinking goes like this.  Judson asked if sexual abuse stood in for other things in gaming (and culture at large).  You gave an example of sexual abuse being treated as it is for itself.  The question being, can you play the 'other thing' instead of dressing it up in the common trappings of easy innocence and easy tragedy?                        </div>

I felt like your example was useful and interesting, and I see where it's coming from.  I think Josh's point is that part of the hesitancy (at least mine) to approach sexual abuse, or racial violence, or personal (i.e. non-heroic) suicide, is that while I want to address those issues to try to understand them, they aren't issues that have a lot of bearing on my life.  In other words: _they aren't my issues._<br/>
<br/>
So if they're not my issues, is there a real reason to think that there's an ethical issue with treating them?  I draw the analogy to racial jokes because, I can simultaneously understand that it's insulting to tell my friends who are blessed with a different skin color than my own how "well spoken" they are, and admit that racial jokes can be funny.  <br/>
<br/>
Josh's point about the KKK is salient, but moreso because it makes clear how fuzzy the whole issue is.  Isn't it equally wrong so pretend, for instance, that there are no racially based subcultures in this country?  Moreso to pretend that sexual abuse or suicide doesn't happen, or is somehow a disgrace for its victims?<br/>
<br/>
If you'll excuse me I've got a yard deep furrow in my brow I need to go unkink.                        </br></br></div>

                            Ah, thanks for the clarification, guys.  I misread Judson's request as "examples of non-bugaboo sex abuse," instead of "examples of non-sex abuse bugaboo."<br/>
<br/>
In that case I go back to my response at the end of the original sex abuse thread: the particular horror of it, to me, is lasting pain inflicted on human beings as a direct result of their incomplete agency.  What if we substitute "torture" or "mutilation" for the "lasting pain" part of that?  What if we substitute "slaves" or "disabled people" as a reason for lacking agency?<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, I look at the interpolation and I'm even <i>less</i> comfortable than I would be with playing child abuse.  I think those are less prevalent in popular media; I don't know if that makes them less "easy" as setups for discomfort.  I definitely think that Western culture has weird and deep-set issues ready to go for any such disenfranchised group, so maybe, if we use my abstraction of abuse, the bugaboo is a given.                        </div>

                            I don't know how much one can generalize across games.  For example, in our group, we avoid non-heroic suicide, genocide and overt sexual abuse, because we have people in our group whose lives have been profoundly affected by those things.  Nonetheless, we're perfectly happy confronting institutionalized racism and sexism, mental deterioration with age (and <i>there's</i> a really touchy subject if you want one), slavery, disability, betrayals of trust, you name it, as long as it's not something someone in the group has a problem with.  We're even approaching the latter two of our super-touchy topics (genocide and sexual abuse), albeit delicately and slowly.  We'll see how it goes.<br><br>I have no idea if I answered the question, but maybe I can try a different approach by listing some of the other things that I think are as tricky as sexual abuse:<br><br>- suicide<br/>- mental deterioration with age<br/>- realistically portrayed mental illness<br/>- miscarriage and infertility<br/>- autism and other developmental disorders<br/>- genocide<br/>- racism and religious discrimination<br/>- terminal disease<br/><br/>I'm not sure what these things have in common, or if anyone else would agree with my list, but that's what comes from my gut when I think about these things.<br/><br/>--Jess                        </br></br></br></br></div>
