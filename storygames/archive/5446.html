Each player had both a combat role and a social role in the group, and the game was designed from the beginning to be tightly-knit.  They played four 12-14 year old Akavar warriors who started a summer before this situation: <br/><br/><a href="http://www.greathundred.org/Akavars" rel="nofollow">An Akavan approaches its rite of passage.</a><br/><br/>We played through their rite of passage, into their first forays into the mercenary world, and on to them teaming up with their characters' fathers to beat an external threat to their village.  5 sessions, and it was so awesome.  For weeks afterwards they were bringing up the word "Akavan" in conversation as if it were a real word.<br/><br/>What game gave you the best experiences of camaraderie?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122105">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122105/#Comment_122105" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-26T20:14:33+00:00" title="January 26, 2008  8:14PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd have to say two home-brews, both of which, fortunately, stole pretty heavily from established games.<br/><br/>Bunyip was the game of "work together to survive in a hostile environment despite one of you being a homicidal shapeshifting monster", originally designed by a friend of mine. I was teaking up a new system for it (it's seen, like, five or six over the years), and I stole a page from the Mountain Witch, in that more or less the only way to get a bonus to your success to do anything was to get help from another PC. While most of the PCs start off as wary due to this help potentially giving the Bunyip an opportunity to reveal themselves and kill you, once the Bunyip IS revealed, the surviving characters band together into a cohesive unit of ass-kicking that's pretty impressive to watch.<br/><br/>QAESG was my simple and straightforward game attempt to introduce the concept of stake-setting to my D&amp;D/WoD/etc favoring group. Among the various sorts of traits you could claim were Relationships, which gave you a bonus whenever the person in question was named on either side of the stakes, for good or ill. In one game, I and another player each took relationships with the other's character, and BANG. Every session we spent was basically back to back, protecting the other from danger while heedless to threats against ourselves. It was one of the most tight-knit friendships I've ever seen in any game I've been in, and while it was motivated OOC by pure lust for cold hard mechanical efficiency, in-game it had no motivation other than the camaraderie you speak of.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122106">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/orklord" title="orklord"><img alt="orklord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nBSO1M13J7CVK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/orklord">orklord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122106/#Comment_122106" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-26T20:26:25+00:00" title="January 26, 2008  8:26PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had the most camaraderie in D&amp;D 2nd edition.  There were still defined party roles and alignments that worked together if they aligned.  The party system worked well in my group back in the day.<br/><br/>The Star Wars d6 games I played in during college had a thrilling sense of group cohesion, but that wasn't from the rules or even the setting, really.  I just really loved my friends in that game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122129">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco" title="Ogremarco"><img alt="Ogremarco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/25764803/403381"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco">Ogremarco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122129/#Comment_122129" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-26T23:04:05+00:00" title="January 26, 2008 11:04PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran a single session of Don't Rest Your head for two co-workers and the concern their characters showed for each other was almost shocking, other than that it was the GURPS Imperial Guard/Band of Brothers hack I just mentioned in Matt's Dark Heresy thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122210">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122210/#Comment_122210" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-27T14:44:22+00:00" title="January 27, 2008  2:44PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The best feelings of camaraderie I've had in games have always come from the longest campaigns, where people are most invested in their characters and their group. My current GURPS campaign is less than a year old, so it's not quite got to that level yet, but the one before, which was many years long, got amazingly close.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
