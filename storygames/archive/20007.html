If you'd like to see them, PM me your email.<br/><br/>My advice:<br/>- Use the town-creation steps in the book as written.<br/>- During that process, invest in your NPCs; get into imagining them.  Make each one of them good <i>and</i> bad in their own ways.  No straight-up villains, no angels.  Make them normal people, more or less.<br/>- Once you have a town full of tensions and enmities between normal people, you have something for the players to judge.  So, let them judge it.  Reveal everything to them quickly, so they can spend the bulk of play deciding what to do about it, acting on those decisions, and seeing what falls out.<br/>- The rest is on the players.  You can guide them, though, during character creation and Initiations.<br/><br/>Player guidance:<br/>- Make sure that they make characters who have opinions and bases for judgment.  The only way a good town can fail is if the characters are indifferent to it, or if they think there's a "one right answer" to be "found".  Make sure each Dog has a strong personal sense of justice, whatever that may be.<br/>- I prefer to play with Dogs who do not agree on what justice means, but are not generally willing to shoot each other over the differences.  That's just me, though -- think about what works best for your group: whether they like arguing, killing each other, pure teamwork, or what.<br/>- If your players need a lot of material to work with before making good characters, introduce your town to them before character creation.  Tell them the basic nature of the trouble in town, and then drop the names of some key NPCs.  Optionally, allow the players to invent relationships to the NPCs -- "Enoch, the aging steward, is my father's enemy," or, "Duty, the accused outsider, once saved my life."<br/><br/>Hope that helps!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442444">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442444/#Comment_442444" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-04T01:04:31+00:00" title="February  4, 2015  1:04AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 4, 2015 1:07AM by Paul_T.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's some other stuff:<br/><br/>* One of the few design issues in Dogs is that it doesn't "balance" for the number of players. If you have a large group, and the Dogs are into "teamwork" and work together, they'll find it effortless to win conflicts with single NPCs.<br/><br/>One or two Dogs are easily challenged by single NPCs. Three Dogs or four working together will not be, not even remotely.<br/><br/>For them, you need to include Sorcerers, gangs/crowds, and Demonic Influence.<br/><br/>Here's a thread on the topic, and conclusions:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/11969/dogs-splittin-the-dogs-ain-t-so-easy-sometimes#" rel="nofollow">Splitting the Dogs</a><br/><br/>* I always use the "Quick NPCs" rules from Vincent's blog, although the by-the-book procedure does lend more depth to NPCs. Instead, I write down their Traits as they come in play, which means that the NPCs gradually develop depth instead of my having to do it as prep.<br/><br/>* A random character creation procedure I came up with to generate characters (useful for people who've never played Dogs and don't know what it's like):<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/12372/dogs-in-the-vineyard-meet-random-character-creation" rel="nofollow">DitV Character Creation</a><br/><br/>* Make sure the NPCs have strong motivations and act on them as irrationally and impulsively as you like.<br/><br/>When they see the Dogs, they're not all, "Who are those people and why do we care?"<br/><br/>They're always like, "Oh, man! The Dogs! You need to marry me to my cousin, right now, before the Steward comes here! Please please do it now!"<br/><br/>Or maybe even run up to them, put a gun in their hands, kneel on the ground, and say: "I have sinned beyond the limits set upon us by the Almighty. Shoot me now and end my time here!"<br/><br/>They have demands, needs, fears, and the Dogs are the catalyst for them to spring into action. They hate them, fear them, idolize them, or see them as their only hope.<br/><br/>This gives instant impetus to any scene you have going on. The Dogs are *important*, and everyone in the Town is just waiting for them to arrive so they can finally fix everything and set it right.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442445">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442445/#Comment_442445" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-04T01:21:14+00:00" title="February  4, 2015  1:21AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 4, 2015 1:37AM by Paul_T.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's some more:<br/><br/>* <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/12353/suggestions-for-dogs-in-the-vineyard-rookie" rel="nofollow">DitV Rookie Advice</a><br/><br/>* Be careful about how adding Traits into a Raise works - learn to do it gracefully, but don't let people keep rolling in dice when they don't like the results they see. Narrate the Raise, roll in any applicable extra dice, then push forward two of them. No going back and forth, that kills the game.<br/><br/>* If possible, a great trick is to create Relationships for the Dogs by giving them each an initiation scene with an NPC. Then use those NPCs in your Town. (Plugging them in to the Town later, after you've written it up - "Ok, I guess I'll make Jeremiah's old mentor the Steward of this Town..." - is great.)<br/><br/>* Some <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=18275.msg193083#msg193083" rel="nofollow">great advice from Vincent</a> on character creation.<br/><br/>* As GM, I *love* Taking the Blow. <br/><br/>I wait for the Dogs to make some kind of strong move, and then I push forward a whole bunch of tiny little dice, giving the NPC tons of Fallout. If it was a gunshot... there's blood everywhere! If it was strong words, maybe they've reduced the Steward to tears, a quivering mess.<br/><br/>This is a powerful trick! The players will usually be in shock, and feel much less cocky afterwards.<br/><br/>In general, exaggerate the NPCs' reactions to what the Dogs do: if a Dog insults them, they're not slightly miffed, they're furious and desperate to get revenge. If the Dogs help them with something, they fall in love with them and ask to elope with them, or perhaps start a mob to overthrow the current Steward and put the Dog in his place. (And see how your players like <i>that</i>!)<br/><br/>This ramps up the drama but also makes it harder for the players to control what's going on, meaning they're more likely to start conflicts, escalate, and cause further problems.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442453">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Doctorduckbutter" title="Doctorduckbutter"><img alt="Doctorduckbutter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Doctorduckbutter">Doctorduckbutter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442453/#Comment_442453" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-04T14:26:27+00:00" title="February  4, 2015  2:26PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow this is a lot of stuff, thanks to all the people who posted on this, I have a lot of reading to do!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442461">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442461/#Comment_442461" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-04T19:50:34+00:00" title="February  4, 2015  7:50PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 4, 2015 7:52PM by Paul_T.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sometimes people get stuck on Relationships. What do we do with these dice?<br/><br/>Another great trick from John/jenskot:<br/><br/>He makes little headshots (photos) for each NPC in the Town. (Don't have too many; 4-6 is probably the best for a first-time Town, until you have reason, later in the game, to create more convoluted Towns which might take more than a session to play out.)<br/><br/>Lay out the pictures, each one with a name (and maybe a quick one-liner, like "The Steward's youngest daughter").<br/><br/>Tell the players, "Ok, I'm going to leave the table for 5 minutes. During that time, I want you each to come up with a relationship you have to two different NPCs. Feel free to make them as intense as you want: who do you lust for? Who owes you money, like a lot of money? Who have you sworn revenge against? Who are you desperately in love with? Who saved your life when you were a little boy/girl?"<br/><br/>"Feel free to leave some dice unassigned, or to establish a Relationship with another Dog, if you like."<br/><br/>Of course, you've already written up your Town, so when you come back you're in for a surprise. Maybe the Dogs are in love with your murderer, but hate the innocent old lady in your Town. (Although hopefully your NPCs aren't quite that black-and-white.)<br/><br/>The unexpected combination of these elements will be great fodder for drama.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>My own version of this, which requires more prep in advance:<br/><br/>* Have each player, when they create their character, come up with two NPCs. Each one should be someone they have REALLY strong feelings towards, whether positive or negative, and some shared history. <br/><br/>"My father, who abandoned me and beat my mother in front of me when I was little. I hate him more than anyone, I spit on his name."<br/><br/>"Prudence, my neighbour's daughter. I worship and idolize her."<br/><br/>Have the players share their NPCs with you. I had them e-mail their NPCs to me before the game, for example.<br/><br/>A sentence (or two, tops) per NPC is more than enough.<br/><br/>* In the meantime, write up a few Towns. (If you're just doing one Town, then one NPC per player would be enough.)<br/><br/>* Assign the NPCs numbers (I had four players and two NPCs per player, so I numbered them 1 through 8).<br/><br/>* Look at your list of NPCs for each Town, and pick a few at random. (I had four Towns planned, I think, so I picked two NPCs from each Town's writeup.)<br/><br/>For the sake of this example, let's say your person was the Steward of the Town, who was a sinner in your Town, and tempted by Sorcery.<br/><br/>* Now pick a player's NPC Relationship at random. Roll a die, for example.<br/><br/>Let's say it comes up with:<br/><br/>"5. Prudence, my neighbour's daughter. I worship and idolize her."<br/><br/>* Do whatever you have to do, but with the least amount of change, to make that NPC fit that role.<br/><br/>Here we end up with a really interesting Town, where the Steward is a young woman, who used to be one of the Dogs' neighbour's daughter, and is now a Sinner tempted by Sorcery.<br/><br/>Can a woman be Steward? Do people respect her?<br/><br/>Will the Dog decide he still loves her, and try to redeem her, join her cause, or what?<br/><br/>It's a bit of work (although it doesn't take more than an hour or so), but very well worth it for the payoff.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
