I suggest around 8.45pm that we should play InSpectres, and I get four people to agree to do so, although one of them seems a bit doubtful. I'd overheard him ahaving a conversation earlier about some horrifically dysfunctional roleplaying experiences he'd had previously.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, there's another group of guys who are doing set up and pre-chat for a planned D&amp;D campaign. They seem to mostly be talking about what kind of characters they will eventually make. It's reasonably quiet over there, and remains so throught our InSpectres game.<br/><br/>InSpectres goes well, as it always does, even if it is dominated ratehr by the more voluble members of the play group, something I try to compensate for by prompting the two newer, shyer players into action at various points. It's high energy, silly, and we can NOT. STOP. LAUGHING. At one point, a buxom Irishwoman character gets a 3 on her Academics roll to reattach someone's testicles, just removed due to an accident with a shovel. Since it's a 3, I ask the player to suggest how they failed, but with a beneficial side effect. He suggests "well, maybe she manages to reattach them <i>somewhere</i>".<br/><br/>I'm aware throughout this that the D&amp;D guys seem to be watching our table a lot. And, we're having a lot of fun and saying very silly things.<br/><br/>The whole thing is wrapped up, from franchise and character generation to the completion of the mission, in around an hour or so.<br/><br/>At the end, one of the newer guys, the guy who seemed a bit doubtful earlier, is asked if he enjoyed himself. He answers in the affirmative but then says:<br/><br/>"But it wasn't really <i>real</i> roleplaying."<br/><br/>I laugh in a sort-of "agreeing with what I think you mean" sort of way. <br/><br/>But I can't help but also be amused by the contrast between our hour or so of near continual laughter and the D&amp;D guys, talking about planning the chargen needed for playing their real roleplaying.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172560">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Georgios" title="Georgios"><img alt="Georgios" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Georgios">Georgios</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172560/#Comment_172560" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-02T07:18:26+00:00" title="October  2, 2008  7:18AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 2, 2008 7:18AM by Georgios.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Meserach</cite><br/>At the end, one of the newer guys, the guy who seemed a bit doubtful earlier, is asked if he enjoyed himself.

For some folks, that investment is critical to "roleplaying"- caring about the character, advocating for them, etc.  <br/><br/>It's partly a short-burn vs. long-burn issue- a longer running game gives a player more time to develop and understand their character (or characters), getting into the fine nuances of who they are and how they push and pull the overall story.  There's a different sort of pay-off for that investment than the over-the-top hilarity of a short-term game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172588">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Radaghast" title="Radaghast"><img alt="Radaghast" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/252/nT6IX77SIXBAG.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Radaghast">Radaghast</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172588/#Comment_172588" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-02T08:35:39+00:00" title="October  2, 2008  8:35AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't really think this is unique to those D&amp;D guys that you seem to have some kind of grudge against.

She basically argued that Yoga isn't real excercising, because "you're enjoying it". To be fair, she meant that it didn't feel quite as punishing as long sprints or weight lifting can quickly become. <br/><br/>If it's too easy, it's not real somehow. A very useless standard to impose on something you do in your free time, but oh well...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173332">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173332/#Comment_173332" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-05T11:23:57+00:00" title="October  5, 2008 11:23AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Meserach</cite>what we were doing (speaking in character, advancing a fictional scenario, etcetera)</blockquote>I too find this part funny. You were speaking in character, you had a shared imaginary space, you had a narrative plot emerge, you had resolution of tasks, and still it was "not roleplaying."<br/><br/>And...there's a part of me that goes, "Yeah, I know what the dude means. Clearly not real roleplaying." There's this other part that looks at me and says "Wha?" Then there's this third part that asks if it really matters what its called, as long as its enjoyable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
