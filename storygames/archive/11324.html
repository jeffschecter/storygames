Though it's not super tactical or finnicky.<br/>Each element is as streamlined as possible, though it does have: units, heroes, spells, tech trees, rounds, weapon bonuses, populations, settlement upgrades.<br/><br/>"It's like Smallworld meets Civilization, and it requires 3 hours."<br/><br/>Each race grows and advances differently, and has different tech tree options/paths/forks.<br/><br/>The humans grow their population by building new towns.<br/>Their towns become more productive when they are connected to other towns (via roads, or open spaces).<br/>Humans have champions, who bolster the productivity of an town or the fighting ability of a unit.<br/>Champions grow restless if you keep them in a town or unit too long. Restlessness leads to <i>corruption</i>.<br/>To avoid restlessness, you need to either bribe them (pay gold to them) or promote them (move them to a better unit or town).<br/>You can have many Champions, but too many somehow becomes unwieldy.<br/><br/>Human goals:<br/>Build many towns. Connect towns via roads. Use units &amp; champions to protect those roads, to keep towns productive. Continually promote champions to avoid corruption.<br/><br/>Each dwarven force/nation has exactly one female: the queen.<br/>The dwarves grow their population by pleasing their queen, with gold and skulls.<br/>Dwarves are more effective when they are closer to their queen.<br/>Dwarves can burrow &amp; tunnel!<br/>When the gold is depleted in a given hold, the queen will stop producing offspring, and may grow violent. Moving time!<br/>There is no benefit from having additional settlements, aside from possibly setting up blockades and battle fronts.<br/><br/>Dwarf goals:<br/>Set up a hold in a place with lots of gold. Spawn many dwarves. Draw an attack to your hold, where your dwarves are strongest (so that you can please the queen with skulls). When resources are low, flee to a new hold.<br/><br/>How do the elves operate?

Of course, they've always been there, they just weren't ready to join the fight until now.<br/>The problem is... the woods aren't all in one place...<br/>And you actually need to send someone to these newly awakened elves, in order to recruit them and guide them back to a Citadel (so they can be trained and put to work).<br/>So there's an incentive to either build a citadel in every forest, or to train some ultra fast recon troops to patrol the forests and pluck up the new elves (LONG PATROL!!!!!!)<br/>Elves don't have a lot of buildings to make... only arrow towers, palisades and citadels.<br/>However, what they lack in architectural options they make up for in free advances on the tech trees.<br/><br/>Elf goals:<br/>Protect the forests. Build citadels. Collect new elves from the forests on the map, and guide them to the citadels. Gain technological domination.<br/><br/><br/>Thoughts?<br/>Potemkin, does it clash with your original idea?

Gold &amp; skulls are the twin obsessions of dwarven queens, but I think each race should require different resources.<br/><br/>So, to summarize what you said and add some twists:<br/><br/>Orcs don't have settlements.<br/>They have a horde. And that horde is led by a Demon.<br/>And when a new Demon emerges, a duel is fought.<br/>Sometimes the two Demon live, and the horde splits. Other times, the new destroys the old, and the horde changes leadership.<br/>If a horde gets too small, dig an orc-pit and pull new orcs out of the earth.<br/>To dig an orc-pit, first you need to desecrate the land.<br/>If a horde gets too big, the Demon will develop <i>corruption</i>. If a horde stays in one place too long, it develops <i>corruption</i>.<br/>Corruption manifests in an inability to control the horde, and in-fighting.<br/>Orcs gain their resources from raiding. That's also where they gain their tech.<br/><br/>Orc goals:<br/>Desecrate the land. Build orc-pits. Gain new recruits and keep moving. Attempt to split the horde when it gets too big. Gain resources and tech through raiding. Don't let your horde get too big.<br/><br/>The cool thing is that if a horde gets too big, you aren't fully in control of whether or not it can divide. You can create a new demon (hoping that the two demons will part ways), but there's some chance that it'll just kill the old demon and continue to expand the horde.

It costs 10 (say) Tokens to spawn a Fairy Prince and his entourage (a set-number of fairy army-units) at a neutral location. Tokens are gained by capturing gold or skulls and returning with them to the spawn-point. Fairies have 0 infrastructure but no army-in-force until perhaps the late game if they can play hit-and-run successfully. <br/> <br/>Sorcerer Kings: Sorcerer Kings start at their tower and cannot move from it themselves. If the tower falls, it's game over. Sorcerer kings must summon imps and demons to act for them in the wider world.

Maybe there are a number of Treasures that give advantages (strategic or score-wise). Tradition would dictate that they be something like the Cauldron, the Navel of the World stone (gives control over terrain?), a magic sword (the hero wielding it can call out the opposing leader for a 1-on-1 fight to decide the battle, modified by the size of the army), and a magic horn (makes allies of neutrals, makes enemies flee, makes friends rally).</p>\n<p>I'd suggest Mechaton-style multiple scores.

These elves bear some great similarities to the D&amp;D concept of Dryads.   Elves are effectively immortal: If an elf is killed they are reborn at their tree, if their forest is cut down they die.  Elves can't build their armies up over time, they are completely reliant on the land they control.  Elves are generally weak combat units, but losing armies will generally not set them back as they all leap back out of their trees.  Attacking their territory rather than their armies is the only way to set them back more than a turn or two.  Elven forces are extremely difficult to grow as the only way to acquire more is to plant and grow new forests, a time consuming effort.  Humans and Orcs are a constant threat against Elves as they cut down or desecrate forests for their own expansion leading to a constant attempt to defend their forests.  While Dwarves rarely attack their forests they still are a danger to Elves because after they finish stripping an area through mining, the damage to the soils nutrients weakens all nearby forests making those Elves weaker or making their rebirth take longer than usual.  This leads Elves to wanting to attack Dwarven settlements to slow or stop their progress and the Dwarves will happily collect Elven skulls and hopefully not spend too much gold holding them off.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
