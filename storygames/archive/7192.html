We needed a game with no prep and minimal rules; normally we meet up for Sorceror, but we didn't have two players available.<br/><br/>We had a lot of fun! The fun started pretty much right away. Archipelago directs you to draw a map to shape the world, and we all love maps. Following the text we drew 5 islands and named them: Grohn (home of the Pyratic College at Loam), Rimoov (haven of the Pyrotechnic Guild), Dock (a giant, ancient oil derrick covered in turf and farmland), Saturnia (the blasted island), and F\xfcndry (a volcano surrounded by D-day type iron X's). We went for a post-civilization future, with magic and old technology. According to the text, we divvied up control of the world: Jana owned Magic, Seth owned Technology, and I took Geography. <br/><br/>Seth played Rebar (Destiny: to curse his brother to end his people's plague, and something else I forget), a berskerker, hailed from F\xfcndry, and to leave his island he had to make a dark deal with a band of Sea Harpies, who gave him passage to the distant isle of Dock, in exchange for his fathering of the next generation of Sea Harpies.<br/><br/>Yes. After many fevered and sweaty hours, he completed his duty, now possessing the undying alliance of the Sea Harpies.<br/><br/>I played Captain Nathaniel Hawthorne (Destiny: to discover a forgotten power that would sink an island), graduate of the Piratic College at Loam, who set out from Grohn on his ship the S.S. Beagle to find lost  treasure in the northern reaches of Saturnia. Last we heard from him, he had temporarily encamped on the tiny neighboring isle of Boutros-Boutros (named for the legendary two-headed giant that lived there).<br/><br/>For some reason Jana's storyline captured all of our imaginations. Rwanda Griselda (Destiny: to enact revenge for her lost nephews), old mistress of the Pytrotechnic guild, through many mishaps lost control of the Pyrotechnic Guild (an invasion of Far Tounds, methanous kangaroo-like tusked dogs drawn to the smell of human flesh, a dragon passing by and attracted by a village (full of Pyrotechnic mages) burning to the ground, her nemesis Evitaxal started a new cadre of Pyrotechnic mages). We played and played this storyline, and never achieved the destiny, though we got close. (We ended with Rwanda and her twin sister Shirley Griselda poised to attack Evitaxal's camp, aided by Evitaxal's escaped gimp-slave Garrilous, once his most treasured man-toy).<br/><br/>I really liked the simplicity of the game: "Do it Differently, Please", "More Detail, Please", and "Draw a Card", we used each a lot, and they kept the game in line really well.<br/><br/>In Archipelago, in a "Draw a Card" conflict, you pick one player to narrate a negative outcome  (black card) for your character's conflict, and one to narrate a positive outcome (red). I found the other players always nominated me for the positive outcome, because the feared what I would narrate for the black. This made me laugh when I figured it out - a little bit of strategy in the game after all! I do admit to dreaming up the Sea Harpy conflict. I think that tipped them off.<br/><br/>Archipelago stands as a good example of "just enough" rules. I really like it. It won't create party play, but rather each player has a separate storyline that creates a kind of "walkabout" journey story, much like in LeGuin's A Wizard of Earthsea.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_160133">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160133/#Comment_160133" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-31T15:05:02+00:00" title="July 31, 2008  3:05PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome, Willem.  I'm jealous you got to play this before I did!<br/><br/>Did you run into any situations that needed an "owner" to make a decision?<br/><br/>How was the play with three people?  Did you feel like it would be better or worse with more or less players?<br/><br/>How long did the session last from start to finish?<br/><br/>I'm playing this game...and soon.  Maybe a double-feature with Until We Sink:)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_160140">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/willem" title="willem"><img alt="willem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/willem">willem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160140/#Comment_160140" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-31T15:26:02+00:00" title="July 31, 2008  3:26PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Chris! You know, we didn't really. We seemed to all get the nature of the setting enough that it didn't come up (no Vetos). We did a lot of "Do it Differently, Please" though.<br/><br/>Three people worked great. With less, you wouldn't really have someone else to narrate the other side of an outcome (positive/negative), and that would suck a little bit, I think (essentially the player would have to narrate the positive outcome for themselves). With more, I imagine the game would have run a lot more slowly. Four would work, but I can't imagine five players. Lots of new scene setting, lots of separate storylines...<br/><br/>From o prep to last scene, I would say four hours, maybe three and a half. I should underscore, all of that time we spent involved in the game, with minimal side-comments and tangents. We pretty much told a story for four straight hours. Pretty unusual for most story games I've played!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_160213">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160213/#Comment_160213" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-01T04:55:25+00:00" title="August  1, 2008  4:55AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I'm glad you had a good time! And yay for getting invested in other players' storylines!<br/><br/>I'm going to run an Archipelago campaign this fall with six players (including myself). It'll be interesting to see how that goes. I'm guessing more condensed play to get at the destiny points - but then again, we might go for slow play and not hurry the destinies.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
