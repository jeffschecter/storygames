The goal is to make an easy play game inspired by HG Well's Floor Games.<br/><br/>The problem I've been working on recently is integrating miniatures into story gaming where combat doesn't derail the game. <br/><br/>There are lots of war games. They can be great fun but also pretty long and complicated. If a story was happening all momentum is killed once the fighting starts. There are also lots of story games. Great fun, going from scene to scene at the speed of thought which leave using toys and terrain in the dust. I want something in between.<br/><br/>At the same time I like a bit of realism and want the combat results to make sense. <br/><br/>For the story part of the game I'm using Matrix game arguments. So before the game starts, players do a few turns of political actions, that flesh in what was going on before the minis arrived on the table. Once on the table the players make up stories and move figures. They explore, interact, make mistakes, backbite and otherwise role play. When they find out the enemy they fight.<br/><br/>Player interaction is very free form. A player makes up a story. Other players may offer up additions or changes. If the first player accepts them there is no roll. If they don't a roll determines which one happens. Players may continue offering additions as long as they like but if they fail they have to come up with a different story (so no "Yes I did." "No you didn't" loops). <br/><br/>When it comes to combat I want to use a present combat matrix so players don't have to come up with combat descriptions if they don't want to. Combat is depressingly consistent (see the Illiad) so unless you are a sadist, fighting descriptions get old real fast. Also I don't want people to have to be combat experts to play. <br/><br/>The way this matrix works is to look at the circumstances on the table when the fight is begun. The first item is the state on the table, the second item is a descriptive status. Further down the matrix the statuses show what next status shows up if the fight continues. The narrative shows who is the attacker so it is up to the players who gets hurt how, but the matrix defines the hurt.<br/><br/>1:1 odds = Engaged<br/>2:1 odds = Engaged and Pinned down (can't move)<br/>Engage = Wounded<br/>Flank attack = Wounded<br/>3:1 odds = Wounded or Routed<br/>Wounded = Defeated or Routed<br/>Surrounded = Defeated<br/><br/>A wound token is placed on the board when that comes up, otherwise the minis on the table show their state. The players next story show what these simple statuses mean. It should make combat fast but not too fast. Then play can get back to the human drama story, which I think is more interesting. <br/><br/>A lot more of the game is about managing hidden movement tokens and the players acting out objectives, like making a side succeed or fail, rather than running a character. <br/><br/>BTW the game this is for is a 1740's Chukchi vs Russian guerrilla war game. The Chukchis eventually won the war! I also want to use it for sci fi games.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442957/#Comment_442957" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-17T15:06:39+00:00" title="February 17, 2015  3:06PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 17, 2015 4:01PM by komradebob.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm. I've been thinking about something similar recently, as I want to get together with a buddy of mine and introduce his young'uns to minis gaming.<br/><br/>As just a general concept, I've personally been thinking about writing up an essay on "freeform" miniatures battles, and how to pair that with games that traditionally have nothing like rules/methods written into them for what we'd classically think of as "mini rules". And here I'm thinking of games that are truly thought of as verbal only, with possibly on extremely minimal amounts of written anything. Stuff like <b>Archipelago</b>, <b>Dungeon World</b>, even<b> Fiasco </b>possibly. There are some others, too. Cutting out all of the preliminary thoughts and commentary about collecting the medium and setting it all up, space considerations and so on, the hack for all of them boils down to this:<br/><br/><b><i>Use the toys, and show the action with the toys, in combination with the narration, and allow the toys to act as inspiration for the narration.<br/></i></b><br/><br/>Honestly, that's really kinda all of it, in essence.<br/><br/>Now, as to your specific game, let's try breaking it up into manageable bits. ( BTW, I don't know the war you're referencing, but I was pondering a French Resistance game, and it sounds like there may be parallel issues to figure out)<br/><br/>I guess, step one is to figure out what kind of game you're shooting for, and what your goals are, what the player fun is in your estimation, and then go back to pairing it all up with mechanics/methods.<br/><br/>1) Are you seeing this as something that is all played in one session, or over multiple sessions?<br/><br/>It's certainly easier to do it all as a one-shot, even if it involves hours of play. OTOH, if it's played over multiple sessions, you may have the ability to alter the table layout, mix of miniatures, and even the rules for each session, in a positive way. Basically, if it was to be played in multiple sessions, you'd be creating say five short games in the same setting, and related to one another, but you can focus on some different aspect in each one.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442958">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442958/#Comment_442958" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-17T15:27:27+00:00" title="February 17, 2015  3:27PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We'll talk once Lent kicks in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442959">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442959/#Comment_442959" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-17T16:18:53+00:00" title="February 17, 2015  4:18PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>2) How many players is this designed for?<br/></b>(If you end up designing multiple sessions, linked, this may vary from game to game) <br/><br/>This will impact your rules heavily.

It comes out when you're talking about this game. Roughly, these are the layers I see. In each one, you want to put some preliminaries in place, but then have players manipulate/play with/explore them, and each layer has implications for the others.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The historical context</span>: the big picture stuff. economics, culture, trade, politics, environment, agriculture, world politics, philosophies, historical trends.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The personal level</span>: Where individuals show/demonstrate ties to the stuff mentioned about, or exemplify it in some way. And also simple, human, personal interactions. Petty day to day stuff, the interactions n families, neighborhoods, jobs, romance.<br/><br/>And related to each, in a sense, the combatty stuff.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Small scale interpersonal drama/conflict/combat<br/></span><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Skirmish-y stuff, short but intense</span>. A raid, an ambush.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Battles: </span>We're focusing now on the relatively short interaction of bodies of troops, greater or lesser, over a relatively shirt amount of time. Personalities/characters are important, but less so. We might, occasionally, dip down to the previous level ( did we hold the crossroads and who died?) or even two layers lower ( an argument about strategy at the HQ! What happens as a result?)<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Campaigns:</span> The revolt is underway! What happens along the way? Who becomes a hero? What terrible, costly set backs are there? More importantly design-wise, how to dip back into those earlier, more focused layers above to keep a human interest element in play?<br/><br/><br/>With all f that good stuff going on, I'm going to recommend a split up of "phases" for those different levels, either during play or in different sessions.<br/><br/>Alternatively, make a "bathtub" game. I know you're an old wargamer, so you probably already know the term. For everybody else, it basically means you'll represent a greater conflict by making a very small parallel fictional conflict that has similar qualities.

At the same time, we want there to be twists and turns, because that helps develop the later fiction that flows out of it.<br/><br/>In a weird way, it doesn't matter who wins a conflict situation.<br/><br/>For me, I've been looking at the cards used in <b>Archipelago</b> and <b>Itras By</b>.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.vagrantworkshop.com/files/itras_by_chance_cards.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.vagrantworkshop.com/files/itras_by_chance_cards.pdf</a><br/><br/>I've been thinking of making more combatty versions of those for general use. Or maybe just using them as-is and doing on the spot interpretations. They're pretty broad already.<br/><br/>How I'd use them is as a substitute for when someone would demand a roll under the system you are suggesting. It's all freeplay until two players are at loggerheads about what happens. The least currently involved player draws, reads, and interprets.<br/><br/>Alternatively, or additionally, I've been looking at having a limited pool of rollable dice for combats. Say there are 10 dice available. Every time a roll-off comes up in a freeplay battle ( in context, a battle is part of a greater game, not the only thing going on), the dice are rolled, but then go away, thereby depleting the pool.<br/><br/>Players may choose to go to an Itras By card draw and interpretation instead of using dice. Any player may, X number of times during the course of a battle, take a die out of the pool, hold it up without saying anything, and simply discard it. That is a cue to people playing that they want the other players to hurry things along a bit. Combat/the battle is starting to become too much the focus.<br/><br/>When the dice pool is empty, someone (ref? otherplayer?) points this out and there needs to be a quick wrap for the battle scene or an agreement to a cliffhanger timeout on the battle, and the new focus needs to somehow be elsewhere for the next bit of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443002">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443002/#Comment_443002" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-18T20:19:33+00:00" title="February 18, 2015  8:19PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hope your Mardi Gras was fun.

Too cold.<br/><br/>Combining levels of play is definitely on my mind. <br/><br/>Been noticing in the last few months that my Matrix game rules have been orbiting around a few basic concepts. Since this is the case I hope it means I'm getting down to a complete game. Would really like to get out of rules writing and start running games as my primary creative focus. Here is what is emerging.<br/><br/>No matter what the game, the players are divided into two main groups. One group works towards the hero or heroes accomplishing their goal (either by doing well themselves or making the other side do poorly). The other team try's to make the heroes fail. Both try to make the story interesting. This takes it away from a regular competitive game because there if one side wins big it makes for a short boring game. Another player champions the bad guy/antagonist. And one player acts as the game host. Players no longer champion individual characters, they share the good guys and bad guys. <br/><br/>This must be what happened by default in Floor games. So no need to worry too much about who controls who.

No need to make it any more complex than that. The expert game host helps players do this. Once training to make up stories, anyone regardless of age or abilities can play.<br/><br/>Other players may step in and add to or alter what happens in that scene. If the first player accepts the offering, no dice are rolled. If they don't like it there is a roll. There are so many rolling schemes but today I'm thinking the first player rolls one 50/50 roll so rolling does not slow play down. <br/><br/>Players can keep adding to a scene as long as they want. The only limit is that if you lose a roll, you may not repeat that action. Come up with something else or accept defeat.<br/><br/>This does away with turn order and rule imposed order. Action just happens, figures get moved and the game flows. <br/><br/>The game host should jump in at some point and end a scene. The next player around the table then starts the next scene. If in additions, players start jumping away from the scene in their additions it is a cue to start a new scene.<br/><br/>The game host may jump in with plot suggestions/problems to help guide play but the game is largely self guided.<br/><br/>Those are the basic mechanics. Pretty consistent for the last four years.

My real hope is to run Sci Fi games. I just love small groups of soldiers and investigators doing bug hunts.<br/><br/>The game is essentially a mystery.<br/><br/>The protagonists move onto the terrain boards with all their people in the open. The antagonist may start with units on board or have a number of hidden move counters.<br/><br/>The bad guy counters are not defined at the start of play. Players define who they are in the stories they tell. Mechanically though the players know that two hidden move tokens may be placed on board per unit or hidden move token. The means ambushes may develop wherever the players make them.<br/><br/>In the first part of the tactical game is scouting out and defining what these are is what sets up the battlefield. <br/><br/>When units get close together (I say one hand span so I don't need rules on the table. Then the rigid combat matrix comes into play. It saves the players from having to make detail (repetitive) combat descriptions. It also doesn't let combat ruin the flow of the story. <br/><br/>My hope is that players will make fun story actions rather than dive into the minutiae of combat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443006/#Comment_443006" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-18T20:56:31+00:00" title="February 18, 2015  8:56PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That is the thinking for now.

Is there a way to officialize those?<br/>Maybe name them and give those "roles" to certain players?<br/><br/>Like, say, someone<i> has to </i>suggest/create problems and obstacles, otherwise, no fun, right? Officialize the role and give both rights and duties to it. Likewise, the other roles that need to be filled. Then you can decide whether those roles packages stay with a certain player, or move around in some fashion, and how that happens.<br/><br/>As for that 50/50 roll you talked about, I'm coming around to the PoV that one-shot games actually may benefit most of all from simple mechanics. After all, there will be plenty of complexity for the occasion simply in the developing story, and plenty of challenge for players simply in seeing if they can follow up on whatever the outcome of the roll was, the challenge that folks doing improve have when someone throws in a new element for their character to deal with.<br/><br/>Since we've been talking about all of this in terms of a guerilla war against the Russians in the 1700s, with miniatures, would you be alright talking about the toys and the layout a bit? It may be important to figuring out the other stuff.<br/><br/>Also, what is your sweetspot for number of players for this?<br/><br/>I know that ultimately, you want to use these concepts for broader application. Let's start with that one scenario-game, and see where it goes, then come back to the idea of broader application.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443027">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443027/#Comment_443027" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-20T03:00:08+00:00" title="February 20, 2015  3:00AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd like to have up to eight players but it should work for four.<br/><br/>Been thinking a lot about the terrain.

Politics and tactical.<br/><br/>The political level is where the big story happens. So in the play test we did three political stories (one player saying an action with as many additions as we wanted). We determined that the over all Russian commander was there because of a sex scandal back in St Petersburg. That didn't turn out to be important. Next up we learned that the local captain was having an affair with the wife of a merchant. The merchant then beat his wife in response because fighting the captain would mean dying in a duel. Fortunately the captain then intervened and beat the merchant for being such a swine. The cossacks saw this and approved of their commander being so strong. Of course they didn't care about the women - 18th century sexism and military culture. <br/><br/>These free flowing story elements made the Russian characters real.<br/><br/>On the Chukchi side we determined that the chief's son had been tortured and killed by the Russian but that the tribe was divided on what to do about it. They had a fragile consensus to fight - which fell apart in the tactical game.<br/><br/>In the tactical game players continued to offer political actions but also troop moves, scouting out hidden move tokens and eventually combat. <br/><br/>I tried to be clever with the Chukchis and came out to talk with the captain, to try and lure him into an ambush. Unfortunately it didn't work - it REALLY didn't work and my guys were betrayed first. Both the chief and shaman were killed. And we lost half of our reindeer. It was a bad day.<br/><br/>+++++<br/><br/>So about individual characters. We talked about characters and located the characters in specific stands (two figs per stand for Russians - one for Chukchis). But the figures are not individual.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443068/#Comment_443068" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-21T13:55:31+00:00" title="February 21, 2015  1:55PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm.<br/><br/>It sounds like you already have most of what you're looking for, so is <i>just</i> that the tactical stuff happens and then eats up all of the focus and time?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443073">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443073/#Comment_443073" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-21T18:53:34+00:00" title="February 21, 2015  6:53PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            These are just thoughts.

The trouble with simple systems it they can sometimes have gaping holes that the author just can't see. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Here is the scenario info I used for the first play test. <br/><br/>Chukchi Scenario<br/><br/>The Russians<br/><br/><br/>Court Orlov: You we sent to command here as a punishment. If you are ever to return to St Petersburg you must extract maximum tribute from the reindeer herders. Filthy savages!<br/><br/><br/>Captain Dmitri: You are the real leader of the Cossack garrison. You are here for the long haul. You have to survive your leader's tyranny, the 11 month winters, and the fiercely independent Chukchis. Keep your men safe. There are very few of you and help won't arrive for six months or more if things go wrong.<br/><br/><br/>Pavel Andreavich: You are a merchant. You sell goods for furs but you will accept anything in trade that is valuable. The soldiers have to protect you but they are all thieving swine.<br/><br/><br/>Rabbi Grossman: You are an exile, and a Jew in a land of Christians. Good luck surviving this!<br/><br/><br/>Forces<br/><br/>1 stand of Tartar cavalry<br/>4 stands of Cossack infantry<br/>2 stand of merchants and civilians<br/>2 cannon stationed at your fort<br/><br/><br/>The Chukchis<br/><br/><br/>Hetman Oban: At times you have had good relations with the Russians, then three years ago they captured your son when he was raiding the camp. They tortured him and fed him to the dogs. These are not people they are wolves.<br/><br/><br/>Barbak the Hunter: You are a hunter of great repute. Bear, wolves, walrus, all have fallen under your blows. Now you hunt Russians.<br/><br/><br/>Guban the Shaman: You divine the future by reading the signs of nature. The Russians do not live in balance. They drive men mad with drink. They enslave men with their God. Keep the people true to their ancestors. That may means war.<br/><br/><br/>Tutan the Coward: You are not a brave man. You are not strong like Oban, clever like Bardak, or holy like Guban. You like the Russian alcohol. How can you get more?<br/><br/><br/>The Forces<br/><br/>2 stands of Reindeer riding scouts<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sent from my iPad<br/><br/><br/>And here are the rules sheet I'll use in the play test tonight.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Guerilla War game rules <br/><br/>2-24-15<br/><br/>Roles: Triumph, Trouble, Realist (This is the guiding principle for that player- people are not running characters, instead they are running aspects.)<br/><br/>Political actions followed by a tactical game<br/><br/>Hidden movement: Any unit, blank token or terrain feature on the board may have hidden enemy units. A token may reveal one real unit or two blank tokens. Only real units may fight but hidden political actions may happen at any of these locations.<br/><br/>Movement: Move one hand span. Combat range is also one hand span. Move units as you speak.<br/><br/>One player starts a scene by picking a character/unit and saying what happens. Move units as you speak.<br/><br/>Other players may jump in and add to or change the scene. If everyone accepts it it happens. If anyone objects they roll a d6. On a roll of 4-6 the action fails. Players may continue adding to the scene as long as they like but additions that are rolled out do not happen. Find another way or accept defeat.<br/><br/>When players try to say things happen anywhere else, that ends the scene and starts a new scene. Move units that were already in motion. <br/><br/>When stories include combat the players may describe it but the results from a given turn are based on the units present and how the situation corresponds to the combat matrix.<br/><br/>Combat Matrix<br/><br/>1-1\t: Engage <br/>Engage : Wound (place a wound token on the board next to the units engaged)<br/>Wound : Defeat or Rout<br/>Defeated : Surrender or Annihilate if they refuse<br/>Rout : Disperse<br/><br/>2-1 : Pin down (engaged and can\u2019t move)<br/>Pinned down : Wound<br/><br/>3-1 : Wound or Rout<br/><br/>Ambush : Wound<br/><br/>Flank : Wound<br/><br/>Surrounded : Defeat<br/><br/><br/><br/>The scenario will be a little different. The Russians get no Tartar cavalry. Instead they get two Chukchi scouts (who like alcohol enough to work for the enemy to get it). The Chukchis get only one armored unit (the chief). <br/><br/>I'll let you know who the session goes.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443174">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443174/#Comment_443174" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-24T14:42:02+00:00" title="February 24, 2015  2:42PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your AWI scenario sounds interesting.

It clears up what the players are working for, and who rolls dice when. I'll need to test it to see if they work, but it sounds simple enough But doesn't it always!)<br/><br/><br/>New Procedures<br/><br/><br/>One player is the host. They assign roles to the players and lay out the game board. They also keep the game running smoothly by encouraging the players.<br/><br/>Roles tell the players what they need to do in the game. The two roles are "Success" and "Trouble". Success players secretly pick a side and work to make that side succeed. Success players may work against one another. Trouble players work to cause trouble. They point out how plans don't work and unexpected thing arise. The host's role is to keep things reasonable and fun.<br/><br/>The host picks who starts  a scene. The player then points to a location or character and says what happens. Move figures as you speak.<br/><br/>Other players may then jump in to add to or change what happens.<br/><br/>If you don't like what a player adds, tell them to roll for it. They roll 2d6, if they roll 8+ then their action happens. If not, it doesn't happen and will not happen in this scene. If you thing someone will demand you roll, you can choose to roll for your own action right after you make it. Roll 2d6, on a roll of 7+ your action happens.<br/><br/>Players may continue to add to a scene as long as they like but the host may stop this and ask someone else to start a new scene.<br/><br/>Players move figures as they make up stories but figures also move at the beginning of every new scene.<br/><br/>The host may suggest a problem that needs to be solved at any time. If the players solve the problems through their actions, a coherent story will emerge.<br/><br/>When players say a fight begins consult the combat matrix to see what the outcome is. This slows down combat a little and makes it less decisive.<br/><br/>1-1 : Engage the enemy<br/>Engage : Wound<br/>Wound : Defeat or Rout<br/>Defeated : Surrender or Annihilate if they refuse<br/>Rout : Disperce<br/><br/>2-1 : Pin down, can't move<br/>Pin down : Wound<br/><br/>3-1 : Wound or Rout<br/><br/>Ambush : Wound<br/>Flank : Wound<br/>Surround : Defeat                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443316">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443316/#Comment_443316" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-26T13:29:26+00:00" title="February 26, 2015  1:29PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm definitely seeing the MG looking a lot more like Paddy Griffith's Mugger game. But it is more a conversation between the players than a conversation with the referee. I like the idea behind the World games - a conversation between players and GM. I know people think the GM rules and principles limit the GM but I don't think they do. World GMs are as powerful as old D+D GMs of years ago. By picking what technique to use next you are Oz the amazing and powerful. When running it I feel like a total puppet master.<br/><br/>With the MG's I feel powerful as host but not all powerful. It is a much more equal conversation. <br/><br/>BTW I think a video or blog is a much better way to go.

Lots of great refinement going on there-congrats!<br/><br/>A few thoughts, in no particular order...<br/><br/><b>The Host</b><br/>I've thought a ton about a similar kind of issue. Or put another way, I've thought a ton about splitting up the classic GM/Ref participant-role. You've nailed one of them, and I also used the term "The Host". I think it's a good one; this activity<i> should</i> be a bit like a party.<br/><br/>Here are some broken down, atomic parts of it all:<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The host ( small-H): </span>The person who is actually holding and organizing the event and making it pleasant, and inviting everyone. Actually, some of these duties could be broken down further.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The scenario designer/tool picker/fiction presenter/toy collection chooser</span>: This too could be broken up further and spread around<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>The teacher/vibe keeper/referee:</b></span> This could be separate from the other bits, and is most what the participant-role is <b>during</b> play. One thing you might try is something I've seen in other GM-less designs, or in designs with high amounts of player input: <b>Bounce the responsibility for judgments back at the other participants, then only act as a confirmer of group decisions or as a tie-breaker vote.</b><br/><br/>"Should we roll now?"<br/>"Maybe. What does everyone else think?"<br/><br/>You know all of the sorts of questions I'm talking about. <i>Should we end the scene there? Do the units make contact? Should we get more/less detailed?</i><br/><br/>I think for that, the referee/Host can lead by example, bouncing  judgments back where possible, hopefully getting the concept back to the players so they start doing it on their own. You ( the Host) can still offer informed decisions and principled ones, and use knowledge of the setting to guide things a bit, but ultimately pass those things off. Like a Momma Cat teaching the kittens to hunt.<br/><br/>Now, it may not ever stick as a concept, or only stick late in a game, especially with one-offs or changing groups of players, but you've tried!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443327">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443327/#Comment_443327" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-26T14:30:17+00:00" title="February 26, 2015  2:30PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Of winning, losing, debriefs, and recognition</b><br/><br/>The in-fiction wins/losses<br/>Characters and factions in the fiction have wins and losses. In a really traditional, toy soldier wargame, it's pretty straight forward, and frankly often a bit boring. Side A wiped out Side B, or whatever.<br/><br/>Notably, history books or documentaries don't really work like that. there's often an epilogue of some sort that talks about <i>What Came After</i>. How did this conflict/battle just discussed fit into a greater river of history? What became of the people involved? What costs were paid? Was this a victory for Side A that led to greater victories or was it a brief moment of glory in a lost war?<br/><br/>Often, there is a discussion of all the partial victories and costs of the conflict.<br/><br/>With the stuff I've been puttering with, this is all couched in terms of audience reaction to the "film" ( the game played and the story created) upon release.<br/><br/>I think you could feasibly add something like that to your game also, in the forms of questions to be answered by participants free-form style, post-game.<br/><br/>It hopefully has some of the following effects:<br/>1) Can act as a decompression phase for players who really did get wrapped up in advocating for a particular faction that lost. Yes, it does mean they were in a bit of a more traditional wargamer mindset than what you're shooting for with your game, but may act as a bit of a salve to frustrations at the cruelty of fate and uncooperative dice rolls.<br/><br/>2) For the designer, it may give a cue for follow up game ideas and scenarios. Someone starts talking about how Sgt Mifflin survived and went on to win glory in the Arcturus Campaign, despite his poor leadership at the Centauri Rim Station Debacle-- Dood! You know what the next game is about immediately!<br/><br/>3) It starts players incorporating one another's ideas in a greater narrative (hopefully), and ties it all back to the initial info you gave them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443328">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443328/#Comment_443328" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-26T14:43:17+00:00" title="February 26, 2015  2:43PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Out of fiction win, and mutual admiration love-fest</b><br/><br/>I was a kid in the 1970s.

Your guests can find and play those any old time.<br/><br/>My thought: give lots of awards and in different categories, make sure everyone gets some, and pawn the whole issue off on the players themselves.<br/><br/>Like when you were a kid in school on Valentines' Day: If you're going to give cards, everyone in the classroom gets one ( but you, the individual, decides who gets which <i>specific</i> card from you).<br/><br/>The Designer just decides what the  Gamer-Nerd Valentine cards are and what they say, presumably thematic either to the game overall, or the specific scenario, or both. Give each player a stack of them, more categories than other players ( if there are four participants, maybe 6 different cards per player), and each player has to give each other player one. Discard unused cards. Do it openly, or secretly as seems appropriate.<br/><br/>And, only then, if really, absolutely necessary, have the players themselves vote on another player as MVP, as a holistic score, based on their own criteria for it.<br/><br/>Why such a weird approach? <br/><br/>Well, it is different than expected, and may, hopefully, encourage more fiction creation and less player stress on typical wargame win conditions.<br/><br/>It's also feedback of a positive sort.<br/><br/>It helps the host think about future combinations of players.<br/><br/>It's peer review.

Seen how often people trash "Once upon a time" for not being about winning a losing. Thought why not just start from word go saying no one wins, no one loses, everyone wins if the story is fun. <br/><br/>But the inclusion of giving awards to players for cool play sounds fun. <br/><br/>Sounds like what I've seen in LARPS. At least the few I've played in. They took time to express appreciation for what players did. I could see having everyone do this in a round robin. <br/><br/>Also I can see handing out cards at conventions that have a hamster trophy on them. People would love that and probably keep them for years. It would be so inexpensive for me to make and I can do the art work and get them printed in China. My web page info could be slipped in on the back. Sneaky me. <br/><br/><br/><br/>I like the host term to. They still have power. I'm giving them a complete veto power along with the power to make up problems for the players to solve, but beyond that they players are nearly as powerful.<br/><br/>By passing all decisions about rolls onto the players, the host steps out of the main job of the GM. "The person who puts the official stamp on rolls." I'm thinking about RPG sessions of old where I had to get the GM's attention to see that I'd made an official roll. This might put the rolling just between the players. <br/><br/><br/><br/>I did a quick look at the clunkiness of older MG rules. There was some serious gear grinding going on. This looks simpler. I've long looked for the magic formula of rules. That system that is so simple and easy that anyone can do it. I so much want it so I can give up rules writing. Or at least that is what I keep telling myself.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443344/#Comment_443344" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-26T15:40:54+00:00" title="February 26, 2015  3:40PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't doubt the value of the MVP award.

And spread the love around. Everyone ends up contributing something to an enjoyable game.<br/><br/>Is there such a thing as losing in this context? Well, maybe. Let's say you get your "valentines" and look them over. You really, really wanted to get ones that said "Historical Expert", and you've been trying really hard all session to throw in tidbits you know about the period ( or guessed from any intro material presented/handed out).<br/><br/>There were three other players, and you only got one<i> Historical Expert </i>valentine! Some other player ends up with two <i>Historical Expert</i> valentines!!!!<br/><br/>Bummer.<br/><br/>I mean, sure, you got a <i>Best Character Portrayal </i>valentine and a <i>Sneakiest Tactical Moment</i> valentine. But, well, you did shoot for some goals that you made yourself, and someone else ended up as the Pretty Party Princess of <i>Historical Experts</i>!<br/><br/>Does being considered by your peers to be well-rounded (instead of clearly superior in a single category) count as a loss?<br/><br/>Maybe.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443391/#Comment_443391" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-26T22:36:22+00:00" title="February 26, 2015 10:36PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right now, I've been working on a few different, related concepts for story-games+minis.<br/><br/><b>The movie game</b><br/>Lots of preliminary Lonely Fun for the designer. Essentially, you ( Designer Hat You) get to come up with a bunch of cool toys and a layout. For fiction, you get to declare essentially the overall, broad shape of the thing and offer lots of tidbits about <i>possible</i> characters (and some bits about personality and motivations), events, scene-types, sub-plots, and perhaps add on some kind of general outline. The fiction surrounding the game is that the players are the creative development team for a film and the employer/studio-head is the type of guy that hands off all sorts of concepts to you collectively and expects you to create the thing from that.<br/><br/>Meant to be played in scenes ( representing the major scenes. Unseen helpers will fill in the minor stuff, and connecting plot sinews on their own), with only a few people. The toys are a tool, representing studio resources like pools of extras, main characters, and backlots/sound studios for shooting.<br/><br/><b>The Braunstein</b> ( with lightweight competition)<br/>Meant for multiple players, and competitive. A bit like a parlour LARP, but with minis. Basically, the kind of stuff Howard Whitehouse runs at conventions with as many as 2 dozen players.<br/><br/>For a smaller number of players, a bit like ( apparently) his <i>Mad Dogs with Guns </i>games run, or his <i>Outlaws of Sherwood </i>games. Only uses part of an overall layout, with miniature, short, competitive vignettes/skirmishes, quickly resolved, creating an overall series of events.<br/><br/><b>The History Book about a conflict game</b><br/>A bit more like what we've been talking about and somewhere between the other two. In a sense, simulating the feel of reading a history book. Preliminaries about the overall situation, creation of backgrounds and personal issues of characters involved, and a nod to surrounding tactical issues impacted by higher level concerns. Players have a body of knowledge and some ability to choose which of those surrounding issues are relevant to this particular and specific skirmish/battle. Eventually narrows down towards a more traditional sort of tabletop toy soldier game play phase, but players <b>do not</b> know, until that phase is reached, what faction they will advocate for ( who am I going to play?). Hopefully this last point gets them to create lopsided victory conditions and even lopsided battles in a way they wouldn't be inclined to if they knew from the outset who they will play. Maybe they all end up playing on one side as different characters, with problems even in that!<br/><br/>We might actually be able to achieve a Cowpens or Oriskany or similar, and that to me would be a big check in the win column, design-wise, for me! Or even just a clash and withdrawal in good order, as players take into account broader issues at stake than just the immediate conflict.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443478">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443478/#Comment_443478" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-28T18:11:42+00:00" title="February 28, 2015  6:11PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Someday I need to get back East to Historicon. It is drivable from here. I used to love playing in Howard's games in Nashville. Now that he's in NYC I never see him. Sigh.<br/><br/>In thinking more about the proceedures above (having two types of roll, one 7+ the older 8+) it makes no since. Why have two ways to do a roll that does exactly the same thing (and done by two different people). No one would know who should roll. Pointless complication. So why not one roll? This would make MGs look like this:<br/><br/>One player starts a scene.<br/>Other players add to it or change bit. <br/>Any one can ask a player to roll 7+ on 2d6 to succeed.<br/><br/>So players mainly add to stories with no rolls and rolls only come up when people want them to. "Roll!" Which comes up because a player doesn't like it. So rolls and emotion go hand in hand. <br/><br/>The down side of this is that rolls are all about saying "No" and are not contests between two different versions of events. But it is so simple and intuitive. Which is its other problem, it is too simple. I really need to experiment with this.<br/><br/>Got my Chukchi minis finished today. Now I need to make the terrain mat. Terri starts work on Monday so we'll be financially solvent again.

It's always how it works.<br/><br/>2) You are at some level looking only at an atomic part of your overall actual game and thinking it's too simple.<br/><br/>It's a bit like the "3 foot rule" and miniatures painting.<br/><br/>Yes, you know that when you painted that one miniature, the eyes turned out crappy. And it bothers you, because you know it's wrong. OTOH, on the table, in the game, that miniature is going to be viewed from a minimum of 3 feet away and probably is going to be surrounded by anywhere from a dozen to several hundred miniatures, plus all of the terrain. No one will notice.<br/><br/>A "too simple" rule/mechanic is like that too.<br/><br/>That thing will be used surrounded by so much imaginative input by multiple players in an unfolding series of events, surrounded by the physical goodies and non-game social interactions that no one will notice that it's too simple. Only someone sitting at home, reading, but not playing, will notice it is too simple.<br/><br/>Just like only someone holding up that miniature a foot from their face will notice the eyes are wrong. And if they're holding it there, they aren't gaming with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443551">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443551/#Comment_443551" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-02T14:20:05+00:00" title="March  2, 2015  2:20PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As for the saying "No" part: use Corporate Speak on the them- <i>Don't just come with a problem, come with a solution!</i><br/><br/>(I hate Corporate-Speak )<br/><br/>So, anyone can call for a roll, but part of that call requires them to offer an alternative that has some significant difference from what is already being said.

These are the ones I'll use for Sherlock Holmes games.<br/><br/>Alternate rules 3/8/15<br/><br/>All the player needs to know<br/><br/>Pick a character and say what happens in the scene. Move characters as you speak.<br/>Go around the table adding to the story. Connect what you say to what's happened before.<br/>Interrupt at any time to add to or change a player's scene. It automatically happens unless another player asks you to roll for it. You need to roll 7+ on 2d6 to win. Actions that fail will not happen in this scene<br/>Players may keep on adding to a scene as long as they wish.<br/><br/><br/>One player is the host. Their job is to keep the game moving and help new players learn the rules. They also help players out when they can't think of an action. They manage the following rules.<br/><br/>1. The host picks the characters and locations for the game. Lay them on a table. The host introduces the scenario. The host assigns roles to players based on the scenario. <br/><br/>2. Part of the players get the "Success" role. They work to make the heroes succeed. At least one player gets the "Trouble" role. They cause the heroes trouble by making their plans fail and by making the antagonists plans succeed. All the players try to make the story interesting and entertaining. The host acts as "The Voice of Reason." <br/><br/>3. The host starts the game by pointing out a problem that needs to be solved. The host may suggest new problems at any time. As the players solve problems a coherent story happens. The host may use a pre-written list of problems or make them up as they go along. <br/><br/>4. The host starts play by picking a character and saying what happens in the scene. Move characters as you speak. Make a point of saying what ALL the characters do in the scene. Players describe everything that happens, not just what a single character does. So don't just say what a character does, say what results from that move! Think cause and effect. <br/><br/>5. The host demonstrates the rules rather than tells them. Players learn fastest by doing. Get the game going immediately rather than spend time teaching the rules.<br/><br/>6. Play goes to the left around the table. Each player creates their own scene. Bit by bit a story emerges based on what the players say. Nothing happens in the game except what the players say. <br/><br/>7. Players may interrupt at any time to add to or change another player's scene. They say what they want to happen. This action automatically happens unless another player asks them to roll for it. If the player rolls 7+ on 2d6 their action happens. Failed actions do not happen and may not be tried again in that scene. Players may keep adding to scenes as long as they like. The host decides if later action are too close to failed actions. <br/><br/>8. The hosts remembers who goes next after all the additions are done.<br/><br/>9. The host should jump in with an addition the first time around the table to demonstrate the rule. They should also ask another player to roll for an action soon after players start adding.The host manages all the other rules of the game.<br/><br/>10. The trouble players cause trouble with their additions and changes. The host may need to give them more encouragement at the beginning of the game because this requires a lot of creativity. The player needs to mess things up to give the game challenge but they don't need to mess up everything. Let things you like happen. Just make certain to complicate things often enough to keep things from being too easy.<br/><br/>11. The host may suggest a new problem at any time. A problem is usually some plot point that moves the story along. If the players act on the suggestion, a coherent plot driven story will emerge. The host may read problems off of a prewritten problem list or make them up based on what the players are doing. It is up to the players as to what they do with the problems. <br/><br/>12. Players may opt to champion a character. They do this by trying to make their character central to the story. Characters championed by players may not die until the last problem begins. The host needs to clearly say which problem is the last problem so the players know that the blood bath may begin. After resolving that scene the players go around the table one last time to tie up loose ends. They do this by saying what happens to a character after the game or clearing up lose plot points. <br/><br/>12. Throughout the game the host should be helpful and encouraging to the players, especially new players. The host keeps the game moving by reminding the next player that it is their turn. They say "You're up!" to get a player to make up a scene and "Any additions or changes?" to get players to do that. And "Any more?" To find out when to end the scene. <br/><br/>13. The host is the voice of reason. They should make changes to all unreasonable actions by the players. The host may also veto outright socially unacceptable actions. Use this power sparingly! The also decides when to end scenes if they don't naturally peter out. For the most part the host has the same amount of power as the other players. The visible exception is when the host suggests problems. The host can have a huge influence on the game by the problems they suggest. A good host can guide games to maximum fun with a few well placed problems.<br/><br/>14. The host should keep a record of the actions in the game. A few notes jotted down will do. Other players are allowed to refer to this event map as needed. <br/><br/>15. Once the last problem is resolved, play goes around the table one last time to tie up loose ends. Players make a statement that settles an unresolved point, or says what happens to a character after the story ends. Players may volunteer to go first or the host may pick. The player who goes last has the final say in the game.<br/><br/>16. Optional conflict rule: When a player makes a story that causes a conflict between two players or causes trouble for a number of players, the host  may ask other players to make an argument about why a character is not affected by the harm. If the player rolls 7+ on 2d6 the character is not hurt. <br/><br/>The host's rules<br/><br/>Lay out the game and describe the scenario to the players.<br/>Assign players roles in the game: success or trouble.

The one roll rule works. <br/><br/>We called on one another to roll whenever we liked and it worked smoothly. It came up when we wanted it to - mainly when we were being partisan.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=956738304346393&amp;set=a.745302342156658.1073741826.100000306983096&amp;type=1&amp;theater"/><br/><br/>A Russian patrol was out collecting tribute from Chukchi tribes. It is winter (11 months of the year in that part of the world) so I used my newly made white world terrain mat, with hill bits underneath the cloth. They spotted a group of armed Chukchis on a hill, looking like they were going to make a stand. The Russians were re-enforced so their stands represented twice the number of troops shown. They made straight towards the Chukchis. Meanwhile, hidden movement tokens (representing reindeer herds) moved up on them. The Russians spotted the trap and formed square. The Chukchis rushed them and an intense battle broke out. Eventually the Russian fire power overwhelmed the Chukchis who then fled. The Russians failed to get any tribute though so the Captain was in hot water with his commander. <br/><br/>The holes in the rules emerged when we got into the fire fight. The  rules say that actions that miss a roll can't happen in a scene - but the definition of when scenes ended completely fell apart. It all blended together. Also to question was how and when to use the combat matrix. <br/><br/>Another rule that worked was actually a politeness recommendation. Players were to allow others to make then next addition rather than to make one addition after another. This effortlessly broke us up into turns. <br/><br/>The game was fun and worked. <br/><br/>I'm thinking of putting a colored stone on the table and defining a scene as being everything in a move radius around the stone. The scene lasts as long as the stone is there. You have to move it elsewhere to start a new scene. Then it can go back to the first place.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443915/#Comment_443915" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-11T13:53:31+00:00" title="March 11, 2015  1:53PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=956738304346393&amp;set=a.745302342156658.1073741826.100000306983096&amp;type=1&amp;theater" rel="nofollow">Here is a link to the picture.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443917/#Comment_443917" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-11T14:42:07+00:00" title="March 11, 2015  2:42PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your scene stone diameter idea is one that I had considered at one point as well. I bought a film crew from Bob Murch Pulp figures line instead, to use to form a square around the scene.<br/><br/> haven't quite come up with absolute rules for it's use however. Right now,  I think I want it to be an obvious boundary, but things can also be "just outside the scene". That's more for when you want to show impending danger, like reinforcements coming, but not quite there yet ( so say, sitting up to 6" [28mm scale minis] outside of the boundary created).<br/><br/>I like the core idea, however! Which means I'm planning to steal it! When the marker moves, the scene ends. Characters need to "stay in the shot", so to speak. That's brilliant, combining the physical stuff and the fictional events.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443918/#Comment_443918" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-11T14:52:39+00:00" title="March 11, 2015  2:52PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The mat looks great, btw.

(Now that I think of it I may use a chess pawn for ease of grabbing). A player can reach out a grab the pawn and place it at another location to start a new scene. If it isn't moved, the scene hasn't ended , and players can not try failed actions again. <br/><br/>I have TV news crew figures but want to use them as characters rather than as admin counters. And of course they would not fit in the 1740's!<br/><br/>The terrain field needs a bit more kipple but it is getting there. Easy to transport. I'll be making up desert world and green world mats soon. I like desert world for Sci Fi games.

It worked to keep thing focused. Used a polished rock but I'd like to try out a chess piece. <br/><br/>The games are building on one another. The Russians have won two major actions and not lost the other games so this time I tried out a peace game. The merchant unit, a Cossack guard and a Chukchi guide went out on a trading trip. The Chukchis had a conflict over whether to ambush or talk to the Russians. Peace won, so the Shaman Guban killed a reindeer and cooked it for a feast. The Shaman prevented his son from poisoning the Cossacks, but unfortunately a rival band's scout stole this meat and poisoned some of his people. Then decided it was evil magic. A revenge feud will happen. Divide and conquer. <br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444327">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444327/#Comment_444327" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-20T01:26:12+00:00" title="March 20, 2015  1:26AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm glad you tried out the peace variant.
