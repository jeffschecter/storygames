The "core" mechanic of 2d6+stat versus static difficulties produces a desperate, urgent feeling. And most of the GM advice given - such as to "look through crosshairs" at NPCs - is as much of the system as the die mechanic. The choice and number of stats is important - more stats or the wrong stats can push the game off a cliff.<br/><br/>Things that can be messed with (in my opinion):<br/><br/>The 6- bracket can be mechanized (but haven't seen it.)<br/>Advances. Can be replaced with a different incentive to use highlighted stats (but haven't seen it.)<br/>HX. Can be augmented or swapped out with another inter-party mechanic (and frequently is.)<br/>The moves and playsets can be dropped, changed, or tweaked to fit another setting (and this is what most people think of when they say AW hack.)<br/><br/>However, I have to emphasize that I really don't agree that AW is a generic game-building platform. It's a great system for games <i>like Apocalypse World</i> - where there are dire situations, with characters who grudgingly get along, who frequently fail and suffer harshly for it. It would make a fine platform for something like <i>Watchmen</i>, or <i>Dracula</i>, or something set in the Vietnam War. <br/><br/>For me, AW is half being screwed by circumstances, and half things snowballing out of control. (And let me be clear - that's what I love about the game.) Hacks that don't need those things are not benefiting from AW. Some hacks do something else, and I've found the things they do are enjoyable in their own right: Dungeon World and Monsterhearts both do wonderful things. But to me, AW isn't helping. Now, I've had a lot of good games of both because their creators have poured lots of effort into making the game do what they want. I just think that the only thing they get out of being an AW hack is that people know how to play AW. It's not about the system qua system.<br/><br/>Also, just my two cents; I realize I'm not with the internet on this one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383254">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383254/#Comment_383254" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-24T16:10:34+00:00" title="June 24, 2012  4:10PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 24, 2012 4:12PM by johnzo.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Moves are powerful stuff for creating a very specific play style.

This is a complete game by itself and is the "secret" engine that AW and its derivatives run on, even in cases where the MC actually rolls dice (which is conceivable in some hacks, right?). This core system is itself hackable because all those things (agendas, principles, etc.) are explicitly laid out, so people can easily modify them for a game that requires different things from the GM.<br/><br/>Everything else in AW builds off this modifiable core. I think I would stop recognizing something as inspired by AW if it I could no longer see clear signs of this core principled freeform system operating underneath everything else.<br/><br/>Player moves are probably the other key building block of AW and its hacks. While they are mostly triggered by events in the fiction and seem to be things the players do, there's a fair amount of obfuscation happening beneath the surface, obscuring how they actually work, which can make it hard to write custom moves unless you have a lot of experience and intuitively "get" how the system works. Some player moves are triggered by social/OOC things, after all (at the beginning of a session, when there's some downtime, etc.). Also, most player moves contain MC moves inside of them. They are the specific means for one or more players to dialog with the MC about a particular circumstance, until what's happened has become clear. An obvious example is the "read a person" or "open your brain" information moves, where the players ask questions of the MC (which mirrors the MC guidance to ask questions of the players), but most moves are clearer when viewed this way. Even the moves where the player just makes something happen ("An arresting skinner" always drives people crazy) are part of the dialog, because the MC has to play their NPCs and have them react appropriately for the move to mean anything at all.<br/><br/>Likewise, if a hack was missing these "dialog points" between players and the GM, I think it would stop feeling like AW to me. The "dialog points" happen somewhat in the core freeform system by itself -- partially through the MC constantly reaffirming the dialog-nature of play by asking "What do you do?" -- but player moves really focus this.<br/><br/>Finally, the differentiation between core moves and other moves seems pretty critical to AW hacks.  Even Murderous Ghosts has "core loops," which work somewhat differently but are based on the same idea. The brilliant and infinitely hackable part about moves is that the core, optional, and peripheral moves all operate based on the same rules and fall into similar types.  There's the simple 10+/7-9/fail breakdown, there's picking things from lists, there's offering choices, and dozens of other common move formats. But -- because they operate similarly -- you can easily swap out core and peripheral moves to make different types of AW-inspired games. For example, it's easy to imagine a game about crazy psychics on the run (something like PSI*RUN), where one or more of the Brainer moves are core moves instead of being limited to a particular character type. So hacks are constantly shifting moves from the core to the periphery and vice-versa. Whatever game you want to hack out of AW, there's probably some inspiration for your core moves in <i>some move somewhere</i>, even if you have to look in Dungeon World or Monsterhearts or something else. And as the stable of AW-derived games increases, there's a bigger and bigger pool of moves to serve as inspiration for other hacks.<br/><br/>The differentiation-but-identical-structure between core and non-core moves isn't as crucial to Apocalypse World as the others. Honestly, core moves have a traditional-but-unnecessary connection to core stats (hacks don't necessarily need stats, actually), and mostly seem like an easy way to focus players' attention, instead of having this infinite sea of moves to potentially draw from (though Vincent's linked post about "arenas of conflict" is also interesting). But it is a thing that's easy to take from AW.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383306">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Evil%20Genius" title="Evil Genius"><img alt="Evil Genius" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/933/nIYAYGDL37TU5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Evil%20Genius">Evil Genius</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383306/#Comment_383306" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-25T03:09:42+00:00" title="June 25, 2012  3:09AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 25, 2012 3:12AM by Evil Genius.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's not much I can add to what's been said already, but these are my personal observations from having Played characters in both <b>AW</b> and <b>MH</b>.

You can check your set of moves against another work in the same genre to make sure they're complete and sound.</blockquote>\nAW actually provides us a very simple system through which to interpret narrative (i.e., a set of hard moves made by embodied characters that force negotiations with the very things that endanger the characters most), and this tool allows us to bridge the gap between protagonist-centered media and the tabletop RPG.<br/><br/>It straight-jackets us into being interesting, like a good screenplay.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383323">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383323/#Comment_383323" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-25T10:09:46+00:00" title="June 25, 2012 10:09AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Evan:</b> That's true too, but -- as Vx says over on Anyway -- you have to be careful in genre emulation to not "take conflicts' escalation and resolution out of the hands of the characters and puts them in the hands of formula." It's not really a straight-jacket; you can still do all sorts of things that aren't defined by established moves. The formal moves are almost purely carrots and not much stick at all. It's critical that the players use the moves because that's what they actually choose to do, not because the genre requires them to do things in a certain way. In AW, you can perform violence without Seizing By Force or Going Aggro, and you can do social things without Seducing or Manipulating. One of the more difficult parts of MCing, actually, in my experience, is figuring out when different methods are required, since the moves are right there in front of you and it's easy to use them even when it's not exactly appropriate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383327">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner" title="Evan_Torner"><img alt="Evan_Torner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/278/nHOYP3VNJB6A6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner">Evan_Torner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383327/#Comment_383327" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-25T11:06:04+00:00" title="June 25, 2012 11:06AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Agreed.

And only by doing moves do you advance <i>play</i> (not necessarily the diegetic "story," which may be lurching in fits and bounds between the moves).<br/><br/>It turns out that we really <i>didn't</i> know what we were doing when creating genre RPGs until AW came along and said: "Dude, make the PCs make those gut-wrenching choices that keep us engaged with the genre fiction despite their repetitive conventions <b>and</b> don't let the GM think they know all the answers about the PCs' actions."<br/><br/>AW incentivizes contractual risk in non-linear plotlines to easily generate story threads, while also rewarding player ingenuity and character role-play in grasping for the solution.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383332">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383332/#Comment_383332" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-25T11:52:48+00:00" title="June 25, 2012 11:52AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sullivan,<br/>  I feel like AW finds a new balance between Freeform and tight codification of the system.<br/>  The only "System" that players can interact with are the moves. There is no other mechanics to interact with.<br/>  The system makes up for it by playing fast and loose with the tables it presents.<br/>  "Open your brain" is the most overt example of this. The player is rolling for a very specific thing, but the results are not codified to a level that the results are predictable.<br/>  Compare this to the die pools in DITV or the combat mechanics of D&amp;D and you can see what I mean. In D&amp;D even though the hit and damage numbers vary widely, the effect of using that system is predictable. There will be a fight and unless the opposing forces are relatively equally matched, you can even predict who will win. Similarly, by the time you start using the dice in DITV, the outcome is pretty predictable unless someone really risks a ton of fallout.<br/>  But in AW, if you interact with a mechanic, because of the lose guidance and the fact that there is no other system except for freeform roleplay, there is no predictability. The game just transitions from improv to guided improv and then back to improv.<br/>  That is not to say this is not a proper RPG or that there is no system to this game. But that, like in improv, you cannot control the narrative and you cannot predict the narrative (similar, but different from InSpectres).<br/>  I, for one, welcome our new overlord, Master Vincent. but I can see why some people might be turned off by it.<br/>Dave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383333">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383333/#Comment_383333" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-25T11:57:00+00:00" title="June 25, 2012 11:57AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure that I grasp your meaning 100%, but it sounds like you're emphasizing that part of what AW does is gives players both genre AND choice, yeah?

It's just this game, right? And Vincent's just some dude! Pretending otherwise places it beyond the realm of 1) criticism and 2) hacking AW into other games that are just as good and/or better. <br/><br/>For one, Monsterhearts has WAY better text organization, in terms of presenting the rules to a new audience in a way that's easy to grok. After all, AW starts by giving you ALL THE PLAYBOOKS one after another (complete with a lot of material repeated 8+ times) with no context to help you understand what you're seeing. Kinda weird!<br/><br/>Also, there's a bunch of moves in AW that are less awesome even by AW's own standards, in that they don't reference the fiction very clearly. The most obvious ones are Harm and Barter, which are two little currency subsystems that don't often mesh well with the rest of the rules in terms of tone and content. They're fine and they work, but they stand out when compared to other moves that really hook into the fiction.<br/><br/>Generally, it seems like some of the stuff that was added late in the playtest cycle doesn't gel as strongly with the other pieces (surprise!). Highlighted stats was not the original XP system, but a later addition. It's also fine and has some really cool effects, but it's not as toothy or well integrated as some of the other mechanics. Have you noticed that they aren't referenced in other moves at all, unlike most other mechanics (including harm and barter)? Why aren't there PC moves that allow you to shift your highlighted stats?<br/><br/>In any event, just like the commonly used rules for NPCs in <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> have progressed since that game was published, there's no reason to think that AW as a rules text is beyond constructive criticism or even improvement. Apocalypse World isn't some magical gestalt of a bunch of things that's too complicated to break-down, analyze, and replicate or improve upon. In fact, it's written in a systematic, logical fashion and is built from modular components that make it easy to hack, especially given the guidance in the "Advanced Fuckery" chapter.<br/><br/>Yes, it's a thing worthy of praise, but the way to really understand it is to take it apart and put it back together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383435">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383435/#Comment_383435" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-26T10:49:04+00:00" title="June 26, 2012 10:49AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Yes, it's a thing worthy of praise, but the way to really understand it is to take it apart and put it back together.</blockquote>\nThanks for the reality check. This is some wise wisdom - personally, hacking AW has increased my appreciation for its subtlety and elegance a lot. As an adjunct to playing, it's the best way to get in there and see how everything works, and what works well, and what maybe doesn't.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383436">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner" title="Evan_Torner"><img alt="Evan_Torner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/278/nHOYP3VNJB6A6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner">Evan_Torner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383436/#Comment_383436" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-26T11:25:21+00:00" title="June 26, 2012 11:25AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The hagiography comes from the same kind of impulse people have to praise something like Legos (something else Vincent likes), namely:<br/><br/>For all their obvious flaws, <b>Legos change the way you think about constructive play.</b><br/><br/>Also, I'm not buying into a progress narrative by any stretch of the imagination. What I do see, however, is a shift (in AW) from games that meditate specifically on the relations between consumer affect and a given medium (i.e. <i>Primetime Adventures</i>) to pushing players to see those mechanisms that game designers themselves use to produce affect and encouraging them to fiddle with these mechanisms.<br/><br/>It's a game design that encourages you as the user to design for interesting/dangerous play. Whether or not we <i>like</i> the fact that a bunch of game designers are now using what amounts to a standardized set of tools is a different question altogether.<br/><br/>Yeah, sure, Vincent's just a human. Whatever. Humans have ideas and sometimes taking those ideas seriously produces tectonic shifts in culture.

I'm digging what I see of AW hacks and cannot wait to play them.<br/><br/>It changes the way I look at games, which is cool and made me think about the unspoken "GM moves" I use without thinking about it in my BW play.<br/><br/>The idea that AW somehow makes BW, Dogs, Shock: and InSpectres obsolete is not helpful and gets in the way of rooting through it and seeing what makes it tick. It muddies the waters.\n<blockquote>Could you please tell me what in this system, <b>in your opinion</b>, makes play special. What parts of the system cannot be removed for fear of it all falling apart? What are the parts of the system that you point to and think "Man, I want to play me some of that"?</blockquote>\nThe playbooks convey the setting in a really tight manner, getting the players into the mood simply by sifting through their choices and making a character. <br/><br/>The MC moves along with lack of MC dice-rolling allows the me, the MC to focus on making that world real, which is solid because my Burning Wheel brain damage is looking for Beliefs or something player-authored and AW doesn't necessarily give me too much of that. As the MC, I get to tread water, ask question, look over the MC moves, vomit apocalyptica and prod the PC's.<br/><br/>And the 7-9 rolls are where the rubber meets the road. This is where the game transcends MC hard moves and PC success and becomes something we can only make at the table between us folks playing. This is where we cut deals and find out how bad we want what we are pursuing and are surprised by the characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383438">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383438/#Comment_383438" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-26T11:51:16+00:00" title="June 26, 2012 11:51AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool, Evan.

Rolls ensure that every action triggers another action, but since consequences are logical and open enough, it never forces the game in a direction that makes no sense with the fiction. Narration and mechanics blend seamlessly into each other.<br/>Also, the concept of 'move' itself is a new cathegorization that was created with this game, if that's not an innovation, I don't know what qualifies as one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
