His son is Brett, a nervous farmer who came by the market to have lunch with his dad. Brett is a bad neighbor to Ro, a patriotic young Navy cadet shopping for a gift for his girlfriend. His girlfriend is Megan, a bitter bagger at the supermarket who has a simmering rivalry with the butcher. Shanie, the compassionate butcher, is John's other child and that relationship is the only reason she has this job.<br/><br/>So air raid sirens blare, a mist rolls in and most people don't really pay attention. When the mist gets REALLY thick, a crowd starts forming along the front window display. Just then, a pickup truck crashes through the window, ramping up over the cash registers and wedging itself over the checkout lanes with the engine still running. People are screaming, injured, bleeding. A real commotion. Meanwhile, the mist is flooding in through the gaping hole in the front of the market.<br/><br/>From there, the characters try to help the injured (to various effect), wander through the mist finding a toy store next door, coming back to the market to find shelter in the bank vault underneath. Scary things they saw include:\n<ul>\n<li>The toddler that should have been in the pickup truck, but is missing from her car seat. She is found in the toy store. But also seen begging to be let into the supermarket. Also seen as a part of a grotesque monster clutching at the cashier's ankles.</li>\n<li>A dark toy store full of catatonic children holding glowworm dolls. The green light illuminating their faces in a sickly hue. As the heroes approach, the children are tugged away further into the darkness.</li>\n<li>The butcher shop in the supermarket. The ground beef is twitching and squirming underneath their plastic wrappings. The cold cuts and exposed slabs of meat are slithering across the tables.</li>\n<li>A tentacle grasping at people at various moments. A many-elbowed toddler's arm with a chubby toddler's hand at the end, clutching at people's clothes.</li>\n<li>Dopplegangers of a few of the characters, begging to be let into the now-secured supermarket.</li>\n</ul>\nI initially conceived the point of departure from the movie being the truck bashing through the front window, thereby making the supermarket not a viable shelter. The players introduced a lot of practical aspects of the supermarket's security though, including a drop-down gate that falls down in front of the store when it's closed. <br/><br/>The quick character generation actually <i>frighteningly</i> well. For a group with mixed exposure to RPGs, I think that was probably the right way to go. I layed out three rows of cards face down. The top row was a personality. The middle row was a job. The bottom row was a relationship to the character on your left. Everyone just picked one card from each row, laughed a little bit when they saw what they drew, then settled into their characters really quickly.<br/><br/>The interwoven relationships naturally gelled together, like the cashier having two children from two mothers, the relationship between the soldier and the bagger, the rivalry between the bagger and the butcher. It was all really easy.<br/><br/>Generally the atmosphere was much more Japanese horror than Lovecraftian monsters, which was fine since two of the players hadn't seen the movie anyway.<br/><br/>The first portion of the game went waaay longer than I thought because the players were SO good at Jenga. The tower went almost 32 storeys tall! It wasn't for lack of trying to make things really scary and tense. The one trick I did to ramp up the tension was to start counting down from 30 seconds if people took too long to pull a block. That made everyone REALLY nervous.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239902/#Comment_239902" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-31T09:57:54+00:00" title="October 31, 2009  9:57AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Counting down is an excellent technique!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_239935">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239935/#Comment_239935" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-31T14:24:20+00:00" title="October 31, 2009  2:24PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some of the folks thought it was kinda mean, but I was pretty generously slow with my countdown.

One thing I realized early on was that one player was getting more calls to pull than others, but only because her character was doing some pretty dangerous stuff. The unexpected side effect of this was that she had REALLY steady hands. She could probably win a normal game of Jenga pretty consistently.<br/><br/>Heck, at one point I actually stomped the floor really hard to simulate the sound of a giant monster approaching. My hope was that the vibrations would make the tower more unstable, but it had no effect. :P<br/><br/>If we play again, I am curious about playing with the blocks in different situations.<br/><br/>* You have to disarm a bomb by pulling two wires. You only have thirty seconds before the bomb explodes. Pull two blocks and place them on the top of the tower before the countdown ends.<br/><br/>* Pull a block, but keep it to maintain your composure for now. You have to put up all your blocks on the tower the next time you pull. You're just delaying the inevitable.<br/><br/>* If you have any saved blocks, do something that acts out your relationship to another character. In doing so, you can give one of your blocks to that player. The next time they have to put blocks on the tower, they must put them all up, including the ones you gave them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
