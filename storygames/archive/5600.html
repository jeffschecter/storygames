I was asked to exaplin this over on the CE site and thought I would repeat that here to see if anyone else has made a similar change and if so why.<br/><br/>First of all it doesn't change my central resolution mechanic. At the moment you roll some dice as does the nemesis and you compare the number of 4+ rolls you get. There are 3 degrees of success:<br/><br/>Triumph: Hero gets at least double the nemesis<br/>Overcome: Hero beats the nemesis<br/>Fail: Nemesis beats the hero<br/><br/>Now this is just a bunch of 50/50 randomisers being chucked and so could easily be coins, bits of toast, dead hamsters or, yes you guessed it, cards. Cards are more readily available in people's homes than several d6 so I think this is a decent change. Instead of looking for 4+ you are looking for red cards. Easy. Yes I know the probabilities are not exactly the same but they are close enough.<br/><br/>However this change affords me a chance to play another trick. One of the things that I haven't been entirely happy with in reel adventures is the finality of the resolution system. You describe some stuff, roll and then describe the outcome. I have always wanted their to be a bit more 'narrative tennis' going on between the two sides. <br/><br/>Now when I was running conteders I noticed that turning cards over one at a time lent a tension and anticipation to the proceedings that could easily be used as a narrative guideline.<br/><br/>So, this is how I am thinking of doing it:<br/><br/>1) Each side draws cards for background and lays them face down on the table in front of them. <br/><br/>2) Both sides reveal one card at a time. The highest red card wins, hearts winning if there is a tie. If both cards are black the highest black card wins, spades if there is a tie. The winner gets to narrate a snippet of the scene. This continues until both sides have revealed all their cards. If one side can't reveal a card then the other gets narration rights.<br/><br/>Once all cards are revealed the side with the most red cards, or hearts if there is a tie, wins the action and gets to narrate the outcome. The mechanical result depends on whether they triumph, overcome or fail.<br/><br/>I think this could work really nicely, going to test it with Cath on the train up home tonight.<br/><br/>So bascially my reasons are:<br/><br/>1) Doesn't change the central mechanic at all<br/>2) Cards are easier to get than dice<br/>3) I can play some narrative tricks<br/><br/>I will have to see how it goes but I may make it that the side with the highest card gets to narrate ala contenders for more narrative fun and interaction.<br/><br/>So has anyone else changed from dice to cards and why? have you gone the other way?<br/><br/>Cheers<br/><br/>Iain                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125384">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125384/#Comment_125384" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-09T08:53:46+00:00" title="February  9, 2008  8:53AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 9, 2008 8:54AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like cards and have been drawn to them recently when I'm adding randomness.  You have more variables to tap, and can increase the granularity of results in interesting ways that don't rely on a bell curve or linear distribution.  <br/><br/>I like the fact that you can have a simultaneous reveal with cards - they are big and graphic and there's a kinesthetic quality to them that dice don't have.  Like you said, the chase mechanic in PTA and slow reveal in Contenders demonstrates this wonderfully..<br/><br/>It's easier to retain cards for later use - for example, in <i>Night Witches </i>the result of one conflict leaves you with a neat stack of eight cards that you then re-purpose for something entirely different.  So the result of one thing generates the materials you need for the next thing, even though they aren't related.  This would be clumsier to do with dice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135051">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg" title="madunkieg"><img alt="madunkieg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg">madunkieg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135051/#Comment_135051" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-15T13:53:43+00:00" title="March 15, 2008  1:53PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 15, 2008 1:57PM by madunkieg.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How many cards will you need for a particular set of draws? If it's always less than 13, then I'd say just use a single suit, and there's no more need for all those tiebreaking rules (I always consider more than a single tiebreaking rule to be a sign of something wrong with a mechanic, but that's just me). Or 2 suits allows you to get away with just 1 tiebreaking rule.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust don't shrink the deck to the point where it needs reshuffling every 60 seconds.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
