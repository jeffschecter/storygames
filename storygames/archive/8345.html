I am looking for some help. I think this is to large of a project for me to go alone on. Basically I would like to have a nice playtest document together by the end of Jan or early Feb for all three books. Does anyone want to jump in on this project? <br/><br/>For those of you that don't know what Wanderer is... It's taking the three little black books from Traveller and making it into a fantasy game. <br/><br/>Some things that need to be done that I am not good at:<br/>Spelling, grammar, readability, editing, etc<br/>Does the document make sense<br/>Flow<br/>Is the game incorporating some of advice/aspects of Making Traveller Awesome.<br/><br/>As soon as the documents are ready I'd like to get a website together where all the stuff is hosted at and then turn it loose for playtesting.<br/><br/>Time line<br/>Playtest documents and website ready by mid-Feb<br/>Two months playtest time (is that about right for the first round)<br/>Rework as needed from feedback<br/>Release Beta version for another round of playtesting by start of summer 09<br/><br/>That's as far as I want to plan at the moment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thanks!<br/>Ara                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
