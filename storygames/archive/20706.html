Games like Fiasco, Baron Munchausen, A Penny for Your Thoughts,  etc, they look like they can really "put you on the spot".<br/>"Here, be creative, right now! Lest ye be judged!"<br/><br/>This is scary. <small>I'm not saying whether or not it really <b>is</b> that difficult to create on the spot. Maybe it's not, maybe it is. But. It <b>looks</b> difficult and it <b>looks</b> like you'll be judged and found inadequate.</small><br/><br/>And the normal people who like games like Trivial Pursuit and Scrabble, they're like "uh... no thanks, I'm... busy that day", they see this creativity as something that is reserved for creative types and artists and "those others" with their paint stained overalls and untuned guitars, not us normal people with cars and a couple of hours over for Candy Crush.<br/><br/>2. So then the target audience is for those hippies, those drama majors?<br/>Sure, here we have a greater niche but here the scare-factor is "Oh, it's too nerdy, I tried once and it was so complicated with opportunity attacks and proficiency bonus and procedural scenes and tilt tables and and..."<br/><br/><br/><br/>In short: a mainstream game needs to consider:<br/>1. Creative demands that can scale. That allow your creative contributions to shine when you've got some ideas, and let you to just sit back and go along when you don't have any ideas. (B/X and BECMI did this well. Fiasco actually also does ok, you can just say "I want to resolve", as long as <i>someone</i> is creative around the table. APFyT is awful in this regard though.)<br/><br/>2. <i>Simple</i> and deep rules. Nerds, wait, make that all game designers, always overestimate how difficult learning and understanding their rules are for new players.<br/><br/>eh. <br/><br/>and I wrote all this. And then I re-read the "Indie Games Are Missing the Target" article and he brought up both of mine:\n<blockquote> - Most coherent games need all participants to learn the rules of the game.<br/>- IGT ones don\u2019t, only one has to make the effort.<br/>[...]<br/> - Most coherent games require active and constant creative involvement (and social responsibility) from all participants.<br/>- IGT ones don\u2019t, you can just be a more or less interactive audience for the GM\u2019s story/show, and unless you truly behave like an ass any problematic thing you do is expected to be death with and smoothed out by the GM.</blockquote>\nOK. So this whole post was unnecessary at least as its own thread. But.

It was fine but I remember there being some frustration when one of the players ended the game with a not very creative twist just to get to her ending. There was some contention about how "easy" it was to change the story to fit the cards. Part of that was a competitive mind set, but I think some more rules about voting would help the game. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454750">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454750/#Comment_454750" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-07T19:44:03+00:00" title="July  7, 2016  7:44PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have a very uphill battle to get people to play OOaT and Pictionary with me.<br/>I have a friend who loves OOaT and I want to get her to join my D&amp;D group.

This study alone justifies my aversion to play like, 80% of story games I've seen through all the time I've been lurking SG. It's not that they were bad games, it's just that a lot of them are too upfront demanding in creative terms that I often feel like, even being a creative person, that I can't make quality material on the spot in the same amount and consistence the game requires.<br/><br/>About <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> (and a bit of <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> too) I've been analyzing my group and my own skillset, and how these engage and relate with different games. There are people who can literally hear numbers talk, they can see an excel spreadsheet and feel a living town in it. But they have problems if everything is about relating words and/or spatial imagination. <br/><br/>If you tell me to throw a handfull of sand to the air in my imagination, stop it in the air and then imagine all those sandgrains rotate 180 around an imaginary line, shaping the same amount of circles as grains, I can easily do so, rotate that shape in my imagination and draw it from any point of view. This paragraph alone is enough to give my number-oriented pal a headache. Literally.<br/><br/>But then again show me that spreadsheet and it won't be nothing but boring number to me, and while through some effort I can understand the information, I'd find it more useful if it was a list of words, a map or a drawing.<br/><br/>So, when my pal designed a game, it wasn't a surprise for me that it used a d100+attributes+skill+ specialization bonuses besides items, virtues and flaws that modified that, along with situational modifiers of +/-20 and +/-50, while insisting the game was insanely simple (well, it is for his standards and I get most of the game, but I wouldn't offer it to a complete newbie as his first RPG. I couldn't be able to GM it properly anyway. A lot of people can, but there's also a lot of people like me who can't)<br/><br/>When I designed my game "Offline" after a lot of trial, error and further research of different mechanics hacked from both trad and dirty hippie games, I gave it a good thought about what I've been calling Accessibility in various threads recently, which comes down to lower your design minimum requirements so people with different skillsets can engage with it completely and then add those skillsets to increase their own fun and the fun of the people around them.<br/><br/>At some points it means just to explain things briefly more than once in more than one section, and cross reference as well, because people with memory issues will certainly appreciate this. Examples, Actual play reports, Visual aids like flowcharts and Comics, Video tutorials, every little thing counts and is crucial to help players learn the proper way to play the game. It doesn't matter if they deconstruct it later and make their own way of playing the game, as designers we have to be responsible because there are lots of pieces in our games that are potential problems for gameplay, and it's our duty to identify them and either smooth them out or prevent players against them. <a href="http://thepeakperformancecenter.com/educational-learning/learning/principles-of-learning/learning-pyramid/" rel="nofollow">Check this out.</a><br/><br/>At other points it passes for making good playing advice into rules. You need to be that assertive because when players read a rulebook they are looking for clear procedures to get things going in the best way possible. By offering them as advice instead of rules, you come off as insecure, like, you don't know if this good advice actually works or not, otherwise you would have included it in the rules. Of course, you still need to be careful about what of that advice you turn into rules and how do you express them, but rest assured, nobody follows rules they don't like nor blames the author for putting those there. As a designer, no matter if you write "You must do X in this game" you're not forcing people to do X, they will easily discern by themselves if it's a good/necessary part of the procedure or not. How many of you uses encumbrance rules<i> because the book told you so</i>? <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/evolution-the-self/201606/are-you-assertive-enough-heres-25-ways-tell" rel="nofollow">Check this out.</a><br/><br/>Then at other moments it passes for offering optional rules for people to add their skillset to the fullest. The basic system doesn't need too much numbers, but you can easily offer an alternate character sheet that does consider several more variables, and a explanation of how to use them. You can give alternate rules about grid and minis use as well, or even just suggest how can the game be otherwise modified to suit different tastes.<br/><br/>On the end Accessibility means: Designer,  put on the reader's shoes, don't assume they have your skillset nor your problems with certain mechanics, nor your knowledge about RPGs, nor your hate/love for some type of games, etc. The more different kind of readers you can make your game for, the better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454768">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454768/#Comment_454768" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-07T22:15:59+00:00" title="July  7, 2016 10:15PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When it comes to skillsets, <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/20661/what-s-your-ideal-rpg-curriculum" rel="nofollow">this thread</a> seems like it might be quite relevant...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454784">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454784/#Comment_454784" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-08T05:34:05+00:00" title="July  8, 2016  5:34AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I agree that <i>comparative</i> creativity is a big deal here<br/>People being creative in secret that's easier                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454792">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454792/#Comment_454792" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-08T07:30:54+00:00" title="July  8, 2016  7:30AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I read somewhere that people's first forays into story games will be totally gonzo and that it's usually a phase<br/></blockquote>\nGonzo, in what way?<br/><br/>One reason people couldn't understand story games (if you by "story games" mean "indie/Forge games") in the beginning was because of the tradition in roleplaying games of not describing how to play the game -

Nerds, wait, make that all game designers, always overestimate how difficult learning and understanding their rules are for new players.</blockquote>\nI completely agree with your analysis and I've been messing around with a simple diceless system that may serve as a backbone for a shy-people-friendly game:<br/><br/>- The role of Narrator is rotative and as a Narrator you have complete freedom (<i>some limits/guidelines may be required in a final ruleset</i>).<br/>- After a stipulated period of time (<i>30 sec</i> or <i>5 sentences</i> or <i>as soon as any other player raises his hand</i>) the Narrator must stop and the other players can suggest possible continuations for the story (<i>if they want</i>). Then the current Narrator must "<i>buy</i>" the continuation that he finds more inspiring to the player that suggested it by paying a token. <br/>- Once the Narrator runs out of tokens his role is passed to the player that has most tokens in that moment and the story continues.<br/><br/>For an even more shy-friendly enviroment you could try the following optional rule:<br/><br/>- Instead of proposing a new continuation you can extend the continuation suggested by another player (adding a twist or a detail that you consider interesting), but you must pay a token to that player in advance, so you are going to lose a token unless your extended version is selected by the current Narrator.<br/><br/>This system (<i>I call it Distributed Storytelling System</i>) was meant to be played online (<i>whith the Narrator writing a blog-post once a day and the players suggesting continuations in the comments</i>) but, when played around a table, it allows shy players to sit in silence for as long as they wish and contribute only when they feel prepared. It even allow people to enter or leave the game at any moment, so you only need 3 engaged players to make it work at any time.<br/><br/>In that sense, and taking into account that this is just a draft, it satisfies your demands of simplicity and shy-players friendlyness.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454796">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454796/#Comment_454796" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-08T10:48:46+00:00" title="July  8, 2016 10:48AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It looks like you'll run into similar problems that A Penny For My Thoughts have:<br/><br/>1.

In particular, it should evolve to become less <i>competitive</i> than it currently sounds...<br/><br/>For example, another optional rule that I'm planning to include is that anybody can give anybody else a token every time he considers that the other person has done something great.<br/><br/>The idea is to use the tokens to express mechanically things that usually are just implicit (from "<i>Ei! That was a great idea!</i>" to "<i>I want to hear your version of this</i>").<br/><br/>At the same time, the "<i>please, give me ideas to continue the story</i>" mechanic may serve as a lifesaver to shy people once "<i>in the spot</i>". They can just say a pair of obvious sentences and ask for creative help as soon as they feel stuck.<br/><br/>The final objective is to help everyone to overcome their fear by giving them the option (instead of <i>the obligation</i>) to participate. The biggest risk is to get shy players overwhelmed by the creativity of less shy players (and this is why the "<i>you can extend another players continuation</i>" was created).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_454800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan" title="AnonAdderlan (Banned)"><img alt="AnonAdderlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan">AnonAdderlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454800/#Comment_454800" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-08T13:38:48+00:00" title="July  8, 2016  1:38PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So considering the conclusions in <a href="http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-1-4615-0801-4_3" rel="nofollow">the paper</a> <a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">@WarriorMonk</a> linked to it's a wonder that RPGs are a thing at all.

Besides that, how many people would be willing to do karaoke with total strangers without alcohol?<br/><br/>Anyway, all those obstacles (Expected reward, competition, surveillance, time limits, and evaluation) can be overcome if presented in a less demanding way, if used sparingly or just in different moments of the game, as most of us have proven in different games. <br/><br/>We've been playing for ages using XP, loot and more as rewards, we've been having fun betraying each other in Paranoia, we've been playing while being observed in conventions and faced time limits there and even in our own houses. And it's not like Story Games aren't played at all. I've tried my some of own designs around player created material and found out that it's all about how do you ask the players for the material, when, how much do you ask and your reaction to their input.<br/><br/>-You can ask for background stories between sessions ans thus eliminate time pressure, often you will find players making pages and pages of historical background around their characters. <br/><br/>-Right after one player has given an input, the next will feel reassured with this cue and give their own input. Each input gives more clues to the next player about how to present information and the limits of their agency on the fiction.<br/><br/>-React positively by not blocking the first player input and inmediately building over it, this acts as an incredible reward and builds trust instantly. You will see players autoedit themselves later and if you're often consequent with whatever was stated from the start of the game, things can go wild but never gonzo.<br/><br/>-Avoid Gonzo by blocking but based only on consistency. This means that players can keep coming up with strange ideas, but only as long as these don't contradict/negate the existance of ideas previously established. If it makes sense for the world they are creating, embrace it. If it can't be because anything you established before, offer a different suggestion.<br/><br/>I've got more of this tricks that now I consider as rules for whenever I play, but right now I don't have enough time to list them all, my boss is about to come.

"Sam-" can mean tillsammans - "together" - but also samh\xf6righet - "togetherness". Sure, we all play roleplaying games together but we shouldn't forget to build that feeling of togetherness.

It can, however, also be from people thinking that they need to preform something that surprises everyone at every time. <i>Impro</i> is talking about being boring (Anyone who read <i>Play Unsafe</i> recognizes this) - about saying ordinary stuff and predictable things - about saying the first thing that comes into mind instead of trying to create something spectacular every time.<br/><br/>I tried that, in both others' creations but also build it into my own, and it creates something down to earth and yet engaging. We're used to playing fantasy and otherwordly experiences. Perhaps collaborative storytelling is sometimes better off with something ordinary?

I agree with Jason that, for many people, it's a "phase". Humour and "gonzo" creativity can be an easy way for people to avoid "feeling judged" in a creative venture.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/7776/please-stop-the-virgins-laughing" rel="nofollow">My thread on this from a few years back...</a><br/><br/>I haven't found any easy way to get around it. I've tried "warmup exercises", tone discussions, and lots of other things*. Ultimately, the player has to a) have a desire for more 'serious' story gaming in the first place, and b) enough experience and/or discussion to realize that this is not only possible but also something to strive for. And selecting for the right people is important, too: gather the people for the game who share your interests.<br/><br/>Here's another thing: a lot of people, when invited to play a game if this sort, simply can't even *imagine* that it will be a *serious* process. "Making things up" is very strongly associated with "getting silly" in most modern cultures. Making something consistent and interesting doesn't even *occur* to most people until they've played a few times and someone brings it up.<br/><br/><br/>*: For instance, I designed and played a game very similar to what <a href="/forums/profile/CarlosLuna">@CarlosLuna</a> describes above. (That's what the linked thread was talking about.)<br/><br/>After an initial game which devolved into "wackiness", I gathered the same crowd again and asked them if they were interested in making it "less gonzo" this time. They all showed interest. Then we went through a free association 'warmup exercise', and I was amazed: we were all immediately on the same page! People were doing an *amazing* job of "being obvious" and sticking to our agreed genre and tone. Clearly, they just *got it* - they understood exactly what I had talked about and were immediately able to put it into practice.<br/><br/>Great! I pulled out the game proper and we started to play...<br/><br/>...and it was just like the first time. Just as gonzo, just as silly!

They all showed interest. Then we went through a free association 'warmup exercise', and I was amazed: we were all immediately on the same page! People were doing an *amazing* job of "being obvious" and sticking to our agreed genre and tone. Clearly, they just *got it* - they understood exactly what I had talked about and were immediately able to put it into practice.<br/><br/>Great! I pulled out the game proper and we started to play...<br/><br/>...and it was just like the first time. Just as gonzo, just as silly! Huh.</blockquote>\nYeah, I've experienced the same thing from <i>both</i> sides of the exercise. It's deeply puzzling. Perhaps the context of 'warmup' provides more permission or an objective to be serious? Perhaps behavior and situation are linked on a subconscious level which cannot be changed through conscious means?\n<blockquote>By "more like karaoke," you mean "self-selecting for a subset of people who want to do that activity in front of other people, while strongly repelling another subset of people (who would rather eat live scorpions than even attempt it)"?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(I was thinking the very same... karaoke is a pretty polarizing activity, in my experience!)</blockquote>\nHeh, I guess RPGs are <i>already</i> a lot like karaoke then <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I also don't believe singing a song you didn't compose is any different creatively than performing a play you didn't write, or even a standup routine you did.

Fiasco definitely guns for this with playsets, and does achieve some success there, although it can still be overwhelming to "read" the dice and not be sure where to put a die first.<br/><br/>I really like how Swords Without Master works. Before the game, you tell the prospective players to bring a piece of awesome (probably fantasy) artwork. You also bring some of your own, just in case they change their minds or forget to bring art--I actually have a deck of random Magic cards I got from a Secret Santa (I don't actually play, but the art is amazing for this). Then at character creation, you walk them through turning that artwork into a character. Then, in actual gameplay, it's heavily structured, and the two Overtones really help to suggest actions to the players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455219/#Comment_455219" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-23T16:48:58+00:00" title="July 23, 2016  4:48PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wonder if the tone switch implicitly gives players an "outlet" to get all wacky - and, conversely, reminds them when not to do so.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455224">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455224/#Comment_455224" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-23T22:19:34+00:00" title="July 23, 2016 10:19PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 23, 2016 10:20PM by Rickard.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Depends on what you mean with "tone".

Then content can be created as needed once the players interact with something.<br/><br/>Of that content you can mountain-witch some and go completely generic with the rest and it will work just fine. No strain on the GM, no overload on the players, no need for prep. I'm currently using a list of 8 questions to generate a setting and an adventure, which is quite entertaining to brainstorm with the players and works perfectly as an ice breaker with new players.<br/><br/>What I mean is that, <i>when you take away all the pressure about content creation, everybody wants to make up things</i>. I've been testing and witnessing it myself for the past year.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455297">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455297/#Comment_455297" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-26T18:42:05+00:00" title="July 26, 2016  6:42PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some people just aren't interested in that aspect.  It's that simple.  Whether this is innate or has been trained out of them by experience with D&amp;D is largely irrelevant as well.<br/><br/>Not everybody wants to make up things. <br/><br/>Which is fine. But people who aren't interested in making things up probably shouldn't play games in which they will be required to make things up.  However, I don't think that's a big problem.  Those people usually self select out of such things as they should.<br/><br/>Theory: Indie games have failed to "reach their target" because the baseline assumption that everyone is interested in being creative is false.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455298">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" title="Kenny_J"><img alt="Kenny_J" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J">Kenny_J</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455298/#Comment_455298" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-26T18:46:55+00:00" title="July 26, 2016  6:46PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think any person here is saying "everyone is interested in being creative" but certainly there are a <i>lot</i> of people who seem like they <i>would</i> be interested if given a safe place to do so, or made comfortable enough.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455299">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455299/#Comment_455299" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-26T18:48:38+00:00" title="July 26, 2016  6:48PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I don't think any person here is saying "everyone is interested in being creative" but certainly there are a <i>lot</i> of people who seem like they <i>would</i> be interested if given a safe place to do so, or made comfortable enough. </blockquote>\nI thought that was pretty much exactly what WarriorMonk was saying with "when you take away all the pressure about content creation, everybody wants to make up things."?  And I feel like it's been a general trend in indie games designers think "being creative is great, I want to give people more chances to be creative!"

On those cases I either ask for less of an input, give suggestions (interesting but really simple) or ask the next player, while this one relaxes a bit more.<br/><br/>For this particular, it's important to take any kind of input and make it awesome. The slightles attemp at blocking or editing the players upfront will definitely froze them in their tracks and make the most reluctant eject themselves from the game. I usually get a lot of people shouting anything jokingly thinking it won't make it into the game, but when they see it's accepted, built upon and turned into something awesome, they lower their guard and start having fun.<br/><br/>People who have problems coming up with stuff also seem to be the same people who aren't used to read nor consume stories through any other media (like movies, comics, etc) I've found these kind of players more than once, those are the most reluctant of them all. They usually have all kind of excuses and strong prejudices against roleplaying, games and even fiction in general, which they condemn as irresponsible escapism.

I recall a discussion a few weeks ago on reddit about the One Shot Podcast and I had commented that one of the reasons some people might not like it so much is the fact that, unlike improv, where you can toss an idea out there and if it's bad, the sketch is over in a few minutes, in a roleplaying game, that idea is there for the rest of the game, or even the rest of the campaign.<br/><br/>Nobody wants to be the person who randomly comes up with "a car that runs on farts" and then have to make fart noises for the next four hours. If you're bound by either the game or a sense of social obligation to use whatever people suggest, an idea that turns out badly can be even worse than fiddling your thumbs and shrugging when it's your turn to contribute.<br/><br/>Perhaps somewhat paradoxically, I'm at my most creative and roleplay most actively when I know that the things I come up with won't "matter" in the grand scheme of the game; this is especially noticeable in heavily procedural games and/or ones that are driven largely by GM agency (or even "railroady" if you prefer to think of it that way). Games where my personal creative contributions happen parallel to my mechanical contributions, rather than there being a strict causal relationship between the two. If I'm a minstrel at a fancy noble party and someone asks what kind of song I play, I'm more likely to say something interesting like, "A song that tells a tale of an old corrupt empire that's actually a secret polemic against the current ruling class," when I know that that choice isn't going to potentially derail the adventure and ruin the other players'/characters' plans.<br/><br/>Maybe think of it as "fake choices" in video games, where if you choose option A you get one cutscene, and if you choose option B you get another, but regardless of which cutscene you watch, the game itself progresses the same afterwards (maybe it changes a few pieces of inconsequential NPC dialogue, or gives you one special item rather than another).<br/><br/>I honestly don't know if this is a common source of creativity anxiety or not, but if I'm not alone in feeling this way, any attempt to foster a safe environment for creativity has to, perhaps against conventional logic and popular ideology, include a way of shielding players from negative consequences of speaking up. I have to know that, whether I describe my attack in a really cool way or just choose to roll a die, I'm still going to have the same chance of killing the monster. Beyond that, even if I weren't deathly afraid of screwing up every time I open my mouth, it's hard to be "on" all the time even if I want to be. I am fond of saying that roleplaying is its own reward and you should never force someone to do it, but I often come up against a contingent who feel like they deserve mechanical rewards for it, and sometimes I'm not sure if there's really a fair middle ground that doesn't alienate someone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455320/#Comment_455320" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-27T00:15:56+00:00" title="July 27, 2016 12:15AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>If this is the problem, I don't think it's solvable;  Sooner or later (probably sooner), <i>someone</i> has to step up and do something creative.

I've seen this again and again.<br/><br/>As I recently posted on this forum, I have never seen problems with gamers "not being creative enough". (Do you know anyone who was not welcome to play in games because they were "not creative enough"?)<br/><br/>Usually the issue is not about *how creative* you are, but the opposite: how good are you at applying constraints on your creativity? Are you able to stay "in the genre", or limit yourself to contributions which suit the theme of the game? Are you able to limit your contributions so that they always invite input from other players?<br/><br/>That, in my opinion, is the true challenge of roleplaying. <br/><br/>However, AnonAdderlan is quite correct *in theory*. Most/many attempts at bringing games into a "less creative" mode work, but quickly cross over the line where they're no longer creatively fulfilling. We <i>already have</i> "Choose your own adventure" books. We just aren't satisfied with those - we want more say in our fictional pursuits, we want our input to matter more than that, more than just choosing an option off a list.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455321">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455321/#Comment_455321" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-27T00:38:28+00:00" title="July 27, 2016 12:38AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 27, 2016 12:41AM by Paul_T.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'm at my most creative and roleplay most actively when I know that the things I come up with won't "matter" in the grand scheme of the game</blockquote>\nI find this absolutely puzzling and fascinating!<br/><br/>Who else feels this way?<br/><br/>I'm tempted to say that this is a product of conditioning. I can't know whether that's true for *you* (hypothetical reader who feels this way), but I'd like to put it out there, and you can tell me whether you agree or not.<br/><br/>I see this a lot in certain styles of "traditional" roleplaying. A perfect example is character creation: I've seen people happily write pages and pages of character backstory, but they freeze up completely if I say, "Ok, so you've lived in this neighbourhood for many years. What's your relationship with the local shopkeeper like? Do you get along?"<br/><br/>Because I've seen it so often with a specific style of play, I wonder if there's a relationship. <br/><br/>Here's the theory:<br/><br/>In games where the GM is primarily responsible for the vast majority of "plot content", or, basically, what happens and why, <i>player input effectively gets judged very harshly on unknown criteria</i>.<br/><br/>* The GM puts forward some fictional content. She also has a plan for what comes next.<br/>* The players interact with the content, doing some things.<br/>* Some of the players' input fits nicely with the intended "plot", and the game goes smoothly.<br/>* Some of the players' input does NOT work with the intended "plot", and, whether directly or indirectly (e.g. railroading, subtle social steering, peer pressure, negative consequences for the character, creating frustration in the GM, the game running off the rails, etc), that input is met with negative feedback. You do this and you get stung.<br/><br/>However, the player has (often) <b>no way</b> of knowing which it is going to be.<br/><br/>Over time, this player becomes conditioned to carefully vetting their input, always choosing safer options which cannot conflict with "the course of the game".<br/><br/>Most of this boils down to: <br/><br/>* Dramatic character acting (voices, accents, descriptions, posturing, acting)<br/>* Fleshing out background information (e.g. the character backstory)<br/>* Choosing mechanical builds, detailing character possessions (e.g. drawing the character's favourite shield)<br/>* Playing to effectively help the party once an objective is determined<br/>* Selecting the best options available in combat or other rules-bounded situations<br/>* Interactions ("roleplaying") between two player characters (which may skirt but never actually turn into conflict)<br/><br/>My feeling is that this can turn into an ingrained habit which is very difficult to break.<br/><br/>Does this ring true to anyone? <br/><br/>Otherwise, I see fairly little rhyme or reason in common tendencies like:<br/><br/>* A player is too "shy" to make significant choices in-character or to narrate details about the developing fiction<br/>* However, they have no problem drawing a map of the game world, bringing an illustration of their character, painting a miniature, or telling a story about the history of an off-screen historical artifact<br/>* They also have no problem wearing a costume and speaking in different voice (e.g. a fake accent), or adopting physical mannerisms to portray their character.<br/><br/>It's hard for me to see how the first could be driven by shyness and a fear of being judged if the second and third are not similarly "scary". Surely, all three are, at worst, similarly socially risky?<br/><br/>I'd love to hear your thoughts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455323">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jangler" title="jangler"><img alt="jangler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jangler">jangler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455323/#Comment_455323" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-27T01:17:29+00:00" title="July 27, 2016  1:17AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think those three points are listed by descending order of scariness. The first one always has fictional consequences, the second one sometimes does (drawing a map, making up history), and the third rarely does and is usually just flavor.<br/><br/>I think some players are worried about <i>damaging</i> the game and the fiction by their actions, and maybe they feel social pressure by being put "on the spot" by a GM. When I GM games, I usually like to ask players questions about their characters' background details individually in an asynchronous communication medium (i.e. not in person or voice chat), and they're generally happy to provide/invent that sort of information, being fully aware that it will be incorporated into the game world. But if I did the same thing while we were playing, <i>then</i> I might get "Uhh\u2026"-class responses.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455325">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455325/#Comment_455325" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-27T02:13:14+00:00" title="July 27, 2016  2:13AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for engaging with me on this.

But they're fundamentally different types of questions, and would generate different types of deliberation.<br/><br/>"X is happening; how does your character react?" mostly relies on the existing fiction as a guide for the answer, and if in doubt, a player can draw on their own life experiences and their experiences from consuming other fiction to help them answer the question. People make decisions all the time. People see other people \u2013 fictional or not \u2013 make decisions all the time, and usually empathetically understand the basis for that decision-making. People often say (whether they're correct or not) that a given decision is/was either good or bad.<br/><br/> "Does your character have any experience with X?" requires the player to write fiction from a perspective that they're often not used to, an authorial perspective. In real life, when you're asked "Do you have any experience with X?", you call on your memory, which is of little use in an equivalent roleplaying context. In addition, roleplaying games usually take place in exotic or fantastic settings, so there's a limited ability to ground your answer in modern-day real-world knowledge. The question has implications (with regard to your example: which religion? which fanatics? what experiences?) that need to be answered as well if the answer is "yes". Nearly everyone has <i>some</i> experience with taking an authorial perspective (and with bullshitting), but a non-author and non-story-gamer is likely to be <del>much</del> less comfortable answering this sort of question. And it's hard to judge the "value" of an authorial-type answer. Players will naturally keep the nature of the game in mind as they think about these things, so another question surfaces: is it good or bad for the fiction and for the game if my character doesn't have any experience with religious fanatics?<br/><br/>This doesn't mean that a question of one type will necessarily be harder than a question of the other type \u2013 for certain people, each might be easy. But they call on different skills, so they're not going to be equivalently difficult by default.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455330">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jangler" title="jangler"><img alt="jangler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jangler">jangler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455330/#Comment_455330" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-27T03:43:53+00:00" title="July 27, 2016  3:43AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Is it good or bad for the fiction and for the game if my character makes this decision?" might a question that would surface as well, but IMO in most cases that would only consciously come up after initial considerations that may already be strong enough justifications to dictate the outcome one way or another.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455332">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455332/#Comment_455332" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-27T04:52:46+00:00" title="July 27, 2016  4:52AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That logic makes some sense.

It's not just me that is going to sit there and talk, it has to be a conversation. I'm a lazy game master. I wont describe the environment, so it's up to the players to fill out the environment. So if I say "library", what could be in a library. [I then do an exercise where I ask them what's in a library, and use "Yes, and" and "Yes, but".]<br/><br/>The players should never worry about making up too much stuff, because I got two tools to work with. I can use "Yes, and" to add more stuff to what they invented. I can also use "Yes, but" to restrict something the players made up, like how all the computers were taken by other visitors [an example from the exercise].<br/><br/>By telling the players that I can always restrict them, it's one step in getting them less insecure. I need to break that feeling down of damaging the game master's ideas, and any player creative blocks. (Other means I have is that InSpectres is played through a short amount of time, it's a one-shot, and I prefer to play it in a silly way.)<br/><br/>(Hmm, I had thoughts about doing a video about how I pitch InSpectres, and even play the whole game - but only from the game master's perspective.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455336">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jangler" title="jangler"><img alt="jangler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jangler">jangler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455336/#Comment_455336" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-27T13:10:06+00:00" title="July 27, 2016  1:10PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>On the contrary, it seems that, overwhelmingly, people new to games have little difficulty with this.

As a non-story gamer who doesn't really like the idea of having the powers of a GM in game (because I think that division is important to immersion), I can tell you when you start out with an assumption that people need to be fixed, or were somehow improperly shaped by a game they loved growing up, you are never going to convince them of anything. And you are also starting from a very flawed foundation that feels more like an inquisition than a serious attempt to grow interest in a style of play that means a great deal to you. I don't have any issues with people liking different styles of play. I do get irked when my style or my experience is dismissed as something like flawed programming. Also framing it as a failure of or lack of creativity, completely misses the point. That is like seeing someone who doesn't like apple pie and saying "what is wrong, you don't like flavor?

I really don't have time to delve into this today, but I will try to explain my issue as clearly and succinctly as I can. This forum talks about play style difference all the time. That is isn't a problem. Where you guys tend to go off the rails is you play armchair psychologist and lean toward somewhat self righteous modes of analysis. Every time old school, traditional, D&amp;D or even just any non-story game top of play comes up, the reasons you reach for to explain them are almost always insulting toward intelligence, maturity or creativity in some way. Whether it is because you are comparing the style to playing with toys, saying it is because people lack creativity, courage, a failure to respect player rights or refuse simply because they grew up on D&amp;D, it is almost always done in a wholly negative way. When I point this out people will sidestep and say that isn't really what is being said but you are using language like 'not interested in being creative', 'players rights', and 'wanting toys not games'. I am not generally someone who gets hung up on language, but to me the word selection and the general approach seems to be either one of hostility toward people who are OSR/Traditional/Non-storygamer/or just like D&amp;D. And attempts to understand such people are usually done in a way that raises you up while putting them down, and cannot possibly result in genuine understanding of what motivates them. <br/><br/>Yes there are differences in taste and preference and yes our early experiences matter. But I don't think our early gaming experiences are as important as people here are saying, because you are building a straw man argument based on old school or traditional gamers who exist in your mind, not in reality. I started gaming in '86. The first game I played wasn't D&amp;D, but my first campaign after that was D&amp;D. I continued to play D&amp;D for ages, but I also played other games (GURPS, RUNEQUEST, VAMPIRE, CoC, TORG, BESM, ETC). This was by also the way most people I knew played RPGs. Everybody would always go back to D&amp;D, and that was usually the predominant system. I think not because people played it first but because it works very well for long term play----D&amp;D is just very easy to get off the ground and keep off the ground, whereas something like CoC might be more of a challenge-----I'd say the same of Vampire....both D&amp;D and Vampire always seemed to be the most consistently successful campaigns. That is a side issue though. The point is, you are assuming a lot about the people you are analyzing, but I don't think you really know much of anything about their play history, preferences, etc. <br/><br/>My observation ist hat D&amp;D is much more ubiquitous now than when I first started gaming. When I first started gaming it was very common to move from one game to another depending on who was GMing. When you went to a game store, there would be die hard GURPS fans, die hard Runequest fans, etc). Now you go to a game store it is all pathfinder and D&amp;D. So the idea that if you are gaming with a traditional GM or someone who cut their teeth in the early days of the hobby, that that person's experience is probably limited to D&amp;D just doesn't hold water for me. Personally I don't care what game people play or don't play. But this comes up enough here I think it is worth pointing out most of us who started in the 70s or 80s had plenty of ongoing experience with games that were not D&amp;D.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455341">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jangler" title="jangler"><img alt="jangler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jangler">jangler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455341/#Comment_455341" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-27T17:26:19+00:00" title="July 27, 2016  5:26PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Possible constructive questions for everyone: 1) how did <i>you</i> get involved in roleplaying games, and what was your first experience? 2) if your first experience wasn't an "indie" RPG, but you've played and enjoyed an "indie" RPG by now, how did you get involved in that? 3) what barriers, if any, did you recognize?<br/><br/>I'll answer first: 1) I got involved because I wanted to be, and my first experiences were a couple of small super-simplified D&amp;D-based one-offs that I ran in high school. I didn't really know enough people who were interested. 2) The most "indie" things I've played are FATE and Roll for Shoes, and I was the person who introduced each to the other players. 3) Perceived social stigma and big rulebooks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455342/#Comment_455342" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-27T17:32:19+00:00" title="July 27, 2016  5:32PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 27, 2016 5:32PM by WarriorMonk.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote> That is like seeing someone who doesn't like apple pie and saying "what is wrong, you don't like flavor? Clearly you ate all the wrong food growing up and are afraid to experience true deliciousness."</blockquote>\nHeh. Somewhat of a derrail, but for me it's more like, when I see someone who doesn't like apple pie I respect their tastes until they start saying apple pie is the worst crap ever invented, because I feel like they are disrespecting mine. I grew up being grateful of having food at all everyday, which helped me, if not to like everything, to at least respect all food.<br/><br/>Back to the issue, there's a mix of things in the root of most of the problems and a lot of problems going out at the same time:<br/><br/>-<b>"I don't trust you"</b>: in front of strangers or even in front of friends we have no guarantee we won't be judged negatively for certain behaviors. I know my own friends enough to know that they will laugh and won't have too much of an issue if I go to the next session dressed like Conan the Barbarian. But doing the same the whole campaign? That would qualify me as a lunatic forever. So, in society, it's commonly agree that it's okey to show a new angle of ourselves slowly, by bits, carefully of respecting everyone's sensitivity around us, see how they react and then modulate ourselves. <br/><br/>The process takes time and while people can be polite or tolerant enough to allow you skip a good part of that process, it's not like it's always good to abuse their tolerance. So, either giving input to the GM or dressing and speaking like the character, it's a matter of how much trust we have in others. We will be exposing ourselves and be judged not by our intent, but by how well we perform.<br/><br/>There's also a natural feeling of unsecurity when we realize somebody else in the table is playing god and seems able to jump over most of the rules, while we have to follow them all while not even being sure of what they all are. We will find later that there are a set of rules for the mechanics and another for how the fiction would react to our input. Between dealing with all these rules upfront and choosing to perform a character with all my might, I'll definitely chose the last one. In fact I recall that's exactly what I did the first times I roleplayed.<br/><br/>Even today I can't just trust systems/mechanics to bring up flow, since I'm conscious there will be actual people making most of the calls. I trust techniques and procedures more, since these either come after people has interpreted the rules or just get followed closer to the text than to the player's interpretation.<br/><br/>-<b>"I dont' trust myself" (a.k.a. that looks complicated):</b> similar to the previous point, except that we're considering here how the player feels about their own abilities and knowledge of either the game mechanics or the reference material. The same two things listed above bring this barrier down, and different motivations could lead the player later to increase their knowledge about the game or reference material, or just feel confident enough that as little as they have is enough to have fun with the group.<br/><br/>Here you also have issues dealing with not knowing how much are we being actually accepted or just tolerated. Am I too railroady as a GM? Does this person ejected from the game for something I did, didn't, for their own sensibility to the themes brought up in the game or for any other reason? I though my firends had lost their faith in me as a GM when one bailed out from a campaign. It turned out he was just personally disgusted with a body horror element used on one of the classes but didn't wanted to ruin the fun for everyone else. I did edit worse stuff from the game and thought it was okey, but when my pal drop out I felt less and less confident of my skills, until I canceled the whole campaign.<br/><br/>-<b>"I don't want that responsability"</b>: again a mix of the problems above: you go to the game for fun but you find out everyone's fun will depend on your skill, and you either don't trust your skill enough, nor trust everyone in the table will appreciate your input. You're not familiar with most or any procedures to create fun stuff for the game not have any idea on how to uphand whatever the other players have consumed so far in terms of creative content. Of course, this is part of why nobody jumps at being the GM and most people playing GMs feel like it's a chore. In most books the work is described as that of being an entertainer, and knowing the full content of the rules is a must in all rulebooks (though not every GM follows that requirement) Every player should have the right to sit back and relax a bit with the game, why the GM shouldn't?<br/><br/><br/><br/>So well, making things up is actually fun. It's when we feel that there things will be judged that it doesn't feel so much like fun anymore. Because of these barriers.<br/><br/>Things that bring these barriers down more easily: <br/>-witnessing in person someone of the group else giving input/playing a character in a way we consider sub-standard and seeing the group show a good reaction.<br/>-making an half-assed effort ourselves and see the group react positively beyound our expectations.<br/>-lower the<i> feeling of responsability over everybody's fun</i> for every player in the game (including the GM) - this can be done from the rules.<br/><br/>Things that bring those barriers down but take more of an effort:<br/>-Being outspoken about our expectations<br/>-Ask others for their feedback about our performance in the game<br/>-Try to prevent as much of the worst miscomunication cases, misinterpretations of the rules and other ways the game may backfire. This can be done from the rules too. I believe here that it's better to enforce this in the rules, instead of transmiting it to the players as "play advice", where it losts most of it's power.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455343">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455343/#Comment_455343" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-27T17:37:40+00:00" title="July 27, 2016  5:37PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good questions.\n<blockquote>1) how did you get involved in roleplaying games, and what was your first experience?</blockquote>\nMy brother dragged me into it, and it was a Choose your Own Adventure led by my brother.

Then watched some people playing. Most of how it went remained a mistery until a friend of mine told me about his VtM group and their adventures and then a space for a player opened. I went for a Malkavian partly because <i>I didn't had to make sense</i> It was kinda scary/uncomfortable/worrysome at first but then I got used to roleplaying. I didn't get to learn most of the system until later.<br/><br/>I think it took me a year to get to the idea of GMing, mostly because our current VtM GM didn't always made it on time or at all. I used Palladium's Robotech but hacked into d20 at middle campaign. Then I got used to hack games.<br/><br/>2) if your first experience wasn't an "indie" RPG, but you've played and enjoyed an "indie" RPG by now, how did you get involved in that?<br/>I hacked a lot of stuff out from indie games to use them for my trad campaigns. I think I only have played Kingdom as it was meant with my group. <br/><br/>3) what barriers, if any, did you recognize?<br/><br/>Getting used to play a character, finding confidence to do it. Trusting the group. These didn't actually took too much but I felt them as a barrier needed to enjoy the game. Then, system mastery, when a GM we met later started to make the game more competitive than narrative. I had a terrible experience with that. Complex systems stress me out too much up to the date because of that. It took 5e for me to finally get to DM D&amp;D. I couldn't even properly enjoy PF despite having a more narrative-oriented GM at that time.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455353">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455353/#Comment_455353" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-28T03:01:02+00:00" title="July 28, 2016  3:01AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very briefly (don't have time for a full post), but two things:<br/><br/>1. I'm beginning to think, more and more, that the important skill of a roleplaying/story/gamer is not imagination and creativity (I've yet to a see person fail on this front, unless given a total blank page-type situation, which is not what most good games do). Rather, it's the ability to *limit* your creative contributions in a way which suits the game being played. <br/><br/>Anyone can invent something new: "Ok, how about a robot? Robots are cool. And it's red." Limiting yourself to only contributing in certain, specific ways (who gets to say what about which topics, what are your "narrative authorities", and what suits the tone of the game), that's the tricky part, and not at all natural.<br/><br/>"Be obvious" is an example of this. It says to limit yourself to your first instinct, and not to try to overreach. Not a natural way to do things, but effective when grasped. (In my experience, gamers who think they're "not creative enough" don't lack creativity. Instead, they have set for themselves - in their minds - an improbably high bar for "creative" means. In most RPGs, saying "I swing my sword", or "it's a giant monster! with three eyes!" is more than enough. But these players tie themselves in knots thinking that <i>that's not good enough</i>, and then they freeze up. When I've been able to explain this to someone - and they actually listen - they usually relax and become awesome, creative gamers within minutes.)<br/><br/><br/>2. I think that positive feedback is really, really key here.<br/><br/>David Berg once told me that he thinks the most fundamental successful act of roleplaying is this (I'm paraphrasing what he said very loosely):<br/><br/>* Player A makes up something, makes some kind of statement about a fictional reality.<br/><br/>* Other players respond with: "Heck, yeah! That totally happens!/That's exactly how it is!"<br/><br/>The positive feedback there creates an engagement which is tremendously exciting and really, really fun.<br/><br/>If you see two people going:<br/><br/>A - "There's a big monster!"<br/>B - "Oh no! Does it have big teeth?"<br/>A - "Yeah! It has big teeth, like THIS! And really sharp!"<br/>B - "Oh, no! That's scary!"<br/>A - "Yeah, it sure is! Now it growls and acts scary!"<br/>B - "Yikes!"<br/>A - "So what are you going to do!"<br/>B - "I draw my sword and I chop its head off, like THIS!"<br/>A - "Yeah! That's exactly what happens! Its head flies off and it's dead!"<br/>B - "Wow! Yeay! Awesome!"<br/><br/>That exchange will be enough to leave them both smiling and laughing, because each is engaging fully and enthusiastically with everything the other is saying. It's a positive feedback loop which is at the core of successful roleplaying, and, I think, totally fulfilling on its own.<br/><br/>Everything else get layered on top of that, where we go from simple play pretend to more nuanced forms of play where we can create different layers of engagement (challenge, discovery, risk, etc).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_455354">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan" title="AnonAdderlan (Banned)"><img alt="AnonAdderlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan">AnonAdderlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455354/#Comment_455354" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-28T03:09:11+00:00" title="July 28, 2016  3:09AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Perhaps somewhat paradoxically, I'm at my most creative and roleplay most actively <b>when I know that the things I come up with won't "matter" in the grand scheme of the game</b>; this is especially noticeable in heavily procedural games and/or ones that are driven largely by GM agency (or even "railroady" if you prefer to think of it that way).

But the most fundamental act is the acknowledgement of someone else's creative contributions and the willingness to suspend your own disbelief and buy into that shared vision.<br/><br/>As another simple example, if a GM describes a horrible NPC, the most satisfying response is having players buy into that.

It's not about whether you accept the full reality of what the other person is saying, a la "say yes, and" in an improv context. It's that you see their creative input as valid and meaningful. They've added something to the fiction - in a way appropriate to the game being played (could be in-character, out-of-character, or whatever other way) - and you respond to that, by engaging with it fully.<br/><br/>In a traditional "I say what my character does, the GM describes the effects" kind of game, we know implicitly that the player's statement is one of action/intent: my character *tries* to do this, right now. If you say, "I chop his head off!", you know that's crossing the line, and so you're not surprised when there's a little retcon ("Actually, not all the way...").<br/><br/>Where it would break down is if the other party didn't recognize the legitimacy of your statement at all. For instance, I respond with, "Nah. Actually you didn't hit him hard. It was kind a weak, half-assed swing." <br/><br/>What makes the game work is that you've just said something made-up ("My character swings his sword as hard as he can, trying to chop off his head!") and I react by acknowledging that ("Yes! You swing the sword as hard as you can! And you're strong, so, yeah, you totally do that! And it definitely *could* chop off someone's head."). I don't try to undermine your ability to make that statement, but engage with it fully.<br/><br/>It's weird to talk about, because it's so *natural* to us ("how else would you do it?"), but, if you think about it, that's rather a very weird thing. Usually, in everyday life, when people make things up, we *don't* play along. In agreeing to play a roleplaying game, we are quite intentionally engaging in a strange and different way of relating to each other. We are agreeing to deal with untrue, fictional statements as though they had *weight*.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455383">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455383/#Comment_455383" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-29T22:48:05+00:00" title="July 29, 2016 10:48PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brendan,<br/><br/>I can't speak for others, but my comments about "creativity" and such have nothing to do with indie vs. trad. I know that this topic is somewhat about that, but I wasn't looking at it in that way at all.<br/><br/>When you pitch something like a roleplaying game to anyone, lots of people feel like they can't do it, or shouldn't, because they aren't creative enough. That goes just as much for "tell me what the shopkeeper is like!" as it does for "tell me what your character is like!". The distinction there is not meaningful, in my mind. It's meaningful to us, as gamers, but not to Jane Doe-the-receptionist who is trying to understand what a story game/RPG is in the first place. The threshold I'm looking at is the one where a person goes from "I'm a serious adult" to "I'm willing to engage in make-believe", not the one where a person goes from "I'm playing a trad game" to "I'm playing an indie game".<br/><br/>I hope that helps.

It's not even a problem and god's forbid, I never meant to imply there's a root defect of any kind in that person. My point is that I've seen that small issue happen a lot, and it's avoidable using the proper techniques and comunicating clearly those techniques in the rulebook.<br/><br/>-If a person doesn't like story games or trad roleplaying games for any reason, that's good and I'm okey with that, I don't think there's anything wrong with that person. If I'm doubting anything, is if those games are actually well designed/properly explained. <br/><br/>-If a person likes story games or trad roleplaying games but has problems improvising stuff for the game, in my opinion, its for (all those reasons I listed in previous posts) which are meant to be taken as advice; though I admit I've been writing them in a so optimistically positive assertive way that I've probably come out as an asshole. It wasn't my intention, there's probably some language barrier problem from my side here.<br/><br/>-I haven't been able to play nor GM many games that I don't feel like they are well designed, facilitated nor properly explained. I regret missing all those experiences but without knowing anything about how to properly play those games those are doom to misfire with my group, so I'd rather play trad, hack some things of those games and/or make a game of my own.<br/><br/>-When trying to reach the local audience in Peru, a country completely unfamiliar with RPGs or story games I've found out that a good efficient design, a proper explanation of the ritual phrases, body language tricks and things like creativity aids and procedures is a must, hence my opinion of those.<br/><br/>And I'm with Paul, my comments aren't about indie vs. trad either.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455403/#Comment_455403" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-01T15:10:40+00:00" title="August  1, 2016  3:10PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 1, 2016 3:11PM by Airk.">edited August 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wait, wait, what the heck?

There are different kinds of fun.  Eight of them, if I recall correctly. That's science.  Not all of those kinds of fun involve "being creative".   Which is why I feel the assumption that "everyone really wants to be creative, and we're insulting them if we imply or assert otherwise" to be provably false.  You will please note that I am NOT saying that people are "incapable" of being creative, but rather, that they are not INTERESTED in being creative (in fact, I think only ONE of them does).  Much like I COULD go play Overwatch, but I am not INTERESTED in playing Overwatch.  Some people like different things. And I don't care whether that's because tastes are acquired or innate.  They like different things.  And therefore, maybe indie games have targetted a type of fun that doesn't interest as many people as people think.<br/><br/>To answer the "Three Questions" here:<br/><br/>#1: I got interested in roleplaying games because, believe it or not, I read about them in some terrible fantasy novel.  I spent a little time making up my own, but then I managed to talk my parents into buying me the D&amp;D Basic Set.  I don't actually remember what my first "actual" play experience was.<br/>#2: My first (and for a long time, only) RPG was D&amp;D in various forms.  I then subsequently played a few other very traditional RPGs (Vampire, Shadowrun, etc. The usual suspects in this regard).  I became interested in indie RPGs after, I believe, reading a review of Mouse Guard on Gnome Stew, picking it up, finding it awesome, subsequently somehow backing the Tenra Bansho Zero kickstarter, and it was all down hill from there.<br/>#3: Barriers to what? recognize when?  When I first got into the hobby, the only barrier I recognized is that I had no money to buy all these cool things.  Barriers to getting into indie RPGs nowadays?  The major one I see is apathy - most people aren't actually interested in trying new things if the thing they have is "good enough".

I am commenting on an obvious pattern that appears on threads here whenever people talk about more immersive style play. It is almost always framed so that the narrative style is more advanced, more intelligent, more creative, more mature, etc.  What I am trying to tell you is this isn't why people like immersive games. This isn't why people don't like indie or story RPGs. It isn't because they prefer toys. It isn't because they don't want to be creative. It isn't because they are uninterested in complex moral questions or whatever the explanation happens to be. <br/><br/>I play immersive games. I am interested in being creative. I consider it a creative experience. Just because there are constraints on what you can create, that doesn't make it less creative. I realize you may be using 'creative' to describe a style of play where players are more actively creating fictional elements or something. But once again, I am just pointing to the fact that the way it is framed just seems like it is done to elevate indie games and lower others. It just doesn't seem like a genuine attempt to understand. <br/><br/>To me it comes across as a little deliberately obtuse. Like when people call a rulings over rules style "Magic Tea Party" and then act surprised when people take issue with the characterization. Or when you label a whole category of RPG "Toys" rather than "Games". <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455405">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455405/#Comment_455405" name="Item_97" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-01T15:59:46+00:00" title="August  1, 2016  3:59PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote> What I see is a real failure to understand my side of the table, because people are insisting on framing it as an issue of a lack of creativity, a moral failing or as a lack of maturity. Again if you see someone who doesn't like apple pie and prefers ice cream, figuring out 'what is wrong with them' is not going to yield anything of value. You are not going to understand anything about their like of ice cream and their dislike of apple pie if you approach it as discovering some sort of root defect (which is how I think non-story games are being approached in this discussion). </blockquote>\nMy apologies, let me clarify my opinions a bit:<br/><br/>-If my group is playing either a story game or D&amp;D, and either the GM, facilitator or one player is asked to come up with something and she can't, then we're having a small issue. It's not even a problem and god's forbid, I never meant to imply there's a root defect of any kind in that person. My point is that I've seen that small issue happen a lot, and it's avoidable using the proper techniques and comunicating clearly those techniques in the rulebook.<br/><br/>-If a person doesn't like story games or trad roleplaying games for any reason, that's good and I'm okey with that, I don't think there's anything wrong with that person. If I'm doubting anything, is if those games are actually well designed/properly explained. <br/><br/>-If a person likes story games or trad roleplaying games but has problems improvising stuff for the game, in my opinion, its for (all those reasons I listed in previous posts) which are meant to be taken as advice; though I admit I've been writing them in a so optimistically positive assertive way that I've probably come out as an asshole. It wasn't my intention, there's probably some language barrier problem from my side here.<br/><br/>-I haven't been able to play nor GM many games that I don't feel like they are well designed, facilitated nor properly explained. I regret missing all those experiences but without knowing anything about how to properly play those games those are doom to misfire with my group, so I'd rather play trad, hack some things of those games and/or make a game of my own.<br/><br/>-When trying to reach the local audience in Peru, a country completely unfamiliar with RPGs or story games I've found out that a good efficient design, a proper explanation of the ritual phrases, body language tricks and things like creativity aids and procedures is a must, hence my opinion of those.<br/><br/>And I'm with Paul, my comments aren't about indie vs. trad either.<br/></blockquote>\nI have to admit  I am a little confused by your post. But I just want to restate, I am responding to the thread, and threads like this in general. Unless I am mistaken the question being resolved is why Indie Games are having trouble going mainstream. And I am assuming what mainstream means in this case is games like D&amp;D versus games like Fiasco or something. <br/><br/>This is the sort of thing I was pointing to: \n<blockquote>1. Games like Fiasco, Baron Munchausen, A Penny for Your Thoughts, etc, they look like they can really "put you on the spot".<br/>"Here, be creative, right now! Lest ye be judged!"<br/><br/>This is scary. I'm not saying whether or not it really is that difficult to create on the spot. Maybe it's not, maybe it is. But. It looks difficult and it looks like you'll be judged and found inadequate.</blockquote>\nI am suggesting, people who don't play Fiasco, Baron Munchausen, Penny for Your Thoughts, etc we are not avoiding them because we are scared to be creative on the spot. Even if we are talking about people who play just dictionary or scrabble, I don't think the issue is a lack of interest in being creative (frankly I find that a really strange conclusion to draw). If we are just talking about why people don't play RPGs in general, over things like mainstream boardgames, then I would say there are probably a bunch of other reasons, and few of them have to do with a lack of creativity. I know plenty of creative people, who love creative games and pastimes, who don't like RPGs. If we are talking about the divide between indie RPGs and mainstream RPGs, I would say the same thing. It isn't a lack of creativity or a lack of interest in being creative that is causing me to not want to play fiasco, and instead play D&amp;D.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455406/#Comment_455406" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-01T16:02:40+00:00" title="August  1, 2016  4:02PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 1, 2016 4:14PM by Airk.">edited August 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm afraid I don't get it.

Right now it seems more like you who are looking down and sneering at people who prefer competition to creativity? (To cite only one of several different other forms of fun.)  Because you have decided that creativity is somehow better than the other forms of fun and that obviously everyone should want to do it.<br/><br/>That is exactly what I posited as the fallacy here: Not everyone wants to do it.  It doesn't mean there is anything wrong with those people, it just means that different people like different things.  I don't like FPS games.  But many people regard them as the best games ever.   There is nothing wrong with me for not liking them.  There is nothing wrong with people who don't want to engage creatively for their fun.  That's just not the kind of fun they want, for whatever reason. And that's OK.  Creative fun isn't "better" than any other kind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455407">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jangler" title="jangler"><img alt="jangler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jangler">jangler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455407/#Comment_455407" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-01T16:22:41+00:00" title="August  1, 2016  4:22PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A lot of this seems pretty straw doll to me, <a href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">@Bedrockbrendan</a>.

Saying someone doesn't want to be creative in that case, was an insult, and it was a comforting explanation for me, the fantasy and RPG enthusiast, but it completely failed to understand why they were not interested. These sorts of explanations are comforting to us, because they take something we value and suggest we have it, or have interest in it, in spades. But I see no reason to believe it is a lack of interest in being creative that would lead someone to not play D&amp;D. <br/><br/>I am not sneering at anyone. I haven't said anything at all about competitive play (which I think involves creativity as well).

But even if it is, we don't know that this is why people are playing Candyland and not playing pretend. Let's say Candyland is 40% creative and pretend if 80% creative, that doesn't necessarily have anything to do with why Candyland is getting played. <br/><br/>Because the analysis here seems to be that the reason people don't make the jump to Indie RPGs from Traditional RPGs, or from Traditional games to RPGs (it is a bit unclear to me what line is being drawn around Indie in this case), is they are having difficulty bridging the creativity gap. I've personally never encountered this. Not once. What I have encountered is stuff like being shy, or thinking it is really weird to pretend to be an elf. But I've never met someone who due to a lack of interest in being creative or lack of actual creativity, wouldn't or couldn't play an RPG (indie or mainstream). <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455411/#Comment_455411" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-01T17:25:49+00:00" title="August  1, 2016  5:25PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote> I think we may though have a fundamental disagreement over fun breaks down (I am not particularly enamored for example with a lot of the models I see people throwing around here, and I am quite skeptical of labeling them "science!".

I don't know that I would use 'science' to describe that. \n<blockquote>But it sounds to me like you are still somehow resisting the idea that different people like different things and that "creativity" (in and of itself an absurdly, uselessly broad term) can be one of them.<br/></blockquote>\nI am not resistant to the idea that people like different things. Nor am I resistant to the idea that people like creative things. I am resistant to self serving explanations that claim to read the minds of people we don't know. \n<blockquote>Certainly, one is forced to produce different kinds of creative contributions in highly traditional versus highly "indie" games, so it seems not unreasonable to submit that some people might prefer not to do one some of these things.</blockquote>\nI am still not convinced this is anything but a self serving argument. I don't think we have any agreement on how much creativity is involved in traditional versus indie games, but even if we did, we have no reason to believe that is the factor driving interest in one and not the other. I certainly don't think a lack of interest in creative play is what is causing people not to adopt indie games (even if people who play them find that they satisfy a creative itch). It is basically an argument that says " I like playing indie games because they let me be creative, these people who don't play indie games must not like being creative." \n<blockquote>I'm also not sure what you are referring to when you say "creativity gap" - I think you are the only one who believes that anyone thinks there is such a thing.  </blockquote>\nWhat you are guys are describing is a creativity gap between those who play traditional games and those who play indie games. I just gave it a word. But this whole thread is trying to figure out why indies are not mainstream and offers as a solution that people who play traditional games are not interested in a creative activity. So in this explanation there is a creativity gap between the people who play indie games and the people who don't. <br/><br/>My point is, this is the toy thread all over again, with new skin. It is the same fundamental problem of analyzing peoples likes and preferences in a way that gives people here comfort (because absolutely being creative and being interested in creative activities is considered a positive thing). If I say you are not creative, can't be creative or have no interest in being creative, that isn't just a statement of fact, that is a judgment. Creativity is a skill. You could just as easily make this about intelligence. Clearly a complex game like 3.5 requires greater intelligence than a simple game like Fiasco. Obviously people who play fiasco are not interested in intelligent play. This isn't a commentary on anyone's preferences, or meant to inflate the ego of 3.5 players, it is just a fact that there are different types of play. Intelligent play is merely one form. Not everyone is into intelligent play and that is okay.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455413">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455413/#Comment_455413" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-01T18:49:44+00:00" title="August  1, 2016  6:49PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 1, 2016 7:01PM by Airk.">edited August 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have no dog in this fight, and I have not done anything other than offer a single hypothesis, which you seem to regard as completely implausible without offering any sort of reasons why, other than that you don't like what you think I am implying.<br/><br/>I don't see how creativity being a skill is relevant.

It just seems odd to me that this is the skill we are choosing as the dividing point between indie and mainstream. And, perhaps most importantly, I don't think anyone has demonstrated a connection in any meaningful way (other than saying again and again, game x involves greater creativity, so people not interested in game X are not interest or as interested in creative play). There are huge chunks of logic missing there. And I am just very skeptical overall of the way it is being framed around creativity (and a fear of being creative) because this seems so self serving. \n<blockquote>Your Fiasco argument isn't bad, but you're deliberately choosing a reductive stance:<br/>Clearly a complex game like 3.5 requires greater attention to detail than a simple game like Fiasco.

And the fact that you can reframe it as an attention to detail, shows how this word choice comes into play. That the words you are choosing to come up with an explanation for why indie games are not mainstream, is done to enhance the ego of the indie gamer. And again, perhaps most importantly, neither of these arguments explain interest in 3.5 or fiasco. There is no reason to conclude people play fiasco because it is less detailed than 3.5. It happens to be less detailed in terms of rules than 3.5, but I don't think this is what is driving people to 3.5 and away from fiasco.

You are assuming because you think that creativity is a feature of the Indie RPG or the RPG, that this means the thing preventing people from playing it is that creativity is too hard (or pick your talent). First problem with this, is there is a very good chance, creativity isn't the thing setting it apart. But even if it is, it is still far form certain that creativity is the thing preventing people from wanting to play. I think we should naturally be suspicious of explanations that scratch our own egos (and absolutely, identifying a game as being creative and for creative people scratches our egos). <br/><br/>My issue here is you are trying to solve the problem by starting with assumptions like the people you want to pull in are lacking the creative interest, the intellectual ability or some other positive trait to enjoy the game that you enjoy. It just seems obvious to me that your analysis of what it takes to enjoy an indie game is probably colored by the fact that you consider yourself an intelligent or creative person. Again, I would point to the toy discussions again. I think there is a lot of taking and coming up with terms and language in this thread. But I don't think any of it is arriving at an understanding of what is going on and why people are not playing indie games.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455417">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455417/#Comment_455417" name="Item_109" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-01T20:03:41+00:00" title="August  1, 2016  8:03PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/><br/>Now, are we that wrong to offer those people advice and game designs that would help them overcome that barrier?

But you are describing a problem I've never seen or encountered. What I think is kind of weird is you are just declaring that people who like mainstream games but not indie games, the core problem must be one of a creativity deficit. <br/><br/>And again, I do have to point out, this seems oddly similar to the whole traditional RPGs as toys rather than games argument (the one where it was stated traditional RPGs fail as games but succeed as toys). My honest opinion at this point is this kind of thinking is almost a reflect at this point. But none of you have figured out what makes traditional RPG folk or mainstream gamers tick I think (and I believe because its always framed as something being wrong with them, that they lack something you posses---whether it is maturity, intellect, creativity, etc). And since none of you have figured it out, maybe it stands to reason your explanations (whether by analogy or seeking root causes) are incorrect?                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455418/#Comment_455418" name="Item_110" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-01T20:24:20+00:00" title="August  1, 2016  8:24PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are a lot of wires getting crossed here.<br/><br/>Some people are talking about, "Why aren't more people who aren't gamers ["mainstream audience"] attracted to indie RPGs?"<br/><br/>Some other people - notably Bedrockbrendan - are talking about, "Why aren't more trad gamers ["mainstream audience"] attracted to indie RPGs?"<br/><br/>I'd recommend anyone posting clarify which they mean. <br/><br/>For instance, when I mentioned that "lack of creativity" is a <i>perceived problem</i> (note: it's the stated attitude of people I'm talking about, not their actual skills), I was very much talking about the first question.

They both position the thing we like as being naturally more for people who are creatively inclined. That is a positive quality and I am naturally suspicious of the explanation because it lowers the people we are talking about, while elevating ourselves (and it is the same argument I used to use at age 14 when I met people who didn't want to play RPGs). When I was 14 and used this argument, it did nothing to help me gain players because the problem wasn't a lack of interest in being creative. It was something much more complex. If you begin with the assumption that the people you are trying to win over are not playing your super creative games because they lack super creativity, I don't think you'll ever figure out how to win over substantial numbers of them. <br/><br/>Also this is a diagnosis that naturally leads to a reduction in quality of the thing you like, for the very reason you believe you like it. If the problem is the games are super creative and people can't handle that. One obvious solution is to make the games less super creative so just marginally creative people can handle them. So if you've misdiagnosed the problem, you've also set yourself up to make the situation (not enough people playing our super creative games) even worse.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455421">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455421/#Comment_455421" name="Item_112" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-01T21:02:10+00:00" title="August  1, 2016  9:02PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 1, 2016 9:04PM by Airk.">edited August 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>For instance, when I mentioned that "lack of creativity" is a <i>perceived problem</i> (note: it's the stated attitude of people I'm talking about, not their actual skills), I was very much talking about the first question.

Calm down, I'm not the enemy nor such a shallow egotistic person. I dunno how come I ended coming up like that but my apologies if I did. Ok, first mistake: you're assuming too much that I'm assuming too many things.<br/><br/>I'm saying that the problem is that text in story games (and in lots of trad games) is hard to undestand quickly. Difficulty is actually less important. I'm not a number oriented person so I probably wouldn't be able to GM Rollmaster, but most of the rules are clear there. And if you learn somewhere the procedures to come up with adventures and such you're good to go.<br/><br/>My opinion is specifically about difficulty on the creativity side, but I'm not saying that's the only problem at all. We've been discussing other issues along the thread, I just dropped here because it wasn't mentioned before and I consider it important too.<br/><br/>So please, take note, I'm saying that creativity is an issue <i>sometimes</i>, for <i>some</i> people. Not for everyone, not all the time, not like a final point and more like my opinion than like an absolute truth.<br/><br/>That aside, I don't play story games. I play D&amp;D and made lots of hacks of my own using pieces of trad games and story games. I write a bit but I'm not a pro. I make comics and have been making them for 26 years. I've trained myself to come up with stuff on a daily basis either for work and for leisure. And yet I can't play story games for my dear life. I get blankpaged, I froze, I feel like I'm improvising sub-par half-assed content. Just the idea of playing that way stresses me out. So you can stop telling me lack of creativity isn't a problem for <i>some</i> people, it's an actual problem for me and last time I checked on the mirror, I was a person too. I'm giving you that also, last time I checked on the streets I wasn't the only person in the world and lots of those other people weren't playing trad nor SG games. That's what I'm saying it's one of many issues both SG and trad games have. \n<blockquote><br/>My issue here is you are trying to solve the problem by starting with assumptions like the people you want to pull in are lacking the creative interest, the intellectual ability or some other positive trait to enjoy the game that you enjoy.

I think they are enjoyed by people who like SG. Same with traditional RPGs. I don't think liking one over the other reveals much about intelligence, maturity, etc. <br/><br/>I think we have a fundamental disagreement here about what explanation can achieve. Maybe you don't like story games because they haven't been described properly to you. I am of the belief that I don't play them because they just are not to my taste and no amount of explaining is going to change that anymore than I can explain wuxia to someone until they are interested in the genre. There is always a little gulf that can be bridged (i.e. someone genuinely doesn't understand something and you explaining it helps them decide if its is something they want to do). But if you really just don't like SGs, I don't see how someone offering yet another explanation is going to open the door to you enjoying them. <br/><br/>In terms of the forum. I am not saying everyone here has a stick up their butt and nose in the air. But threads like the one I linked to, and to an extent this one, are very much about having an attitude of one style being superior to another. If you are describing another style of play, particularly one that has some history of being in opposition to SGs, as being more about playing with toys than engaging a game, that is pretty obviously more than just an objective analysis. Again, it is like the Magic Tea Party critique. To act like it is a fairly innocent and inconsequential characterization is odd. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455425">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455425/#Comment_455425" name="Item_116" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-01T22:11:54+00:00" title="August  1, 2016 10:11PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/><br/>No, damnit, not "deficit";  This is getting absurd.

It seems clear to me that you are wedded to the idea that not only is there inherent merit in creative stuff, but that anyone who would miss a chance to be creative ever is clearly wasting their time.  And then you accuse me of judging others.  Too much hypocrisy in that reading for me.  Bowing out.</blockquote>\nAgain, I think people are trying to have it both ways. If I swap 'creative' with 'intellectual' it is clear we are not just talking about what people are interested in engaging in a particular moment, but also kind of characterizing those people (because if you are consistently drawn to an activity that is more creative, obviously you are saying this is an activity for creative people, and those are put off by the creative aspect are likely not as creative---or at least the games they prefer aren't as creative). Creative does have a connotation of something good. So I just can't let this point go because it is part of a longstanding pattern here (and one where I've been very consistent in my criticism). Every time an explanation is sought after for why people are not playing the games people here like, it is always framed in this way, and I really do think that is missing the point. You keep asserting this about one game being creative, and that is apparently the draw. But I am just not seeing the evidence for it. <br/><br/>I am a bit confused about where you see hypocrisy here. I never said anyone who would ever miss a chance to be creative is wasting their time. Nor did I say there is inherit merit in creating stuff. I said it is obviously a value judgment to say "x is a creative activity". <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455426/#Comment_455426" name="Item_117" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-01T22:13:13+00:00" title="August  1, 2016 10:13PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/><br/>I just want to say, for the record, that I didn't say "lack of creativity" I said "not interested in being creative"  This is the difference between "can't do a thing" and "doesn't want to, for whatever reason, possibly including doing that thing all day and not wanting to do it for leisure."</blockquote>\nLack of creativity, or lack of interest in creative activities...to me these largely amount to the same kind of judgment. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455427">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455427/#Comment_455427" name="Item_118" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-01T22:20:32+00:00" title="August  1, 2016 10:20PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 1, 2016 10:29PM by WarriorMonk.">edited August 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seriously, stop making assumptions about what I like and dislike.<br/><br/>I like story games, even though I don't get them.

It boils down to declaring why people like or don't like something, rather than simply asking them. <br/>\n<blockquote><br/>I already akcnowledged a lots of posts ago (and repeated several times) that yes, people has different tastes, that you do and<b> I'm okey with that</b>.

And I am not saying there won't be individual cases of people who feel they can't engage something due to not knowing how to be creative with it, or not being creative. But that isn't what this thread is about. The thesis of the thread is this is one of the core issues preventing interest in indie games. This is part of an ongoing thread series where there have been numerous attempts to understand this. And I am saying so long as people make these kinds of assumptions (i.e. indie games are creative, people who don't play them must not be interested in playing a creative game), that quest to understand is doomed to failure. It is like a guy who is handsome and can't get girlfriends reaching the conclusion that women must just be into ugly guys and they simply can't handle his beauty. It is obvious to any outside observer that is not the problem. He is seeking an explanation that expands his ego but doesn't really discover what is going on. \n<blockquote>What I want to do is to explain them better to people who do find them interesting but don't dare play them because they don't get them. People like me.</blockquote>\nExplaining the games better is fine. That isn't what this thread is about though. This thread is about why indie games are not meeting mainstream success. There is a thread about why that is, people offer something as a core explanation. Then when I challenge that explanation and the assumptions behind it, I feel like people do this dance where we are suddenly talking about something else. I am not taking issue with people explaining Story Games better. I don't think that failure to explain them, or failure to explain indie games, is a core issue, but I certainly understand there are players out there who might not have an adequate understanding of them to enjoy them. That isn't what I am taking issue with. \n<blockquote>What I'm saying is useful to the discussion, even if it's just a small help. What you're saying isn't, because there's no way I will convince people to play something they don't like at all.

I think what I am saying is very useful because we have had multiple threads on this topic and people are no closer to understanding the issue. I think it is because the assumptions at work are seriously flawed.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455429">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455429/#Comment_455429" name="Item_120" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-01T23:17:25+00:00" title="August  1, 2016 11:17PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, it seems that for now it's the two of us.

I wasn't saying one is better than the other, and I wasn't saying mainstream games were better than RPGs, or vice versa. I was saying this whole conversation is flawed from the outset because no one is really trying to understand things on their own terms, and the real reasons people come to them. Yourself excluded, I honestly don't believe that people either having trouble being creative, or having a lack of interest in being creative, is a big reason why folks are not playing RPGs in general, or story games in particular. And I think an analysis that begins with that is visibly self serving. It is just obvious. Like I said, this conversation sounds like the guy who can't get dates, chocking it up to women being overwhelmed by his beauty. Or to use another example it is like being a Star Trek fan and deciding people who don't like star trek just aren't as smart or benevolent as you (because you think it is a smart franchise with a compassionate message). This is partisan thinking. Not a serious attempt to understand. <br/><br/>When people don't express interest in something, the problem is almost never that it has too much of a good quality. What I am saying is if you are going to try to figure out why your average gamers are not getting into indie games, treat their lack of interest seriously, don't assume that just because you see story games or indie games as a creative exercise that that has anything to do with their lack of interest (because it probably doesn't). And if there are people among them who you can win over, you are not going to do it if you go in assuming things like it is because they are not terribly creative (or interested in a creative activity).                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455435">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455435/#Comment_455435" name="Item_122" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-02T03:15:35+00:00" title="August  2, 2016  3:15AM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, neither you nor me think that the problem is that people doesn't play RPGs nor story games for lack of creativity.

And I'm not talking about lack of author stance or any such bullshit, I'm talking about cool action descriptions and inter-character dialog being marginalized with such statements like "can we please get back to the <i>game</i>?"<br/><br/>Whether this had more to do with the group I cannot say, but then why did they adopt the systems they did?\n<blockquote>I'm also not sure what you are referring to when you say "creativity gap" - I think you are the only one who believes that anyone thinks there is such a thing.</blockquote>\nHe is, and fighting a battle where it doesn't exist...\n<blockquote>What you are guys are describing is a creativity gap between those who play traditional games and those who play indie games.

Clearly a complex game like 3.5 requires greater intelligence than a simple game like Fiasco. Obviously people who play fiasco are not interested in intelligent play. This isn't a commentary on anyone's preferences, or meant to inflate the ego of 3.5 players, it is just a fact that there are different types of play. Intelligent play is merely one form. Not everyone is into intelligent play and that is okay.</blockquote>\nAnd guess what? There are people who avoid 'intelligent' games because they're afraid of looking stupid. Being smart on the spot is just as stressful as being creative on the spot, and in RPGs as they're usually one and the same.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%23PlotTwist&amp;Mode=like">#PlotTwist</a><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455438">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455438/#Comment_455438" name="Item_124" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-02T08:52:45+00:00" title="August  2, 2016  8:52AM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 2, 2016 9:09AM by Potemkin.">edited August 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Congratulations, gentlemen*, you've now said "creativity" so much it now means nothing.<br/><br/>Assuming it ever it meant anything to begin with.

Keep in mind there are lots of posters here expressing slightly different explanations. The explanations offered here on this thread range from people not being creative enough, people not being interested in being creative to people believing they are not creative enough. So I am trying to be as broad as I can in addressing the point. But....<br/><br/>This is literally the only place I've ever encountered anyone saying they are not creative enough to participate in the hobby. I am not saying you aren't having these experiences, but I genuinely doubt that this is at all a substantial reason why people are not playing RPGs. I don't think it is at all wide spread. And I don't think it really answers the questions posed on this thread: why are indie RPGs having a hard time finding mainstream success. I've literally never encountered anyone who said to me "I am not creative enough to do that". I've met lots of people who say I don't that because I prefer something else. I've never met a mainstream gamers who said, I am just not creative enough for this type of game (except here). In cases where that is a problem, sure go ahead and tell people how to be creative. I just really, truly do not believe that this the thing (or even a thing) that is preventing people in large enough numbers to matter from shifting from mainstream games to RPGs (or from mainstream RPGs to indie game RPGs or story games).                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455451">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455451/#Comment_455451" name="Item_129" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-02T15:40:43+00:00" title="August  2, 2016  3:40PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>First tell me what you mean exactly by indie games.

In my lifetime there have been two big booms (the one in the 70s and early 80s, which started before I was actually gaming) and the d20 boom. There was also a huge surge of interest around vampire, which seemed to get a lot of players who might not typically be interested in D&amp;D. But both these games involved in the booms are pretty mainstream in terms of RPG mechanics. I don't think the issue is mechanical. Nor do I think its an issue of explanation (the pitches for both these games when I encountered them was fairly straight forward and simple: Play a vampire! Explore a fantasy world and dungeon!). I was never confused about what D&amp;D was all about, nor was anyone I knew who didn't play. Part of it I think is just catching cultural waves (Lord of the Rings came out around the d20 boom, Vampire came out around a vampire movie craze and the late 70s early 80s was a pretty good period for fantasy and science fiction movies). Geek stuff is going pretty mainstream though now, so maybe we are in the midst of a rising tide of interest for all I know (or on the cusp). <br/><br/>Also, I don't know what the data is on RPGs and their level of popularity. I've heard lots of different ideas, and have some hunches of my own, but I have to confess to not knowing how far away table top RPGs are at the moment from being mainstream. <br/><br/>I think there is the added complexity of the rise of online RPGs. These probably satisfy some of the needs of people who might otherwise be interested in table top RPGs. <br/><br/>I guess a more vital question to me is why do we need mainstream success? Why is that important? Maybe RPGs are just a fringe hobby with a popularity that naturally waxes and wanes. I'm having plenty of fun playing them as they are right now. <br/><br/>If there is a barrier though, it is probably the increasingly complex vocabulary gamers use to describe gaming.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455454/#Comment_455454" name="Item_131" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-02T16:08:10+00:00" title="August  2, 2016  4:08PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 2, 2016 4:28PM by Bedrockbrendan.">edited August 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>If you mean that we should look at what people want and design from there, nope, sorry, that model is outdated.

Right now the most successful RPG out there is D&amp;D (whether it is the form of 5E or Pathfinder). Lots of games seem to meet with success emulating D&amp;D and other traditional RPGs. <br/><br/>But what is wrong with giving people what they want? I think there isn't a problem with giving gamers what they want, as long as it is what you want to design, and as long as you go in understanding tables are not made up of a single player but of five or more players, often with different tastes and preferences. You can drive yourself crazy though if you misunderstand what people want (or read too much into things like online comments---as happened with 4E). That is the issue: misidentifying what people want. It isn't giving them what they want (if a gaming company gives me what I want, I am happy). It also doesn't mean don't give them something new and exciting. I also think you can end up with problems if you are just going down a list of wants and supplying them.  A game needs some spark and passion to work I believe. The designer should have a genuine interest in it and play it regularly.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455458">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455458/#Comment_455458" name="Item_132" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-02T19:01:34+00:00" title="August  2, 2016  7:01PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now that's useful!

On early 00s we started getting a space on the retro-hipster culture, hence obscure indie trad and story games becoming more popular.

Here in my country you can't easily find any info about D&amp;D nor RPGs. Sure, there's internet, but without knowing what to google, how would people find out? I didn't found out until by sheer luck I found people who played the game. I didn't got it the first time I saw it, how would you expect me to convince my friends to play it then? Even If I had understood the basics the first time I saw it in play, my friends didn't had no reference that I could use to explain. Zero. Total information absence. <br/><br/>And today it's still the same, even after lots of people saw people plaing D&amp;D on The Big Bang Theory show. Even after most people of my generation here saw the Dungeons &amp; Dragons cartoon in TV, they never realized it was based on a game, nor there's a single clue on the cartoon about how the game could be played. So get it through: even if it never happened to you, it happened to me, it happened to lots of people here in the forum, it happened and it's still happening in my country. Common people don't know how RPGs are played. We already agree that the game itself isn't hard to learn for common people. Most of us are common people and still enjoy the heck out of the game. What is failing? publicity. Part of it is a lack of a proper quick explanation. Sure, you got people's curiosity picked with the pitch. But how's "Play a vampire! Explore a fantasy world and dungeon!" any different from play pretend or videogames and why should I pay you money for that?. Well, as a buyer you explanation is still lacking, and if I'll only get it after reading the whole rulebook, you totally lost me as a client. That's why most people who gets into the hobbie still does so through friends who learned from other friends. And Story Games fall into that pit too.\n<blockquote><br/>I think there is the added complexity of the rise of online RPGs.

Then you see the gameplay video, where your character is a vampire, explores a fantasy world and dungeons. Boom, take my money! It's all explained itself. By now we all know what videogames are about. I'll give you that videogames have been there longer than tabletop RPGs, but the difference in popularity is still too huge. \n<blockquote><br/>I guess a more vital question to me is why do we need mainstream success?

Still this doesn't explain a lack of mainstream adoption in a place like the US, where people know about the game. \n<blockquote>And today it's still the same, even after lots of people saw people plaing D&amp;D on The Big Bang Theory show. Even after most people of my generation here saw the Dungeons &amp; Dragons cartoon in TV, they never realized it was based on a game, nor there's a single clue on the cartoon about how the game could be played. So get it through: even if it never happened to you, it happened to me, it happened to lots of people here in the forum, it happened and it's still happening in my country. Common people don't know how RPGs are played. We already agree that the game itself isn't hard to learn for common people. Most of us are common people and still enjoy the heck out of the game. What is failing? publicity. Part of it is a lack of a proper quick explanation. Sure, you got people's curiosity picked with the pitch. But how's "Play a vampire! Explore a fantasy world and dungeon!" any different from play pretend or videogames and why should I pay you money for that?. Well, as a buyer you explanation is still lacking, and if I'll only get it after reading the whole rulebook, you totally lost me as a client. That's why most people who gets into the hobbie still does so through friends who learned from other friends. And Story Games fall into that pit too.</blockquote>\nI think the books have gotten pretty good at explaining what play consists of. Perhaps more publicity would help. If it were 1989 and we were all going by the 2E PHB (which is really the one time I think there was a gap in explaining how play works---at least from the GM side), I think that might make sense. I don't know. But again, publicity is very expensive, and I think part of what is going on is the bigger companies that make these games realize there is a point of diminishing returns on that front because the hobby is probably only going to attract so many people. <br/><br/>But I really don't think this is what is preventing RPGs from going mainstream. Finding a group to play with certainly could be an issue. But I don't see it is a problem of explanation because the explanations of play, from my point of view, are pretty good these days. I think the only time you run into big issues there is when explanations rely on jargon that people outside the hobby don't understand. <br/><br/>The core of a traditional RPG is pretty simple though. The GM describes what is going on and the players say what they want to try do. And each RPG will handle how that is resolved mechanically in its own way. The hardest part I think is breaking down how to prep for gamemasters. At least on the traditional side. But now there is a wealth of material available for people just starting out. <br/><br/>\n<blockquote>"Play a vampire! Explore a fantasy world and dungeon!" Then you see the gameplay video, where your character is a vampire, explores a fantasy world and dungeons. Boom, take my money! It's all explained itself. By now we all know what videogames are about. I'll give you that videogames have been there longer than tabletop RPGs, but the difference in popularity is still too huge. </blockquote>\nWell, video games have the advantage that they are automated. But table top RPGs have the advantage that they are run by humans who can be flexible and adapt to what is going on in the game (a video game will have things you can't do, no matter how reasonable they seem, whereas a table top you can try to do just about anything). I think even if we automated RPGs somehow, most of the people who just play video games would still play them. There are probably different reasons behind why people go to each one (I don't really play video games myself, so I don't know that I can really shed much light on this one either). <br/><br/><br/>\n<blockquote>We need to strive for better. Well, not you, but some of us do. You don't need to help us, we don't need to disturb you, but why shall we not try?</blockquote>\nThat doesn't answer the question I asked: Why is mainstream success so important? Is it even attainable for RPGs? Do we even know how close we are to mainstream success (for all I know, RPGs have mainstream success). I'd be interested in the numbers here. <br/><br/>\n<blockquote>And finally you said it yourself. Roleplayers keep making the game harder to explain.</blockquote>\nNot all role-players. Only some. Particularly those engaged in online discussions. I guess what I am getting at is, maybe part of the problem for things like story games, is the fanbase grows out of the forge, which was pretty jargon heavy. I've literally had conversations with people who came out of that environment and didn't understand a single word they said. So I think there may be a lingering effect there and that could be a hurdle for some story RPGs. With traditional RPGs I think that is less of an issue because the jargon hasn't grown that much (there may be terms people use when talking about play online, but these are not usually requirements for understanding the rules).                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455460/#Comment_455460" name="Item_134" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-02T19:39:32+00:00" title="August  2, 2016  7:39PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/> I am saying we should connect people with existing games that meet what they want, and if existing games don't meet their wants and needs, then why should we force the issue?<br/></blockquote>\nAww, come on, I wanted to be a game designer!

And if they did want some fixes, they were likely relatively minor tweaks, not huge changes. What made them successful was understanding what the fanbase wanted better than WOTC understood it (and WOTC at the time was making a serious effort to advance the design to achieve more mainstream success). I think one of the lessons of 4E is that, maybe, there is really only so much room to grow, and the hobby can't grow if the games are not meeting the needs or interests of the people playing them. That doesn't mean there isn't room for innovation or fringe games. But it does mean you don't take the flagship brand and turn it on its head, when there are lots of people who are satisfied with it. Another lesson people learned was, we don't really need WOTC or a big company. People were able to make their own version of D&amp;D with a good deal of success, often meeting a very precise set of preferences. <br/><br/>And I should point out, right now I am not playing D&amp;D. I am running two non-D&amp;D campaigns.

The organization may have been a little unusual, but since it was a first go at an advanced edition, I can't really fault it with that (I've always found my organization to improve incrementally). In about 2004-05 I went back and read 1E DMG thoroughly, because I was dissatisfied with a lot of the 3E GM advice at the time and found myself not liking the way GMs were encouraged to structure adventures during the 3E period. I was pretty struck by how it quite clearly told you everything you needed to do to prep and run a game. It was pretty tailored toward a particular way of playing, but if you followed that advice, running an exploration based campaign was pretty easy. <br/><br/>Second edition was the one that had the big issue when it came to GM advice, and I think there were a lot of reasons why. You had to buy a bunch of the blue books to get a really complete picture. <br/><br/>I think if you are interested in ways to reduce rolls, increase role-play, and improve adjudication of action, you might want to look up rulings over rules discussions on forums favorable to the OSR.

It was on purpose, no conspiracy theories here, the dictatorial government here in the 90's institutionalized yellow press and crap TV as smokescreens and ways to sway public opinion. Almost all of them were on their payroll. It was blatant and up to the date we haven't been able to trust too much again on the mainstream press. The entertainment industry in my country is but slowly recovering from all that. <br/><br/>We didn't had Cons until 2008 and we still have nothing of USA like level where stars and companies from all over the country mount a show. We're still far from that. We ain't got specialized tabletop RPG cons yet, only tabletop gaming ones where RPGs get a couple of tables. All is organized by fans, no actual companies participate there.<br/><br/>And that phrase, exactly that phrase "give people what they want" was the motto of trash press here, famous/important press people were dropping that phrase all the time these years. I hope you get now why you won't even convince me by using it.<br/><br/>On top of that, I draw comics, I mentioned this before. The first gig I had for that industry here was in a small publisher. I started drawing a comic of my own that was meant to be included in their trimestral anthology. The owner however had the same vision: give the people what they want. On those days that meant that even artists who didn't knew well how to draw anime, had to make anime. I could handle, but most of the other stuff on the magazine ended up looking weird. Forced. People who were into anime didn't felt it was anime like. People who liked more of a classical comic style felt it was too anime-like. It didn't sell good. So then the owner said "since we ought to keep giving people what they want, let's give them porn!". So I ended up drawing porn. It's definitely not my thing. And it wasn't either anybody's thing there. It showed in the product. And it showed on the sales. The company never published again, I went to work as a freelancer and vowed I'd never again draw a single page with that phrase in mind.<br/><br/>That being said, I don't think of myself as an artist.

The organization may have been a little unusual, but since it was a first go at an advanced edition, I can't really fault it with that (I've always found my organization to improve incrementally). In about 2004-05 I went back and read 1E DMG thoroughly, because I was dissatisfied with a lot of the 3E GM advice at the time and found myself not liking the way GMs were encouraged to structure adventures during the 3E period. I was pretty struck by how it quite clearly told you everything you needed to do to prep and run a game. It was pretty tailored toward a particular way of playing, but if you followed that advice, running an exploration based campaign was pretty easy. <br/><br/>Second edition was the one that had the big issue when it came to GM advice, and I think there were a lot of reasons why. You had to buy a bunch of the blue books to get a really complete picture. <br/></blockquote>\nI still have to read more 1e books myself then, though when I tried to understand 2e from a manual a friend handed me, I got a headache and couldn't get anything at all. Perhaps I'm too used to later explanations and that's why I feel like even these are still lacking a bit.\n<blockquote><br/>I think if you are interested in ways to reduce rolls, increase role-play, and improve adjudication of action, you might want to look up rulings over rules discussions on forums favorable to the OSR. There is a lot of helpful advice in those quarters. </blockquote>\nYou know, I still believe that those rulings should actually be part of the rulebook, it's like a completely different game experience once the GM and the players get used to all those small tricks, rulings, questions, ritual phrases and such. No trad game tells the GM to ask "<i>and exactly how you do that?</i>" to the players after they explain their actions, and yet this stupid simple trick totally changes how combat goes and how the GM narrates the outcomes, turning rollplay into roleplay. It can even help players forego rolls completely. How come it isn't part of the rules?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455471">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455471/#Comment_455471" name="Item_142" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-02T23:05:28+00:00" title="August  2, 2016 11:05PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><br/><br/>Don't get me started.

Praise the lord for internet, DVDs, Cable TV and Netfix, otherwise I would be totally insane. But that shit is what people want. If they don't know better stuff, they won't ask for better stuff.<br/></blockquote>\nBut this is just a case of you being unsatisfied as a customer because you are not getting what you want. The problem isn't giving people what they want, it is that people who want what you do are being neglected by people producing media content in your country. <br/></blockquote>\nIt's far worse than neglected. It was on purpose, no conspiracy theories here, the dictatorial government here in the 90's institutionalized yellow press and crap TV as smokescreens and ways to sway public opinion. Almost all of them were on their payroll. It was blatant and up to the date we haven't been able to trust too much again on the mainstream press. The entertainment industry in my country is but slowly recovering from all that. <br/><br/>We didn't had Cons until 2008 and we still have nothing of USA like level where stars and companies from all over the country mount a show. We're still far from that. We ain't got specialized tabletop RPG cons yet, only tabletop gaming ones where RPGs get a couple of tables. All is organized by fans, no actual companies participate there.<br/><br/>And that phrase, exactly that phrase "give people what they want" was the motto of trash press here, famous/important press people were dropping that phrase all the time these years. I hope you get now why you won't even convince me by using it.<br/><br/>On top of that, I draw comics, I mentioned this before. The first gig I had for that industry here was in a small publisher. I started drawing a comic of my own that was meant to be included in their trimestral anthology. The owner however had the same vision: give the people what they want. On those days that meant that even artists who didn't knew well how to draw anime, had to make anime. I could handle, but most of the other stuff on the magazine ended up looking weird. Forced. People who were into anime didn't felt it was anime like. People who liked more of a classical comic style felt it was too anime-like. It didn't sell good. So then the owner said "since we ought to keep giving people what they want, let's give them porn!". So I ended up drawing porn. It's definitely not my thing. And it wasn't either anybody's thing there. It showed in the product. And it showed on the sales. The company never published again, I went to work as a freelancer and vowed I'd never again draw a single page with that phrase in mind.<br/><br/>That being said, I don't think of myself as an artist. What I do is just work, not art. I'm not playing the "I'll never sell me" card here, I'm saying that "giving people what they want" doesn't work. You don't actually know what they want, because they don't know what they want until they see it. And whatever you do, you won't do your best if you hate what you do and your only motivation is money, and so people will notice and your stuff will sell poorly.</blockquote>\nThat sounds awful, but again, it isn't what I am talking about when I say it is okay to give people what they want. I'm definitely not advocating that.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455478">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455478/#Comment_455478" name="Item_143" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-03T14:48:59+00:00" title="August  3, 2016  2:48PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just stop using that specific phrase and explain yourself better.

Characterization and playing your character take creativity. I've seen this first hand. It requires a good deal of thought to play a believable character in a given situation. This is about what power you have in the setting. In a traditional RPG, the GM handles the setting details and the players handle their character details. That arrangement isn't because players are not interested in being creative. They are still being plenty creative. They just don't want to control the setting details outside their characters. Framing it as a creativity thing, misses the thing that is really drawing them to the game. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455484">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455484/#Comment_455484" name="Item_147" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-03T18:09:01+00:00" title="August  3, 2016  6:09PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>I am attempting to explain myself as well as I can but I still think it is an entirely useful phrase.

Instead of explaining all the rules and options, guide the players through a few of the procedures, step-by-step, and then let them loose later, once they get a hang of the procedure.<br/><br/>RPG play, as internalized by long-time gamers, is nothing intuitive. I believe that first-time gamers struggle with the very idea for the *very same reason* that <i>experienced</i> roleplayers struggle with games which don't work in *precisely* the way they expect them to.<br/><br/>(You can easily prove this to yourself buy picking an roughly unfamiliar-feeling rule, like "spend a Drama point to make a statement about plans you made in the past". An experienced roleplay struggles with this kind of thing, whereas a newbie immediately goes, "Cool! I have about ten ideas for stuff I can do with that.")<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20706/another-reason-indie-rpgs-are-having-a-hard-time-finding-a-mainstream-audience/p2" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20706/another-reason-indie-rpgs-are-having-a-hard-time-finding-a-mainstream-audience">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20706/another-reason-indie-rpgs-are-having-a-hard-time-finding-a-mainstream-audience/p2" rel="prev">2</a><a class="Highlight p-3" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20706/another-reason-indie-rpgs-are-having-a-hard-time-finding-a-mainstream-audience/p3">3</a><a class=" p-4 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20706/another-reason-indie-rpgs-are-having-a-hard-time-finding-a-mainstream-audience/p4" rel="next">4</a><a class="Next" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20706/another-reason-indie-rpgs-are-having-a-hard-time-finding-a-mainstream-audience/p4" rel="next">\xbb</a></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F20706%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F20706%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Another reason indie RPGs are having a hard time finding a mainstream audience - Page 4 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20706/another-reason-indie-rpgs-are-having-a-hard-time-finding-a-mainstream-audience/p4" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Another reason indie RPGs are having a hard time finding a mainstream audience - Page 4" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20706/another-reason-indie-rpgs-are-having-a-hard-time-finding-a-mainstream-audience/p4" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Total agreeement there.

The question you are trying to find an answer to is why indie RPGs are not finding a mainstream audience. The answer always seems to be a variation on "something is broken or needs improvement" with either RPGs themselves or the people who play and introduce others to them. Yet there have been plenty of attempts at this point by indie rag publishers to bridge that gap, and it doesn't seem it has made things any more mainstream than when D&amp;D first had a big explosion in the 70s and 80s (in face the biggest explosions in popularity have all been around versions of the system I imagine a lot of people here would find clunky and unintuitive). <br/><br/>People have been complaining and trying to address this problem for ages, yet it never really has helped grow the hobby in the mainstream. I think if there had been success here fifteen, ten or five years ago, people might be on to something. At this point, to me it is pretty obvious there may just be limited interest in RPGs at the present moment and what it will take to change that isn't the perfect rulebook or system, but the perfect set of circumstances. <br/><br/>This quote is I think the heart of your problem: \n<blockquote>experienced gamers stuck in what they think is RPG play</blockquote>\nAs long as you take that condescending and superior attitude, you will never understand what motivates people who play traditional RPGs, or what motivates long time gamers that game differently from you.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455501/#Comment_455501" name="Item_153" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-05T14:19:17+00:00" title="August  5, 2016  2:19PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I actually learned to play Basic D&amp;D with my brother.

None of my friends who joined us had been DMs and I don't think any (many?) of them had played in other groups before joining mine, though I recall at least one or two of the kids a year older than me seemed to understand the rules. Maybe they had played a bit.<br/><br/>None of it was intuitive. It was all a struggle to figure out how to learn and we ended up creating our own thing out of it. Over time, comparing it to other people's gaming, there was a syncretism of ideas and "truing up" of my understanding of The Rules (as if there were some objective truth I was aspiring to).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455503">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455503/#Comment_455503" name="Item_154" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-05T16:04:04+00:00" title="August  5, 2016  4:04PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Paul. You know, I had the same problem with the Fiasco Tabletop episode. Fiasco really picked my curiosity, I readed as much as I can found, I think I still have one of the beta PDFs that got around when it all started, and got the game up to the point where it states "in your turn you either get to frame a scene or say how it ends"... and today I still feel like it's some sort of indiana jones ride with the rails suddenly cut above a chasm, where the game doesn't say how that scene should be framed nor what limits are to how I could resolve it besides some game principles, more or less advice, interesting examples, etc. I mean, it's still a jump of faith, where I've got to pray to safely land where the rails continue.<br/><br/>I get all the rest of the game, and seeing how they played it on tabletop, I confirmed most of how I understood the game was okey... and that that part was still the same. Will and the rest seem to get over it and pull it right by sheer experience. While I know I can put an effort and improvise like them, I also know I'd feel awkward as hell doing it, and that the rest of my group would feel the pressure worse than me.<br/><br/>Words like awkward, uncomfortable, nervous, jump of faith... doesn't anybody feel reminded of the first time you roleplayed? I do. I had a heck of a good time the first time I roleplayed, but even after being explained the basics of the game several times, it took me probably 15 min to get used to a situation out of my zone of confort. Oh, it was exciting at the same time and curiosity guided me there too, but had I been a different person, or the party less experienced/with more playing issues (and you know how common is that even among veteran players) I'd probably wouldn't have lasted long.<br/><br/>Not all of my friends who tried roleplaying at least once fell in love with it. Some looked like they enjoyed the creativity part but felt complex rules as a block. Some didn't felt at ease with the group or the way the game went, or the view on the subjects used to fuel the fiction. Some got heavily blocked at the start because of how the game went; definitely there are some game situations not meant to be experienced so early by new players.<br/><br/>There is of course people who simply don't like it. I mean, if you're the kind of person that enjoys more drinking and heavy music over quiet places and conversations, there's a good chance you won't enjoy tabletop RPGs too much. Or perhaps not, perhaps you didn't liked long conversations because you couldn't thought of anything to say, but having a game to guide the conversation may feel liberating to you. There are many other reasons. The ones that matter for the purposes of the thread are the ones we can change through design, publicity, better explanations, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455504">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455504/#Comment_455504" name="Item_155" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-05T16:35:53+00:00" title="August  5, 2016  4:35PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It could also do a lot of good to the discussion if we could think more of RPGs as a whole new media that it's still in development. We've been borrowing stuff from other fields and developing stuff ourselves. And while the game has certainly developed and evolved in many different ways, and you can find advice for every game and every possible playstyle with that game, there's always more, some new ideas, ways to take the game conversation, mindframes to see it through. In all my years of gaming I havent heard of enough conclussive material on serious studies of the game. We got the Forge theory and now it's outdated. We've got Play Unsafe, but what about books on different gaming experiences, with some field testing behind to back it up?<br/><br/>Even if RPGs are completely functional as an experience right now for a large group of people, we still don't have facts about how that experience can be properly reproduced. We got clues, theories, advice, but relly few statistics, conclussions and no actual proved principle about any specific kind of game experience. I find all this mistery really exciting. I want to find out more, test more, try new things. I refuse to believe this is it and that this media can't grow further, as at each step I take in any direction, possibilites multiply tenfold.<br/><br/>Does anyone here actually thinks they know it all about RPGs and there's nothing else we can do with them? We're not saying there's something <i>wrong</i> with RPGs as they are. There's a lot we<i> don't know about them</i> even while we use them a lot. We don't know every detail about how microvawe ovens nor smartphones work and we still use them. We aren't sure what's gravity about and have been using it forever. What if we found out there are things we could do with it we haven't tried yet? What if we discover some things we already do could be threating our health? Why should we not try and experiment to find out?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_455507">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan" title="AnonAdderlan (Banned)"><img alt="AnonAdderlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan">AnonAdderlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455507/#Comment_455507" name="Item_156" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-06T03:17:27+00:00" title="August  6, 2016  3:17AM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To get back on track, being judged is a <i>huge</i> deterrent to any kind of creative participation, which is why RPGs have safety valves.

Sales 101 is identifying the need and meeting it. You get there by investigating, asking questions, etc. You don't get there by projecting your sense of self on the customer. But what I see here is the kind of speculation you get in a lot of fan communities, where the speculation all just happens to be of the variety that paints the fan community in a special light (people who play the games we like are there because they possess or are interested in these qualities we value; people who don't either don't possess them or are not sufficiently interested in them). This seems like a very bad way to figure things out to me. <br/><br/>I agree the whole point is figure out why more people don't share our interests, but you don't get there unless you make honest attempts to understand why people do and don't play these games. If your investigation is driven by ideology or negative assumptions about people, you won't make any headway. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455509">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455509/#Comment_455509" name="Item_158" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-06T06:03:14+00:00" title="August  6, 2016  6:03AM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 6, 2016 6:16AM by Bedrockbrendan.">edited August 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/><br/>As long as you consider statements like that 'condescending' we're never going to be able to accurately address the issues.

I think it it is always good to introduce non-gamers to RPGs. I encourage that. And I am not going to knock you for it. But that doesn't mean everything you say about what motivates people is true. When I've disagreed with you on just about anything, your approach, isn't even to inquire more about why I disagree or figure out where I am coming from, it is to tell me I am somehow unwilling to listen or learn (or that I need to change my mindset to grow in someway).

Some communities are more prone than others. The forge had an actual glossary for example. But even mainstream forums where people talk about gaming a lot develop their own language, and even gamers themselves away from the internet develop lingo. Some of it can be helpful, but it can also make things murky for newer players (especially when they are expressed as acronyms). So anything from Actor's Stance to GMPC. Even mechanical terms that are somewhat necessary for some games (AoO) add to that learning curve.

When you have a new approach or new game and want people to adopt it, it is on you to convince them. Turning it into their problem when they don't like what you have to offer (or when they don't understand your pitch) is just bad salesmanship. Saying 'they are stuck in their ways' or 'refuse to change' doesn't even attempt to understand why they do what they do (it is just a negative characterization, not an explanation). And it rarely convinces anyone. People might not want to change. Probably because they are satisfied with what they have and find it works just fine. If you dismiss that at refusal or stilubborness, you'll never understand them. And I say that as an small publisher who makes a non-D&amp;D game and would love it if played other RPGs more often. But if I sneered at people every time they said they'd rather play a version of D&amp;D than my game, I'd not only be a jerk, I wouldn't understand why D&amp;D (or some version of it) already fits their needs and eorks just fine for them). Again, it is on me to convince them, and there is nothing wrong with them if I fail to do so. And it goes the same for people who don't play RPGs. Just because they would rather play s more mainstream board game, doesn't mean they have a refusal to change. People sometimes just are not interested in your stuff.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455518">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455518/#Comment_455518" name="Item_164" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-06T13:49:49+00:00" title="August  6, 2016  1:49PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 6, 2016 1:52PM by Rickard.">edited August 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Here is where you reference traditional gamers: \n<blockquote>experienced gamers stuck in what they think is RPG play</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\nAnd you keep on quoting outside of context, as usual.

I often find myself in awe how things from different fields explain better how things in RPGs work, and show how efficient it is at how it does and how it could get better for different specific ways of playing. I've seen new interesting ways of roleplaying develop from this. If this practice is going to be called things like "you misappropriate findings in unrelated fields." as it's something wrong, I can't stop feeling like we're propossing heliocentrism in front of the inquisition. Eppure si muove.<br/><br/>-Saying that a thing could be better doesn't imply that people who like it are primitive or wrong. I can't count the time I've been repeating the same thing: I'm okey with the people who like it as it is. The thread ws supposed to adress the market opportunity given by the amount of people who don't like it as it is and how to reach that audience.

A mistake that almost every game that tries to court a new audience makes is producing an rpg that looks like an rpg. The sad fact is that if your target audience wanted to play an rpg they would have done so by now. For whatever reason your target audience has stayed away from rpgs, and designing a product that looks lie one will do nothing to attract Them. You\u2019re absolutely right about dread. Convincing horror fans that Dread is a game is a bit of a stretch. it doesn\u2019t come in a box with a board or as a deck of cards, and it won\u2019t fit in an XBOX.

I'd say that's a big reason we can't expect indie games to be as big as they could be in terms of game quality.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Fixitus" title="Fixitus"><img alt="Fixitus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Fixitus">Fixitus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455598/#Comment_455598" name="Item_176" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-14T01:00:53+00:00" title="August 14, 2016  1:00AM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Potential, definitely. I think we can only expect the small trickle of us to make it here the way we have. As it is, our passion is a niche of a niche of a niche. This is something of a feature to me in many ways but that is not the point of the thread. I guess my point was that we might take a lesson from Nintendo and not assume our larger potential audience is already established as gamers.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455600">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rgrassi" title="rgrassi"><img alt="rgrassi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rgrassi">rgrassi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455600/#Comment_455600" name="Item_177" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-14T13:02:35+00:00" title="August 14, 2016  1:02PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a><br/>Exactly. <br/>"Why <i>should</i> we expect story games/indie RPGs to be successful with a mainstream audience?"<br/>Maybe because we have the evidence that most people likes fiction (non interactive fiction, like comics, theatre, movies, and so on...) so we expect that these people should have a trigger like this:<br/>"Wow. I like this serial. Well, now I want to make my own TV serie!" and starts looking in the (intricated) indie segment.<br/>Well, it does not work in this way.<br/>For the same reason why even if I like arts I do not want to paint my own self-portrait.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455607">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455607/#Comment_455607" name="Item_178" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-15T21:35:55+00:00" title="August 15, 2016  9:35PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is quite interesting, because today I was thinking a lot about this thread. <br/><br/>I got together with two non-gamer friends, with whom I had previously discussed the idea of a "story game". So far, everyone I've talked to about the idea loves it and almost immediately wants to try it. <br/><br/>In their case, I mentioned a game called "Fiasco" about a week ago, and sent them a link to the Tabletop episode. They watched the episode and *immediately* bought Fiasco (before they even finished watching it). <br/><br/>So I was quite surprised when they contacted me and demanded that we get together and play! We did so today, and had a blast. We played one of my storytelling games instead of Fiasco (I find it easier to play and more reliably fun - Fiasco can sometimes run off the rails, in comparison) and now they want to play another game as soon as we can manage another afternoon together.<br/><br/>It's not data, but I've had this kind of response often from non-gamers (although this particular case is unusually strong!). <br/><br/>I don't really have a conclusion to draw, but thought I'd mention it here. Interesting!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20706/another-reason-indie-rpgs-are-having-a-hard-time-finding-a-mainstream-audience/p3" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20706/another-reason-indie-rpgs-are-having-a-hard-time-finding-a-mainstream-audience">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20706/another-reason-indie-rpgs-are-having-a-hard-time-finding-a-mainstream-audience/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20706/another-reason-indie-rpgs-are-having-a-hard-time-finding-a-mainstream-audience/p3" rel="prev">3</a><a class="Highlight p-4 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20706/another-reason-indie-rpgs-are-having-a-hard-time-finding-a-mainstream-audience/p4">4</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F20706%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F20706%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
