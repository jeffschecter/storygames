They bother me on both the male and female side as recent studies have shown that young men are beginning to shift culturally towards over-identification of fantasy images; the perfect body, the perfect weight... these are issues which are impacting our entire society. As the father of a little girl who will always have a facial scar, body-image, self-image, and our cultures obsession with "perfection" are things that are *really* important to me.<br/><br/>I don't think the discussion of what could or couldn't be done in, say, gymnastics with large breasts has any bearing on the body-image issues, though. And, really, I never (and would never) said that "it doesn't matter." I said it's always surreal to me. Like the episode of Fraggle Rock where Gobo tries to tell Wembly that ghosts aren't real. It's part of the point of the episode that you shouldn't be afraid of ghosts because they're not real... but it was *Fraggles* making the point. It's surreal to me. I think the discussion is interesting, and there's no doubt that it's true (you really never see larger than a C cup on any female athlete). I also don't doubt that the comic and fantasy artists are *very* aware of it. They just don't care. If they cared about reality, women would have smaller breasts, Batman's cape would be gone, and Super Man wouldn't be able to fly.<br/><br/>Not to put too fine of a point on it, but I want to be perfectly clear: I don't think the discussion of how realistic it is is relevant, but that does not mean I think the popular portrayal of boobs in comics and fantasy art is okay. It's not, IMO. It's a low-brow tactic to sell to our base instincts and helps promote negative self-image and objectification.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eric</cite>CBGs?<br/>Canadian Brigade Groups?

I thnk the first two seasons or so, I can actually see both sides here. On one hand, I really like a lot about the Starbuck character. She's cool, she's kickass and I've found that really refreshing and just plain nice. It's been something I've been really missing and so seeing it here was really nice.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I really dislike some other aspects of the character. Some are mentioned in the podcast, like the whole abuse backstory, which isn't a problem by itself, but it's simply a trope that's overdone. Also, sometimes it felt really ... heavy-handed how Starbuck was handled. Like, sometimes I'd appreciate as kickass woman that, you know, didn't act like a huge asshole with depressing regularity. <br/><br/>Still, BSG would be much, much worse without her. She's cool, I like her. But I can really see both side here.<br/><br/>And now I'll stop talking about something completely OT now. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141636">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anemone" title="Anemone"><img alt="Anemone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.tlucretius.net/temp/anemone_icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anemone">Anemone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141636/#Comment_141636" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-29T15:54:51+00:00" title="April 29, 2008  3:54PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I didn't fall in love with BSG the way a large number of gamers have, but I didn't find Starbucks particularly jarring.

I might have skimmed past a third link, or perhaps amongst the many other links given on the pages, there was one. I need a more direct link, I think.<br/><br/>Basically your phrasing suggests your taking me in the wrong way - I can find answers that will convince me?? My question was like asking what colour they like - there is no convincing answer to that question. I either believe it's their fave colour or I don't. Same with how to portray an alpha female to celebrate it - the actual form given doesn't need to convince me. I just want to know and I'm interested in what the women in this interview would decide on...really interested. And that's assuming they want to celebrate some alpha female fertility thing - perhaps being objectified in society and the mundane practicalities of breasts means there is no romantic image to be found there for them. In which case I'll also just accept they don't want some big old alpha female image. That's fair enough too and I'm interested in that responce if it comes.<br/><br/>Convincing isn't part of this at all. But what I do know is that if you want to celebrate something, if your tearing down the old image, your going to need a new image. So I do say, hey, if your gunna tear down the old one, what are you gunna use now?

How the cape denoted problems during the anal phase, what does it mean to use your underwear inside out...<br/><br/>And it really gives me a pause to think why male superheroes don't have a snake crawling around their tights.

For those that don't now it, it's basically about sex and violence, in a to me really refreshing and kinda self-referential way. Anyway, in some fight, Bomb Queen, the main character and just about the most sexualized super villain I've ever seen, is fighting a hired superhero of the "male, with spandex and cape" variety, using various dirty tricks and at some point grabs his crotch. She later manages to trick him so she can get away, yadayadayada, main thing is: After the fight, the superhero is interviewed and gets right into the usual "justice and so on" spiel ... while sprouting an erection under his tight spandex suit.<br/><br/>Quote: "Ehm, excuse me?

The GM said he thought "Oh, God. I hope she hates the game and leaves, otherwise my players are going to be too distracted to play". That got me really really annoyed. It's just not the attitude, it's that he said it as if it were the most natural thing in the world. So, I really think that while facilitating games for women ids the way to go, I also think that you should take a stance about those misogynist gamers (and non gamers) everywhere.<br/><br/>Hmrrrr...

It's a damn shame, too. I blame a very long list of people for that including the boy, his friends, his parents (particularly his father), his grandparents (particularly his grandfather), religion, public school, and Society As A Whole including Culture.<br/><br/>Because I know that all boys are not this way. Boys can be socialized, self-disciplined, unrepressed and can be made capable of or given help in managing their own brain chemistry. But not if they are being parented by inattentive parents, given conflicting messages by religion, and never held accountable to themselves or others.<br/><br/>*sigh* Dammit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Third Geek Girls Rule!

There's no perfect equivalent to the term "loser" in Italian, either, actually.<br/><br/>But I'm rambling, and wandering: I was just trying to underline that it's not just a matter of having known or experienced something.

When you discover a friend of yours is a bigot, it's a hard thing to digest. Specially, because, as "Denys" points out, he seems to be a really nice guy... except you suddenly discover he's not as nice as you think. But I find great joy in seeing the reactions of the general population of RPG.net when these threads appear. It's about the only time the people there forget all their differences and just act as good people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_142186">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tadk" title="tadk"><img alt="tadk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nAYGI7O6LI2LV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tadk">tadk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142186/#Comment_142186" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-03T13:53:21+00:00" title="May  3, 2008  1:53PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Posted By: Simon CIf you are unable to relax and be yourself when there's a woman in the room, then you have a problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my case it is I have a problem because I am unable to relax and be myself when there's anyone else in the room.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142196/#Comment_142196" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-03T14:46:52+00:00" title="May  3, 2008  2:46PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, Tad, yes... it sounds like you do.

Besides, my point about playing with friends was that between friends there should be a much lesser need of a "persona". Especially since most of the public ones are "shield" personas. If you still need that shield then yes, I think you are missing the opportunity to really relax and enjoy the company of your friends. <br/><br/>You could well have very good reasons... for example groups of teenage friends are often composed because of "geography" more than "true bonding" and you can end with one or more people within the group that you call friends, but that you don't trust enough on a deep level to not assume your persona.<br/><br/>Coming back to games, I remember the Sons of Kryos mentioning in an old episode a couple of "good sentences" that I think came from Emily Care Boss, regarding playing with or around subjects that can hurt, disturb and so on. Unfortunately I cannot remember them correctly, but the sense was "If you choose to go there, we as a group will be there for you, you will not be alone" it's a big leap of trust and faith, though. I can see in many gaming groups one could not feel ready to do that...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6396/third-geek-girls-rule-podcast" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6396/third-geek-girls-rule-podcast" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6396/third-geek-girls-rule-podcast/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F6396%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F6396%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
