                    Over in Tony's <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1569" rel="nofollow">Focus on conflict</a> thread, there was this confusion that Tony cared about conflict.  That's not what he was after, which is cool, even if it does feel like kind of a common problem around these parts recently.  So, I was getting something interesting out of the tangents that were spinning off of that discussion in the misapprehension that we were on topic, and I wanted to start them over over here.<br/><br/>So, my contention is that any characteristic of a character that doesn't contribute to a literary style conflict (i.e. not a CR setup and resolution, but an actually nascent plot arc) is a mere quirk, something that distinguishes the character a little bit, but not part of what we care about in the character.  This relates in a very strong way to the idea of using up the conflict in a character, and to Tony's question about what makes these traits something you care about.<br/><br/>I'd further contend that the reverse is true: that a mere quirk can become a fully fledged character trait if it's involved in a conflict.<br/><br/>Of course, my squirminess in this at present is this: the only solid distinction between a quirk and a trait would be whether they are or could be (either by inherent quality, or systemically) involved in a conflict.  I don't think that's the real definition, to be honest, but that's as close to a formal definition as I can come right now.  A second squirm is this: what do I mean by "involved in a conflict?"  I want to say that the conflict arises because of the interaction between the trait in question and a second trait, local to the character in question or elsewhere, but I suspect flexibility here will be a virtue.<br/><br/>Finally, the operation I'm alluding to in the title there is convolution, a signal processing concept I'm gleefully abusing for the annoyance of the other engineers in the audience.<br/><br/>So that's my position on traits and conflict.  Dispute?  Agreement?  Difference of opinion?                </div>

                            It sounds to me like you're trying to tie the definition you've given ("attribute which does not contribute to framing or resolving a conflict is a quirk, one that does so contribute is a trait") to the <i>connotations</i> of the words.<br/><br/>You're trying, in short, to say something about the <i>elements</i> that you're singling out with the definition by your choice of word to name them.  Which is cool. It's what we all do.<br/><br/>But I think we could probably reduce the risk of semantic nonsense if you went a bit further, and asserted something about quirks vs. traits.<br/><br/>Like if you said "A character without any traits cannot be part of a story that addresses premise, but a character without any quirks can be part of such a story," then you'd already have said something that people could chew on and apply your definitions to.  How's that sound?                        </div>

                            Absolutely.  And I'd adopt that assertion pretty much whole cloth.  So:<br/><br/>Traits are a prerequisite of a character being able to address a premise.<br/>Traits are what really engage our interest in a character.<br/><br/>Quirks, on the other hand are throwaway descriptors.  They're the theme on your character's Monopoly.  <br/><br/>But it takes in-fiction conflict to make any characteristic a trait.  Pretty much any characteristic can potentially be either a trait or a quirk, absent the context of whether or not they're engaged in conflict.                        </div>

                            'kay.  I disagree pretty entirely with the idea that traits are what engage our interest.<br/><br/>I'm a pretty conflict-oriented guy, but for many of my favorite characters I can't even remember what sort of hardships they went through, but I can remember their (in your terms) quirks.<br/><br/>Harper was nasty, and straightforward about how nasty he was, and had an unfailing sense of humor even when circumstances went against him (which they almost always did).<br/><br/>Robin was sweet, and strong, and a little soft-hearted.  He was lonely, even in a group.  He tried to be a good friend, but somewhere along the line his ability to open up to people had just burned out.<br/><br/>Kurt was honorable and patriotic, but honorable first.  He valued flair and panache over effectiveness, but worked long and hard to achieve both at the same time.  He feared to get close to people, and used his duties as armor to avoid it.  He believed in the value of being friendly, even (especially!) to your enemies.<br/><br/>I seriously cannot remember what kinds of conflicts these people got into.  I remember, vaguely, that they changed and grew, but I don't remember how.<br/><br/>How seriously engaged could I have been with that other stuff, if the Quirks are all I remember now?                        </div>

                            I think I disagree with you. I'll try to lay out how I think things work, and we can compare. I'll deliberately avoid using any of the terminology you set up, to avoid name collisions. <br/><br/>So, each character has a set of distinctive features. Any particular feature can become apparent to the audience only through contrast with other characters. You can't have a character seem brave if every character is brave, or wise if every character is wise. Bravery is revealed when there are cowards to contrast it against, and wisdom only when it can reprove folly. This is because we can only judge a character within his or her context, and if everyone is exactly the same there's no scale we can use to understand the intensity of a particular trait. <br/><br/>Now, contrast does not have any necessary connection with the conflict in a story. You can use contrast to reveal similarities between the protagonist and the antagonist just as easily as differences. For example, suppose the *tagonists are a Jedi knight and a Sith lord, and we see them continue to duel on an exploding starship, even as the ordinary soldiers around them run for their lives from the pyrotechnic CGI effects. The conflict is between the two Force-wielders, but the contrast in this scene is between them and the mooks -- we see that the depth of rivalry between these two is deeper than even the human desire for self-preservation. The stormtroopers and rebels don't even need <em>names</em>, as long as we can imagine them as average human beings with a typical desire to live.                        </div>

                            You know there's already a word for "quirks"---<b>color</b>. From the Forge Glossary:
<blockquote>Imagined details about any or all of System, Character, Setting, or Situation, added in such a way that does not change aspects of action or resolution in the imagined scene.</blockquote>
So... yeah. The second some aspect of color gets engaged in "action or resolution" (ie conflict) it stops being color.                        </div>

                            Judson,<br/><br/>Could you possibly posit a couple of example character descriptions to illustrate?<br/><br/>On an aside, that color term doesn't address a fundamental point.  Tons of folk play in a given setting precisely for the color, that color is why they are in that game.  Now, that doesn't mean the definition is problematic, it depends on how it is used, but that point may be relevant to this discussion.<br/><br/>Oh, and I shall post an example character, one I actually played, to see where we come out.  <br/><br/>Alfric Pernix, son of a Roman legionary whose wife was a British tribeswoman.  Alfric is a committed Christian, an experienced soldier, loyal to his friends and the things he believes in but increasingly prone to interpreting his faith to suit the situation.  Alfric is tired of killing, and travels so as to learn the stories and craft that will let him become a storyteller, so spreading joy and comfort instead of death and tyranny.<br/><br/>That's almost enough I could play Alfric in Heroquest, is there any way of telling what is a quirk and what is a trait?                        </div>

                            I think Kurly's got the right of it.  The Quirk/Trait distinction is based on what's thrust to prominence in a given situation.  If I've got Chemistry on my character sheet and spent a whole ton of points in it but I never use it, it's just a quirk.  If I bought marginally competent skill in Chemistry and it's essential to the game, then it's definitely a trait.  Here's the thing, though: consider a pregen character that is run through two different situations with two different players at the helm.  In one situation, his Daddy Issues are an important part of the game; in another situation, his Daddy Issues aren't.  Is his Daddy Issues a quirk or a trait?  If those two situations were part of the same game with the same player, would the answer change?                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Balbinus</cite>Judson,<br/><br/>Could you possibly posit a couple of example character descriptions to illustrate?<br/></blockquote>
Honestly, I think Kurly and Josh are closest to being in my camp on this one.  Alfric as a static character doesn't help me.  Without conflict, his characteristics aren't traits or quirks.  Depending on what you tell me (as your GM), or what interests me, some of that is going to be quirk and some of it is going to be trait.  Alfric does suit for three examples though:<br/><br/>I could run a game where I push the necessity to kill, and play that to Alfric's twisting of Christianity, and his weariness with violence.  Then they'd be traits, and his loyalty, heritage and storytelling would be quirks.  <br/><br/>Or I could set up a more social game, where his loyalty to his comrades, and the fact that his mother was a Briton would come into things, and he might drive or resolve conflict by telling stories.  Then the war-weariness and Christianity might just be quirks.<br/><br/>Or, the situation could be in the midst of a campaign, so the weariness, loyalty and heritage (are you loyal to Rome, or Britain?) would be traits, and the other things might be quirks.<br/><br/>And, certainly, you could say "I'm interested in these things more than those" and influence the situation that way.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>'kay.  I disagree pretty entirely with the idea that traits are what engage our interest.<br/></blockquote>
To be honest, I'm not sure if I buy that one either.  I think they can be very engaging, and I'm prone to wonder where the qualities you remember about your conflicts came from.  I mean, did you just write up their sheets, and then glow over them?  My experience is that those memorable traits were the result of conflict.<br/><br/>And granted, I came out a little punchy because I saw a bunch of neat ideas stirring up in your thread that I wanted to see.  I think that was kind of an error, since it seems only to have polarized conversation.                        </div>

Who cares if Holmes is a chemist, or wears a deerstalker hat, or unwinds with a little cocaine?<br/><br/>He's a detective.  Every story is about him pitting his abilities as a detective against criminals.  He's British, and britishness does get tied up in a lot of the stories.  Everything else is unimportant.                        </div>

                            So the hat is <em>exactly</em> as important as the character's name.  It serves to identify him.  Fine.  But it's not what I'm trying to get at.  <br/><br/>This hypothesis was a reaction to Tony's "Focus on Conflict leads to incomplete characters," and I suppose in direct reaction, my contention is that without conflict, the characters are incomplete, and that precisely the qualities of a character that Tony was talking about, the things that we afterwards want to see them simply expressing - them having a good day - only become those qualities (which for the purposes of this discussion I'm calling traits) through their expression in conflict.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>Thomas, what audience?</blockquote>
Shreyas,<br/><br/>I consider all players to simultaneously (or something that approximates simultaneity) adopt both the author and the audience roles in most (all?) roleplaying groups.  The author role is the one you use to tell people things, it's how you communicate ideas to the other people.  The audience role is how you listen to people telling you things, it's how you interpret the incoming communication.<br/><br/>So, to restate me question in these terms: can the contrast come from the difference between the fictional characters and the real-world players who are watching what they do?<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

You're dicussing the significance of color.<br/><br/>And if you look back at old discussions, it's clear that color IS important, even if it doesn't have a mechanical effect. Darth Vader's helmet and cape may simply be color, but it still sets the mood.

                            Thomas, I agree with you about the role of the players as audience and author, but I don't know the answer to your question.

                            Judson<br/><br/>sometimes quirks/color are more important than traits activated in conflict, sometimes the reverse; often they mutually enrich.<br/><br/>if i'm enjoying the color and a conflict is introduced because we think that what stories are supposed to be about, then I will want to truncate the conflict or not get as engaged as I otherwise might.

Thanks, Curly, I must have been thinking of some other famous aspect of the character that was established by the movies.<br/><br/>Anyway, yes, his hat matters because it's a signifier for him - when you see the guy in the deerstalker it's Sherlock Holmes. So I'm arguing that introducing bits of colour which act as signifiers for the characters, which distinguish them, is a good thing, even if they never have any mechanical effect or use in conflict.                        </div>

                            Going back to the OP:
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judson Lester</cite><br/>So, my contention is that any characteristic of a character that doesn't contribute to a literary style conflict (i.e. not a CR setup and resolution, but an actually nascent plot arc) is a mere quirk, something that distinguishes the character a little bit, but not part of what we care about in the character. This relates in a very strong way to the idea of using up the conflict in a character, and to Tony's question about what makes these traits something you care about.<br/><br/>I'd further contend that the reverse is true: that a mere quirk can become a fully fledged character trait if it's involved in a conflict.<br/><br/></blockquote>
To refocus on the original question, then: Do we care about SH's hat (or pipe, or whatever), or does it just serve to distinguish the character? Is it a "mere" quirk?<br/><br/>And I tend to agree with timfire: Yes, we care about it, because we care about colour - some of us, anyway. We care that it's <i>this</i> English detective, and we know that by his hat. Therefore, by association, we care about the hat.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MikeRM</cite>So I'm arguing that introducing bits of colour which act as signifiers for the characters, which distinguish them, is a good thing, even if they never have any mechanical effect or use in conflict.</blockquote>
I don't see how either of those sentiments are incompatible with what I'm talking about.  On the other hand, the fact that they seem cogent underscores that I'm not clear myself on what exactly I'm getting at.<br/><br/>I'm not trying to say that quirks are completely superfluous.  Or even that they're not cool.  In fact, as handles on the character, they're almost essential, since they give us a handle on the character from which we can manipulate him and see his traits, if that metaphor isn't too cluttered.<br/><br/>Or that every moment of play has to be devoted to conflict.  Secondary sources, on the other hand, reflect that the movie you're relating, Mark, is about an assassin who never slips up, so I wonder how off my analogy to Gene Hackman in <cite>The Conversation</cite> was.  It sounds like the long scene searching his apartment underscores his flawless practice, and involves that trait in his conflict with the police; I'm stabbing wildly in the dark, though.  Nevertheless, there's no rule that says you can't have scenes that don't drive conflict, and I'm not immune to their allure, either.<br/><br/>I'm trying to say that I think traits are essential to an engaging character, and the conflict and traits are inter-linked.  I'm tempted to say that traits are the premise of a character, or a character's interface with their situation, or something high flown like that, but I'm resistant.  "Premise of character" implies a stasis that I think is antithetical to my concept, and the interface thing implies that one or the other need to come first, which isn't right either.                        </div>

Somehow we're not sharing an understanding.  I agree: Darth Vader's cape is color.  It helps denote him, sets mood, looks cool.  Not saying it's not important.  If that's all he was though, we wouldn't think of him as the ultimate space villain.  His cruelty, determination, pathos, and command of the force are necessary to make him an interesting character.

 Curly, I've seen the film once so I haven't absorbed every nuance but the scene gave me a different impression: sometimes people, even assassins, lie on their beds smoking (and it's ok to show that for an extended period.) In hindsight it does suggest that the character won't reveal much about his motives, which is a little closer to what you got from it.<br/><br/>Judson, I think he might have had the rep as a peerless killer but he screwed up one of his hits and the film shows the ramifications.                        </div>

So good color quirks are those which are visible manifestations of traits that will focus or modify conflict for a character? That is to say, they aren't the thing that conflict will center on, nor the thing that will decide the conflict. They are, however, often tags that link to the elements that will be in conflict. <br/><br/>Darth Vader's costume = color = visible symbol of the dark knight and oppressive father<br/><br/>Wolverine's Claws = color = a symbol of the torturous government programs that drove him to be a killing machine<br/><br/>Batman's Cape = color = a sign of the inner darkness that drives the hero towards anti-hero behaviors<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes magnifying glass = color = visible symbol of being a detective <br/><br/>Peter Parker's Sense of Humor = color(?) = reflection of the everyman being put into ironically impossible situations<br/><br/>Bromir's Horn of Gondor = color = manifestation of the pride of Gondor that will drive him apart from the rest of the group<br/><br/>Indian Jone's Hat = color = ? I suppose its a pulp icon of the rugged indivdualist based on the image of the archeologist adventurer, but it doesn't quite seem to fit into the mold. What does make the hat cool, aside from the fact that it is cool? <br/><br/>Jesus's Blue Sash = um, what the hell are you talking about Josh? <br/><br/>At this point it seems like we're starting to get into bundle theory vs. substratum style debates - is the hero the total compilation of their traits, or only the "important basic conflict" of the character? I'd posit that when the character starts its the basic conflicts that matter, but that unless the bundle of associated traits developes quickly thereafter the character will never come to full life. Like we didn't know, the first second that Indian Jones is on screen, how important the hat would be. But by the end of the third movie if he spent the last 30 minutes without his hat, we'd sure as fuck notice -- even if it isn't relevant to any of the ongoing conflicts.                        </div>

                            'sense of humor' has been mentioned a couple times.<br/><br/>I think it could be the perfect example of a purely decorative trait.<br/>Not in every case.<br/><br/>But in-particular in the case of laugh-track sitcom comedy.<br/><br/>Why do The Family Guy characters compulsively utter one-liners and cultural references like clockwork?<br/>What bearing does it have on their interaction with each epidsode's situation, and to the characters relationships?<br/><br/>Another purely decorative trait is The Crocodile Hunter Steve Irwin's "talking to the camera".  Check out this review of his movie,<br/>from The Onion:<br/>"Simultaneously a bland, predictable kids' movie and an almost avant-garde exercise in stylistic experimentation, Collision Course is two films in one. One is an extended, glorified episode of Crocodile Hunter, in which Irwinâ€”ostensibly playing himself alongside real-life wife Terriâ€”fondles poisonous snakes, crocodiles, and other dangerous varmints while delivering a non-stop, eco-friendly rant directly to the camera. The other movie, which seems to have little to do with Irwin's natterings, is an almost comically generic spy yarn involving a satellite, a pair of CIA agents, a foxy Australian lady spy, and a plump, crocodile-hating farmer. The two strands don't intersect until well into the film, and while the Discovery Channel's name is dropped several times, at no point is it actually established that Irwin is a television star talking to a cameraman and not, say, a raving lunatic talking to himself. Other than Irwin's wife, no other character talks to the camera: They all seem oblivious to it, which makes for some disorienting, not terribly compelling viewing."                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>&lt;0&gt;You think that's fundamental?  Or is it a historical artifact?</blockquote>
Historical artifact. <br/><br/>Or, that is to say, it's easier to do it that way and have it come off right. Putting the quirk first and hoping it works out is harder. So if you build from the big block, its easier to balance the smaller ones. <br/><br/>This, however, does not mean that it has to be that way. It just means that I see a lot of people having an easier/more natural time doing it like that. <br/><br/>The Indy's whip issue reminds me of a conversation I had with John Kim about supers RPGs and how his players would come up with characterization and conflict by working from quirks to traits. Like how the different speedsters would have quirks about their speed powers that would develop into personality issues, come into conflict, and eventually become a core of what the character was about. <br/><br/>Thing is it is fairly easy to come up with quirks. The question is how to make them work when you come up with them first. The Owl had claws and funky hair, and he didn't make it. Wolverine comes along with the same exact look a few years later and hits it big. Where's the difference and how do we make process to help it happen in game?<br/><br/>Edit: It occurs to me that the whip makes first apperance, and is almost instantly used to resolve a conflict. Maybe if we went in with a list of quirks that we thought would be cool, and then ticked off a limited number (3 to 5?) as they actually hit the table and let the others fall by the wayside it would help? Like going in as a GM with a bandolier of bangs, but this time going in with an ammo belt of cool quirks.<br/><br/>Or some kind of "generate a cool quirk" helper, like the Exalted "stunt assistant" that RPG.net came up with years back, where there were lists of generic stunt elements and you'd plug in your characters personal style and use them to generate cinematic badassery. It also occurs to me that Mo, and a few others I play with, always find a picture of their character before they make the character, and use the distinctive elements of the picture to help focus what the kewl factor of the character will be, so that could be usefull as well.                        </div>

                            Reminds me a little of how we play Dogs - over sessions, traits that are not reliably or meaningfully deployed get downgraded or removed as fallout, and these are just as much quirks like "tugs at goatee" as conflict-oriented stuff like "subordinate to the Book"... So we began with a big set of colour ingredients  but some never make it into the melting pot.                        </div>

Hmm, Ron Edwards has mentioned a number of times how he and his friends would create drama in his Champion games (in other words, create issues associated with Premise) by utilizing quirks/traits/etc. His favorite was by picking two opposing traits. This sounds like it's the same thing John was talking about.<br/><br/>This was a semi-conscious thing for Ron (at least it seemed so from the discussions) where he would pick stuff that had thematic potential. Like creating a speed quirk for a speedster---Com'on, creating an opposing trait to your character's "thing" is OBVIOUSLY going to cause issues.<br/><br/>This is somewhat different from creating a generic color element ("my guy likes t-shirts") and then trying to create a conflict out of it.                        </div>

                            Yep, this is me saying that I basically posted the same thing that Judson is saying in the thread from which this originally came. Terminology aside, there are things about characters that are passively interesting until they come into play. If a conflict occurs that concerns these things, they get brought into a more stark relief.<br/>
<br/>
Let's not look at Indy's whip, but at his Fedora. It's just "color" like Vader's cape, right? That is, until a door is dropping, and he's at risk of losing it. At which point the man risks his <i>hand</i> (and perhaps his life) on retrieving it.<br/>
<br/>
Anything about a character can become involved in a conflict at any time. Conflicts are resolved by the player saying something about the character that we didn't know before. We know Indy likes his hat. But we didn't know that he liked it that much (or, from another POV, that he makes such decisions about his posessions, when pressed).<br/>
<br/>
Abilities, quirks, whatever you want to call them, are not conflicts. But they're all grist for the conflict mill, potentially. Fred's note about "protected" character aspects noted.<br/>

                            In the parent discussion, I came to this idea with the notion that you could build a pretty robust system around the idea of picking two traits (from the same or different characters) and developing a conflict between them.  Could either be GM's situation generation, or a sans-GM Capes style conflict cards thing.  Move resources around between traits and conflicts, and there you go.  At first blush, that's what I pulled out of your example about Champions; could you provide a reference?<br><br>I continue to be fascinated about how Dogs continues to come up in what seemed to be <i>avant garde</i> conversations.                        </br></br></div>

                            My ramblings on the subject:<br><br>Interestingly the things that are being noted as quirks/color (I like "color" way better than "quirk") remonds me of "branding."  These are terms that are not really essential to what makes the character tick but it's what we associate with when we think of the character.  That color is all we really have to go on in the beginning until we throw them into the mix and they do stuff.  Then as they do more and more and their real "essence" is displayed (I'd posit, through conflict) then the color becomes THAT much more important because we associate those things to awesomeness we experienced through play.<br><br>I have a new Mu game we started.  The characters are fresh and they have a lot of color.  One of the characters has a Tell that's a tattoo on her chest.  It hasn't come into play and if we removed it at this point no one would notice or really care.  In fact, the player asked that we moved it to her back and I doubt anyone would blink an eye.  Introduce it into the story and "expose it to the elements" and if it gets moved someone would notice and say "wait a minute."<br><br>I would say that Wolverine is an excellent example of this.  As comics are want to do, Wolvie has changed costumes several times.  The yellow and blue was his "color" for the eighties (sorry I couldn't resist).  He changed the colors (in the 90s he went all civilian) but the character remained iconic.  Mostly because of the smoking, beer swilling and the claws - all aspects of the character that found it's way into the conflict of the story.<br/><br/>I think Coke had problems with branding in the eighties when they tried a new formula.  Not because New Coke was particularly different but because people bought COke based on the brand (My apologies for no references but I clearly recall reading scientific studies that showed that more people couldn't really tell the difference between Pepsi and Coke without seeing the can unless they religiously drank one or the other).  It's "branding" was what was in the thick of it, constantly challenged through advertising and name dropping.  It's substance - it's taste, it's texture - all became "color."<br/><br/>(In case it wasn't clear, in case someone is counting, I have to agree with Judson and company).<br/><br/>That all being said I think it's dangerous to say one is somehow devalued.  Color is important - it's just not essential <b>until</b> conflict arises and the color acts as a tool to associate the character with his actions.  <br/><br/>So does "focus on conflict" make boring characters?  I would say it makes characters, period.  Without conflict (ie without a game) even the color is sorta meaningless, no? I know, that the discussion on the other thread.  I just wanted to bring it around the the real point <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

Neel,<br/><br/>Sure.  Um... off the top of my head.  I'm a very dominant personality.  My default social action is to take charge.  This obviously causes friction in many circumstance.

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: neelk</cite>Thomas, honestly it sounds to me like you've just answered your own question.</blockquote>
Neel,<br/><br/>Perhaps.  I guess what I'm getting at is this: are these the same sort of thing?  Contrasting character-context with player-context is definitely a sort of contrast.  But it's something that we engage in with <i>any</i> form of media.  I think we always interpret things in light of ourselves.  So, is purely in-fiction contrast that same sort of contrast, or is it different?  (I'm not sure that this is really an important question, I'm just curious about it.)<br/><br/>Judson,<br/><br/>I want to look at what I take to be your main point, but to do that I'm going to have to restate what I think you're saying.  Let me know if this is a fair interpretation.<br/><br/>You want to distinguish between two things: 'traits' and 'quirks'.  Traits are aspects of a character that are used in conflicts or bear on them in some way (I'm not clear on whether an aspect that <i>could potentially</i> bear on a conflict counts as a trait or not).  Quirks are aspects of a character that either do not bear or at least have not yet played in to a conflict.<br/><br/>At first I wasn't sure what you were trying to get at with this distinction.  I'm willing to allow that you can make this split, but I don't see the point of doing so: why does it matter whether a given aspect of character is a trait or a quirk?  Then I went back and re-read your original post and you use the term 'mere quirk' for things that are not traits.  That seems to be a denegration.  Which is fine, really.  You seem to be saying that quirks just don't matter in play except in their potential to become traits later on.<br/><br/>Is that a fair summary?  Assuming it is, I've got some questions.<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            Thomas,<br/><br/>You've understood the objective facts of my assertion.  I think I have (generally) miscommunicated a subjective tint on quirks, traits, etc.  I'm trying to put a spotlight on what I'm calling traits.  In order to move into the pool of light from the darkness (of the universe of play that I'm ignoring for the time being, as opposed to generally unimportant stuff) a characteristic needs to be involved in conflict.  I make a personal aesthetic assertion (and I'm not entirely convinced that it's not a universal statement) that a character without traits is uninteresting.<br/><br/>Tim raised the important point that what I'm calling quirks here are essentially a special case of color, and color is important.  I do not dispute that point.  I just don't know that it bears directly on mine.  So denigrating quirks is like saying "just color," which isn't useful either.  Please read "are mere quirks" as "are color, and not cogent to my thread of reasoning at the moment."<br/><br/>As to "could potentially," the answer is sorta.  It depends on how you look at it.  You've got a brand new character, and everything on the sheet is quirks.  I might see potential for him to be cool, but if he never does anything, I'll never care.  So, from that point of view, no, characteristics that could potentially play into conflict are still quirks.  On the other hand, I think you can see that a quirk <em>might</em> become a trait, and select your quirks with that in mind.  And that there might be virtue to a system that reinforced the selections of quirks that will become traits, and the en-trait-ment of quirks.<br/><br/>Granted that that helps clarify rather than otherwise, I anxiously await your questions, as you're teaching me about my own train of thought here.                        </div>

                            Hi Judson,<br/><br/>I at least understand what you're getting at now, before I wasn't understanding what you wanted the focus to be.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judson Lester</cite>And that there might be virtue to a system that reinforced the selections of quirks that will become traits, and the en-trait-ment of quirks.</blockquote>
Anyway, this caught my eye. I wanted to say that I'm not sure if any systems do this overtly, but I sure believe it's common technique that players employ. I see it alot in <i>The Mountain Witch</i>. Players select Abilities that can potentially be used in thematic PvP conflicts (and here I distinguish mechanical conflicts from the overall thematic conflict of the game)... Actually, now that I think about it, I suggest this thing in the book, though I wasn't thinking in these terms when I wrote it... Something like, "Can turn to stone". Maybe that's just color, or maybe the player will find a way to make it significant to the plot. It certainly has potential.<br/><br/>But Abilities in tMW do have some sort of mechanical effect,so maybe they're not quite what you're talking about. (Are you familiar with the game?)                        </div>

                            Hey Tim!<br/><br/>Yeah.  I've had a lot of fun with <cite>The Mountain Witch,</cite> actually.  (Not a great very-first RPG, but otherwise excellent.)  I'm tempted to skin it with a different setting to get my current cadre to give it a shot, because I think there's a lot of value there that's being overlooked because of <em>somebody's</em> amity towards all things Japanese.  <br/><br/>Honestly, tMW is probably a really good example of the raft of games where this sort of encouragement happens without being coded into anything.  <br/><br/>And, for the record, I think "some mechanical effect" probably has exactly no impact on whether a characteristic is a quirk or a trait.  As has been raised, 20 skill points in Cryotank Operations doesn't mean a damn thing unless a cryotank is central to conflict somehow, (and is thus a quirk) and a side comment about how ugly a character is could feature in his every plot arc, even though it has no actual mechanical effect.<br/><br/>Putting it that way, I suddenly wonder if I'm not coming at character flags from the other side... Not to say it wouldn't be useful, but I wonder if traits aren't the qliphoth of flags...                        </div>

                            Judson,<br/><br/>I'm going to break this down, it might get messy and confused.  Apologies in advance.<br/><br/>The first thing you do is make an assertion (which you admit is personally aesthetic) that characters without traits are 'uninteresting'.  But later it seems as if you are implying that brand new characters can't have any because they haven't gotten into any conflicts yet.  So clearly something must be at work here.  I mean, there are some characters who I'm more excited to play than others even before the first session.  That's got to be tied up in potential stories or potential conflicts or potential <i>something</i>.<br/><br/>That means that you are either overstating when you say 'uninteresting' (and that you really mean 'less interesting', which is something I might be willing to buy), or...  I don't know, some characteristics are traits even if they haven't been in conflict yet.  Some clarity on this would be cool.<br/><br/>Let me see if I can phrase this question coherently....<br/><br/>What is it about 'engaging in conflict' that makes something a trait?  It seems to me that it can't be something as mundane as 'helps you succeed in getting what you want out of a conflict' (whether it's winning or losing).  That seems off somehow.<br/><br/>But if the important thing about traits isn't that they help you win it seems that the only thing going on is that they must be <i>shown</i>.  And I might buy that, but it sounds like you're getting at something more significant.  So, what is it that traits <i>do</i> in conflicts?<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thomas Robertson</cite><br/>Perhaps.  I guess what I'm getting at is this: are these the same sort of thing?  Contrasting character-context with player-context is definitely a sort of contrast.  But it's something that we engage in with<i>any</i>form of media.  I think we always interpret things in light of ourselves.  So, is purely in-fiction contrast that same sort of contrast, or is it different?  (I'm not sure that this is really an important question, I'm just curious about it.)<br/></blockquote>
<br/>My original post was just about the fiction, but you've reminded me that part of the reason I like seeing players try on radically different character concepts is that the pattern of interactions we adopt with each other will change, and that's neat to watch. <br/><br/>I want to say it's not really important whether they're the same or different, except that I think that it's important that in rpgs the players are author and audience simultaneously, and I feel (not think) there's a relationship.                        </div>

I meant something very specific by "uninteresting," for which I paid the word and extra bob and sixpence (a phrase I'm expecting Graham to correct me on).<br/><br/>I this case, what I was recalling was Tony's original idea of wanting to see Spiderman on a good day, or the crew of Serenity chilling out with nothing going wrong.  I'm specifically talking about the difference between the awesome character that you just wrote up that you are <em>so jazzed</em> to start playing because he looks so cool and the character you've played for a year (or a session, whatever) that you're in love with because you really are engaged with him.  The difference between telling you about Malcolm Reynold's nifty qualities (he's an ex-captian of a galactic rebellion) and you seeing them ("When you can run, you crawl, and when you can crawl, you find someone to carry you.")  I think either you agree that there's a quality that the later character's have as a result of actually being in play that the former don't, or I won't be able to make my point.<br/><br/>So that's what I meant by uninteresting.  (I've gotta find a better way to start these "I've got a nifty idea that's half formed" conversations...)
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thomas Robertson</cite>What is it about 'engaging in conflict' that makes something a trait?

I hope I've been clear enough on that point.  I've been talking about a more story level conflict in this discussion.  Things that don't necessarily get resolved, and take a while to build up and close out regardless.<br/><br/>So, traits can be involved in a conflict in at least the following ways:
<ol><li>As a component of the conflict itself (e.g. my pride versus your need to help)</li><li>Contributing to an existing conflict (e.g. your position in society makes it easier for you to give or force your help on me)</li><li>Helping to frame scenes that involve the conflict (e.g. my huge sword facilitates a fight with my creditors)</li><li>Helping to conclude conflicts (e.g. my assassin's guild membership and the Night The Moneylenders Mysteriously Died)</li></ol>
Don't take that list as gospel, since I'd cheerfully admit that items could merge, drop, be added or split.                        </div>

Okay.  To make sure I'm on the same page, you're talking about the difference between showing and telling, right?<br/><br/>If I'm right in reading that, it strikes me that it may not be conflict you're worried about at all (here I go projecting, you have been warned!).  Could it be that what you're really looking at is how people show things (rather than tell them), and conflating that with conflict?<br/><br/>Or, perhaps more interestingly, even <i>equating</i> it with conflict?  That is, could you be suggesting something along the lines of the idea that showing <i>must</i> happen through conflicts?  I might be convinced of that.  Maybe.  But I'm not even sure if that's what you're saying.<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            Thomas,<br/><br/>It's possible that there is no meaningful difference between what I'm suggesting and an admonition against exposition.  Let me see if I can tease one out though.  In a role playing game, one usually produces a character from whole cloth - sometimes as a complete or partial steal from another story, even another session of play.  Leaving aside the games where this is not the case, you necessarily are telling us a lot about this character.  Without scripting out play in advance, there's little you can do to show anything about this brand new character.  You could tell a little story about them, but I tend to think that too much story before play is bad form.  (I'm thinking of a very specific example that I don't want to get into at the moment.)<br/><br/>It's possible that I'm conflating conflict with demonstration.  I've admitted elsewhere that I prefer that the one serve the other.  Certainly, we can roleplay conversation over coffee, and demonstrate our characters' wit, or political leanings.  But far more interesting, to me, is if that demonstration is in the course of establishing, advancing or resolving a conflict.  <br/><br/>And I'll suggest, completely <i>ad hoc</i> that demonstrations that don't connect to a conflict won't stick as well.  We won't remember that scene over coffee where my character told dirty jokes about Bill Clinton, unless it happens that he got the joke from your character's wife during their nooner in the cheap hotel across the way.                        </div>

                            Judson,<br/><br/>The reason I'm getting to all this goes back to an example I posted in that thread of Tony's that kicked this one off:<br/><br/>I've got this character who acts like a big sister.  It's never really come up in an official conflict (rolling dice and stuff), but it's something that really sticks out to me.  The scene that really drove it home for me was this one where she was comforting one of the other PCs whose boyfriend had been disappeared (murdered?).<br/><br/>I can't really see a conflict there, but it was definitely a show-not-tell moment.  So, if you're talking about traits being things shown and quirks being things told, I'm on board with that.  If you're talking about the sort of thing in my example being conflict in the literary sense (and thus making the big sisterness a trait not a quirk), I <i>might</i> be on board with that, but that does seem to be an awfully broad definition of 'conflict'.  If you want to say that that's not a conflict, but that you're willing to bet that the big sisterness has come into play in other conflicts and that I'm mistaken about the parts of play that make the trait cool, I might buy that too, but it'd require some discussion.  If you want to say that it's not a conflict and thus the big sisterness isn't a trait and thus is 'uninteresting' (man we need a better word for this idea), well, you can't be right about that!<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">
<div class="QuoteText">I came to this idea with the notion that you could build a pretty robust system around the idea of picking two traits (from the same or different characters) and developing a conflict between them.</div>
</blockquote>
Well, consider that I wrote a whole game system that's pretty much nothing but this concept called Synthesis. Very simple Hegelian stuff, one trait is the Thesis, another the Antithesis, and the product of the conflict the Synthesis. Here's an old version:<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.swcp.com/~tquid/synthesis.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.swcp.com/~tquid/synthesis.html</a><br/>
<br/>
(If you want the newer version join Indie Netgaming and get it from the file section there).<br/>
<br/>
So, yeah, I think it's more than doable. :-)<br/>
<br/>
That said, I think that it's a somewhat simplistic model, and that conflicts are potentially much more multivariate in form. In discussing bangs (which are essentially about setting up conflicts), I've said that the most obvious form is what I call the "Dilemma Bang." In this sort of conflict, the character has a choice between two obvious choices. Usually when you create the conflict from two "quirks," this is what results.<br/>
<br/>
For example, the most obvious way to build a conflict is to have two character relationbships, and have the characters related to have opposing goals. Character A wants X, and Character B wants Y, and X and Y are mutually exclusive, and only the PC can decide. In which case he's deciding which relationship to support, and which to dissapoint.<br/>
<br/>
But, again, this is just the most obvious way to go. Also obviously you can create more choices simply by adding in more traits. A third character in the above mix means at least a third choice. And, actually, can mean more choices if it's possible to select two of three in a solution.<br/>
<br/>
But less obviously you can create conflicts from only one trait, put into opposition with itself. For example, if you take the example of the character being a great swordsman, he could be given a decision where he has to choose between accepting either a well fashioned sword, or the training of a great master. So we can see that the options provided to one trait can be many-to-one, not just one-to-one. This is dependent on situation creation, instead of selection of traits.<br/>
<br/>
Also there are cases where situation may impact a large number of traits all at once in a non-specific way. The example I usually give here is dropping a lot of wealth on the character suddenly. Does his "Charitable" kick in, and he gives it to charity. Does "swordsman" get selected, and he buys a great sword? Or the training of a great master? Does he give it to his family? Does he split the wealth, and give some to each? How much to each?<br/>
<br/>
This sort of conflict is often more satisfying than the dilemma, because it allows a wider range of expression. This is the one-to-many situation - one situation element bringing in many traits.<br/>
<br/>
Then there are composites. Help Character A and feel good about oneself, or help Character B, and get a lot of wealth and figure out how to spend it. A basic dilemma, but with one choice bringing in the one-to-many case.<br/>
<br/>
There's nothing wrong with very simple, straightforward dilemmas. They're often very powerful. And, in fact, there are often more choices than may at first seem to present themselves (like the classic "walk away", "won't choose," "delay," or "none of the above" choices). And they're easy to come up with. But for advanced conflict creation, look for situation to drop on characters that have more complex decisions.<br/>

I think I'd need a lot more context on the incident, to be honest.  I mean, if it was "Oh, your boyfriend disappeared?  Have some non-specific comfort" with trimmings, that strikes me a quirk.  If the injured character gained real strength, or even was made more aware of how bad things were, then, yeah, you synthesized (thank you, Mike) your big-sister trait into that lit conflict.                        </div>
