I have also made the choice to replace cleric as the buff class with the alchemist whose rules are found at the <a href="http://www.koboldenterprise.com/?p=16" rel="nofollow">blog</a>. <br/>The next thing will be the spell list and alchemist list in one book, use the normal arcane book for now, and then the gm guide. For those who got a chance to see the, terrible, first draft the dogs in the vineyard has been switched out for some LBB sexy. No worries though a much simpler version of the dogs implementation will be included in the gm guide.<br/><br/>I figured I might as well post this here since some people from story games showed interest in the concepts proposed.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
