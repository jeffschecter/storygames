Apparently Lydia and Brenna have been talking about it non-stop since we did character creation last week. They had several pages of handwritten ideas. I need to find a way to bottle some of their enthusiasm and inject it into some of my other friends via hypodermic needle or something.<br/><br/>I did something that seemed, I don't know, <i>wrong</i>. So many games are like "make sure everyone's there when you make characters, nobody go off and do your own thing, etc. etc." At chargen, they got halfway through their characters, Chancel and Imperator didn't get made, so I said, "Tell you guys what. Just finish everything up without me. Next week I'll come here, I'll sit down and read everything for a few minutes, and then we'll start." I run games completely by the seat of my pants anyway so whatever. But it still felt like I was breaking some sort of taboo.<br/><br/>But it worked out great. I came back and they were excited and had, like, a list of NPCs for me that they wanted to see, and had fleshed out the setting and some other Imperators. I sat down real quick, came up with three ideas to sort of set the stage, and we ran.<br/><br/>They're playing the Nobles of Motion and Water, and they live in a Chancel that's this huge swirling whirlpool of water with people living on the roofs of submerged sunken buildings. I decided the first session would be kind of Chancel focused so I sketched out three quick situations for them to deal with.<br/><br/>- The people of the Chancel appeal to them to help them build a proper city.<br/>- A woman begins to worship them and revere them.<br/>- An enemy chancel sends in some spies (in the form of a boat full of clowns).<br/><br/>It was low impact but they enjoyed it. They have plans now to use miracles to dry out some marshland to build an ice city on it. They haven't determined that the clowns are spies yet (I made them as suspicious as possible so next ssession I'm going to escalate them a bit). The woman who worships them was sent in to infiltrate the clowns as a spy.<br/><br/>Additionally, they gave me a neat NPC to play. The Noble of Water gave a Water Spirit human intelligence, and they quickly became really invested in him. His new intelligence made just splashing around no longer satisfying, so he's seeking out new meaning to his life. They're already talking about making another water spirit intelligent because he seems lonely. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>Next session I want to nail some of their personal projects like building some allegiances, and I think there will be a party where they can shmooze.<br/><br/>Oh, and my favorite moment of the session. Their Chancel is weak and failing, and it has something of a personality. The Noble of Motion said, with regard to the boat full of clowns, "The Chancel imported clowns? Must be a coping mechanism."<br/><br/>I might just ditch my spy plans to make that the case.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_169819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169819/#Comment_169819" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-18T07:38:41+00:00" title="September 18, 2008  7:38AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Delicious.

Because as with many rules around creative activities they have good reason for existing. And as with many rules self-directing adults should be able to break them when they have reason too. Its one of the things writers have to learn, to the point that its a cliche in creative writing classes, you have to know the rules so you can know when to break them. <br/><br/>In this case the fact that the players did it together, and then handed the GM the world that he was to run (in a real way), is great and explains a lot of why things worked for your group's style. <br/><br/>Also, RPGs need more clowns. This is my new rule.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_169856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169856/#Comment_169856" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-18T09:55:32+00:00" title="September 18, 2008  9:55AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bret Gillan</cite>They're playing the Nobles of Motion and Water, and they live in a Chancel that's this huge swirling whirlpool of water</blockquote>\nGame sounds rocking, but that line right there, <i>that</i> Chancel for <i>those</i> Nobles?
