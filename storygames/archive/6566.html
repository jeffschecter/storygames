I'm in awe of the amount of work you have done. Could you put a link to the mp3 in the review?<br/><br/>However, I really don't care which podcasts I shouldn't listen to. Negativity is kind of a turn-off for me.<br/><br/>One of my mantras is "no evaluation with generation" since it discourages people from creating new stuff out of fear of judgment. This is very common among people who have studied creativity theory and idea generation methods. In this community (as in all others), it's very important that we focus on encouraging folks to create new stuff rather than discouraging them from creating.<br/><br/>I'd take a different, more positive approach. Ironically, we have to read through all the negative bits to get to the parts we should actually pay attention to. Why not simply list the must listens and must reads? I'd make it a daily read.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_145679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ColinC" title="ColinC"><img alt="ColinC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ColinC">ColinC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145679/#Comment_145679" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-23T10:07:10+00:00" title="May 23, 2008 10:07AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Stoughton</cite><br/>Can anyone suggest a blog or podcast season that I should do next?</blockquote>\n<a href="http://stoughton.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">The Cull</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145688">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145688/#Comment_145688" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-23T10:25:54+00:00" title="May 23, 2008 10:25AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brennen, what would you think of me putting a "What made the cut?" section at the top?

But take <i>Sons of Kryos</i> - Judd's an affable guy and he's the first to admit that they had some learning to do.  So saying "I listened critically and 90% of this sucks" accomplishes the same thing that "I listened critically and here's the truly great 10%" would.  People will only view it as your greatest hits track if you also suck.  If you really are critical and provide useful commentary, it doesn't matter if you are positive or negative.  Given that, why on earth be negative?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_145771">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145771/#Comment_145771" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-23T15:51:18+00:00" title="May 23, 2008  3:51PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chipping away at the things that suck is what I'm doing - you're really seeing my thought process in those posts.<br/><br/>But also, it's easier.  A lot easier.

(that\u2019s not a rhetorical question)<br/><br/>(aside - I try to mention what my purposes are in the pages linked off the top of the blog, but it's no more complex than "I get frustrated when looking for resources to make my game or my game design better.  If you have the same frustration I'm trying to smooth the way for you.")<br/><br/>(aside 2 - I picked the Sons of Kryos as my first target because I love their podcast.

And in a sense, this is kind of what you're offering. Only the flavour isn't to my taste at all. I'll start with the name.<br/><br/>The name makes me very uncomfortable. Calling it <b>The Cull</b> is totalising and eliminativist. The <b>The</b> makes it totalising; it suggests that there is a clearly right set of content that should exist in the storygames/indie community, and this is going to be the source of it all. The <b>Cull</b> makes it eliminativist, and carries some chiding alongside; it suggests that the indie community is composed of a lot of stuff that basically shouldn't still exist, that should have been removed (ie by the community) but wasn't, and that you're stepping up to the perform the tough job that the community didn't have the stomach for.<br/>...<br/><br/>I've just noticed, that not only is it called The Cull, but you in your "About" page you refer to the activity you are engaged in as "Culling". Given that, everything in the previous paragraph goes twice. Reviewing or reflecting or opinionating on something is a very different thing from culling. It's a great mindshare technique to associate your brand with an activity (ask Google or Hoover), but I would ask you to consider the problematic freighting of this term.<br/><br/><br/>The other thing that makes me uneasy is your positioning of what the blog is for - namely, to direct the wider interest to the right stuff. I honestly don't believe that this sector is mature enough for anyone to take the  perspective of objective "consumer interest defender". We're a bunch of smart excitable people with opinions. Heck, even Vincent (who's done the rounds and earned his chops) prefaces anyway with the notion that this is his particular perspective on what he (and some others) want from roleplaying.<br/><br/> The thing is, you can justify all kinds of brusqueness and ungenerosity in the name of the supposed consumer/greater good.You seem to have distanced yourself from the effects the Cull may have on the people you review. I can't shake the feeling that you're posing it as some kind of supreme natural selection process: the pressures it imposes <i>might</i> lead to better work the authors. But if it does end up as a discouragement, well, that was never the primary concern, which is the future of the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">species</span> sector.<br/><br/>As I think I've made clear, a lot of this comes down to positioning and your longer-term objectives for this. Insofar as we need more sifting for the gold in the community, I'm grateful for your efforts. As I look through the content of what you've done for SoK, post-recommendations from others, I think this could be a useful resource. You'd have to ask Judd what impact, if any, it's had on him. But, as you're going to be moving onto other things, and other people, I figure this is the time to query a little bit what this is supposed to be about. Is this <b>Ryan's Faves, Tips and Advice on Improvement</b>, or <b>The Long Overdue Correction in the Indie RPG Market from the Invisible Hand</b>? Because it's screaming the latter to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145922">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145922/#Comment_145922" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-25T04:56:50+00:00" title="May 25, 2008  4:56AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alex F</cite>The name makes me very uncomfortable.

I was never very serious about it, and I'm very busy, so it would probably never happen.<br/><br/>As soon as I read The Cull, any possibility for me ever doing a gaming-related podcast flew out the window.<br/><br/>When I was a kid, the adults (the squares) would tell me my shitty garage punk sucked. It did, but they didn't know what they were talking about so I told them to fuck off. Now I'm a jazz musician, and I teach jazz and blues guitar as a profession. If Thurston Moore told me I sucked, I'd probably be driving a desk. If Thurston gave me a negativity sandwich: a very positive statement first, then a constructive suggestion on what could make my weaknesses stronger, and finished with an encouraging statement that will inspire me to keep creating...then well, much more shitty music, but at least I'll learn with experience.<br/><br/>If some gaming square (who plays a particular game I don't care for in a manner i don't enjoy) critiques my podcast...well, middle finger. But I like and respect Ryan, and he's done important things to try to bring this community together. In a way, Ryan is like the Thurston Moore too my potential gaming podcast.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145930/#Comment_145930" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-25T09:02:42+00:00" title="May 25, 2008  9:02AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alex F</cite>Calling it<b>The Cull</b>is totalising and eliminativist.</blockquote>I'm trying to answer this question: "When I eliminate the stuff that's boring, or meandering, or unrelated to gaming, what remains?"  I'm going to approach it from my own perspective without spending a lot of time on what that perspective is (i.e. what I said to Jason about credibility, above).<br/><br/>This blog means I'm coming through literally thousands of pages of text and hundreds of hours of podcasts.  I mean, look at <a href="http://www.lumpley.com/archive/144.html" rel="nofollow">this post</a> on anyway.  That post alone - including each actual play thread - is an investment of several hours.<br/><br/>As Graham pointed out, it's much easier to focus on the negative.  That can be a good thing - it's easier, when combing through a large volume of things - to eliminate those that meet definitive, easily identified criteria.  I can't go through everything looking for ways it might be worth keeping; that would take eons for me, although a really nice guy might be able to do it.  But as Levi pointed out, I don't need to present what goes on in the abbatoir (that's why I reformatted and took a lot of that stuff out).<br/><br/>I'm calling it The Cull because that's how I'm going about it, and I'd be disingenuous if I Culled and then called it "Diamonds in the Rough."  When people see the Cull, and that big ol' public domain axe, they know exactly how I'm going about the blog's purpose.  I'm putting on my totalising, eliminativist hat (crown) and separating out the wheat from the chaff.<br/><br/>But I understand why that would be uncomfortable.  However, if you put up something in public and claim to have achieved some purpose with it, I think it's natural for someone to come along and, finding some places where you missed that purpose, point at the places you really nailed it.  <br/><br/>Where you paraphrase me here, you're spot on, as long as you start with <i>If you're reading to make your game better then...</i><blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alex F</cite>the indie community is composed of a lot of stuff that basically shouldn't still exist, that should have been removed (ie by the community) but wasn't</blockquote>But that's not the only reason blogs exist.  If you're reading to keep up on what your friends are doing, or looking back on how things came to be the way they are, or what your favorite designers are/were working on, that's a whole other purpose.  You won't find that other purpose in the Cull.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alex F</cite>The other thing that makes me uneasy is your positioning of what the blog is for - namely, to direct the wider interest to the right stuff. I honestly don't believe that this sector is mature enough for anyone to take the  perspective of objective "consumer interest defender".</blockquote>I disagree.  While blogging is new, and so is gaming, looking critically at a text and whether it achieves a given purpose isn't new.  <br/><br/>"Does this block of text address its topic?" i.e. "Is it about gaming?"<br/>"Is this block of text too short or too long, given what its topic is?"<br/>"Does it stay on topic or meander off?"<br/>"Do the notes which follow this text address its topic, another relevant topic, provide insight that's related to the topic, and so on?"<br/>"Is there anything else in this text - such as humor or use of examples - that helps it stand out from drier examples of the same topic?"<br/><br/>These are questions I feel qualified to answer - and if you disagree, and think I'm missing something crucial by using my method, that's fine.  You're welcome to tell me what I missed, or you can do all the work I've done in parallel using a different methodology.  If you decide to go through the full first season of Sons of Kryos, I'd be surprised if you didn't think Episode 8 was the best one, that many of the segments were only concerned with things happening at the time, and so on.  I'm not going to claim that my opinion is the only one possible - not at least until I see a few more gold idols.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_145931">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145931/#Comment_145931" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-25T09:31:30+00:00" title="May 25, 2008  9:31AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Brennan - I'm trying to do something more like Clem Greenburg as portrayed in <i>Pollock</i> (the Ed Harris movie).  He (the real guy Clem Greenburg) wrote art criticism for a column in the Nation.<br/><br/>If you looked at Clem's notes on Pollock you'd find several pieces that say "Same as #12"  "Not as good as Clyfford Still" or "You can tell that by the time he hit the lower half that his arm was really tired."  <br/><br/>He might like Pollock, he might be friends with Pollock, but his job as an art critic is to tell people whether and when Pollock created something worth looking at.  <br/><br/>Before Clem meets Pollock, Pollock paints.  Maybe it's a personal expression, but in time if it's held up by painters as this massively influential work that is worthy of painters' attention, that will probably draw Clem's attention.  Clem's going to criticize it because he knows how and he's filling a need (there are thousands of painters in America).  If Pollock paints better because of that criticism it's a great, but unintended outcome.  If Pollock doesn't paint because Clem's out there, that's a sad unintended outcome.  If Clem's readers find great art as a result of his column, he's getting his intended outcome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145934">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145934/#Comment_145934" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-25T10:13:01+00:00" title="May 25, 2008 10:13AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            People need to be, like, less defensive about potentially people whose potential feelings might be hurt by something Ryan will potentially say.<br/>\n<br/>\nGraham is offering good advice about how to write good reviews.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems like some people are taking offense at the idea of reviews at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems, then, that Ryan's blog is <i>not for you</i>.<br/>\n<br/>\nLikewise, it is not for me.

of The Cull, I see Ryan's idea (and results so far) very promising and potentially very useful to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd maybe I don't know Mr. Stoughton well enough, but anything he is going to potentially say about my potential creative work probably won't make a difference in whether I'm going to produce some more stuff or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhether or not Ryan intends it, one possible result of this blog could be that some bloggers and podcasters will strive for higher quality stuff in order to make The Cull (can you say that? Or should I say survive the Cull? Nevermind.). That's not a bad thing at all but it will only happen if The Cull becomes an influential source.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, to put it short, I'm with Ben Lehman and Judd.

I mean I've already listened to the whole of SoK and enjoyed it enough to keep coming back for each podcast, but I can see that the sheer quantity of episodes is pretty intimidating to someone who wants to get into it right now.  When I started listening to it there were I think 12 episodes.  That took a little over a  week of journeys to work and back to get me caught up.  There are now 5 times as many, over a month's worth.  I'd probably just skip the entire back catalogue in all honesty unless someone pointed out some juicy nuggets.
