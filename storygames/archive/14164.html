This game is very simple.  I sometimes want something more complicated but, less and less often.  I also want tension and the pleasure of not knowing what will happen next.  This game has both by providing its authors' enormous <i>alternating</i> authority.</b><br/><br/>I got to play Microscope only after it took book form, but I've really enjoyed my few plays of it.  One one of the main reasons I enjoy it and, I think, one of its primary strengths, is this utilization of the power of Strong and then No Authority.  It may share no other qualities with S/Lay w/Me but it definitely shares this element.<br/><br/>I've appreciated this this same quality in the performance of long-form improv.  It's obviously present to varying degree in a variety of GM-less/full games.<br/><br/>I just wanted to say that I find this quality powerful and want to see more of it.  More of it as it's explicitly called out in GM-less/full games (some have more of a "narration-stands-as-long-as-that's-cool-with-everyone flavor" and some even have some kind of mechanical safety valve built in to override potential "problems" with this form of play), and more of it even in games with a traditional GM role of some sort.  Maybe especially in those kinds of games as I haven't seen much of that.<br/><br/>I played "A Penny For My Thoughts" only once, and then only in late playtest.  It's not a game I'm personally tempted to bring to a table often, but I'd like to see more designs that are influenced by it and the improv forms that were among its catalysts.<br/><br/>I want more "Play Unsafe".  Consider designing with even more trust for me and others as we come to your game.  Some really good play comes out this approach. <br/><br/>I recognize lots of games in this community take something approximating this approach.  I'm simply saying "Bravo!  More!"  Get as extreme with that approach as Microscope does.  More "GM-full" and less "GM-less".  Let narration stand.  "Best is: make it irrevocable."  <br/><br/>Let freedom ring.  Then chains.  Now back to freedom.  Now chains.  Freedom.  Chains.  I'm on a horse.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
