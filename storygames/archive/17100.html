This was one big nostalgia trip and brought me back to when I was 15. Not just because the setting is based off of a prequel to Blizzard's Diablo but the play style of the game.<br/><br/>In this podcast you will hear familiar names from the series and even new stuff that the players themselves brought into the game! I have to say it has been a fun night and I cannot wait till next week. This was suppose to be a test run but the session was so fun I had to post it.<br/><br/>Just remember to "Stay awhile and listen!"<br/><br/>[Explict]<br/><br/><a href="http://rpgbg.blogspot.ca/2012/08/actual-play-dungeon-world-session-1.html" rel="nofollow">http://rpgbg.blogspot.ca/2012/08/actual-play-dungeon-world-session-1.html</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
