It happens in fleeting moments, usually when we're moving fast and furious through a scene and don't have too much time to think.  When something happens, you just blurt out what your character would do or say.  Then someone cracks a joke or references something outside the game and the immersion flits away.  <br/><br/>I see it as something similar to reaching enlightenment.  It only comes to you in fleeting glimpses, but those moments can be very special.  It means that you've transcended the rules of the system and actually managed to step outside of yourself for a moment.  It can never last, but those times are some of your truly special role-playing moments.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105705/#Comment_105705" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-31T11:32:22+00:00" title="October 31, 2007 11:32AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wel, I hate the common definition that says immersion means when a player is playing the character and not thinking meta at all.  So maybe this question isn't for me.<br/><br/>For me, immersion is about being in the fictional space and connecting to the fiction on a personal level.  It's a step beyond suspending disbelief, which is forgetting about some construct to enjoy the fiction.<br/><br/>I hate the common definition because I get immersed regardless of whether I also am thinking about things on a meta level.  When I'm worried what might happen to a family connection I have to a character, even though I might be the one making them suffer because there's a mechanical advantage to it.  Immersion is what RPGs are ALL about.  If I wasn't immersed, it would feel like a board game. But it doesn't.  I'll hesitate on getting that mechanical advantage (or whatever) because I'm immersed in the fiction.  Sometimes I'll push it, not just because of the mechanical advantage, but because it's a better story for it (and, like a harrowing book or movie, I hope and pray there's a way out of the hole that's being dug).<br/><br/>I don't know if that helps.

No one seems to be able to pin down what that is. <br/><br/>I'm all for immersion as something people do when they role-play. It's great!<br/><br/>I'm not all for people using their love and quest for immersion to shut down other techniques or, especially, discussions about what the heck it is, how to achieve it, when to use it and so on. Some few people and discussions I've seen over the years view immersion as the ultimate destination and the "why" of why they role-play, and get defensive when people try to examine it, as though the examination ruins the magic or something. That's weird to me. (Even weirder to me is why this topic, immersion, would be controversial. To me, it's sorta like saying "Hey! Fuck off you guys who want to roll dice in cups.

Some have found this definition useful, but others have not. So "Immersion in setting" means you can introduce setting elements without hesitation or contemplation; "Immersion in system" means you can roll the dice and manipulate the mechanics  reflexively; "Immersion in character" means you can speak for and act out the behavior of the character completely automatically - "think as the character."<br/><br/>Strong immersion in character can have the side effect of a partial sense of loss of self and identity. This experience I'd describe as "transcendental" and feels similar to meditation.<br/><br/>As others have said, there are other definitions out there and its not clear everything falls under the umbrella and whether there is a tight relationship between them. For example, some describe "zoning out" while reading a book, or watching a movie as a kind of immersion. I'm not sure if these experiences are really covered by my definition, and feel like very different subjective experiences to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105726">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alan" title="Alan"><img alt="Alan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alan">Alan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105726/#Comment_105726" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-31T12:41:11+00:00" title="October 31, 2007 12:41PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 31, 2007 12:42PM by Alan.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Over the years of reading RPG forums, I have seen "immersion" used for several different things. I think they break down into: actor-stance-only play, theatrical-play-only, noticability of system consultation, consistency of the shared-imagined-space, just plain old engagement, and any combination of these.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn actor-stance-only play, players play their character's solely based on the personality of the character.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn theatrical-play-only, players restrict their real-world interactions to in-character speech and gestures as much as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith unintrusive system consultation, the players either know the relevent rules well enough to use them smoothly and unintrusively or they minimize or eschew existing rules to avoid consulting them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy consistency of the shared-imagined-space, I mean how much the fantasy spun by the group lives up to a particular player's expectations (whether that's "historical accuracy" or "true to Tolkein" or even internal consistency).<br/>\n<br/>\nEngagement is the common human experience of enjoyable concentration that humans get when engaging in an interesting task.

I've tried to use the self-proclaimed word character-immersion for the stuff I'm fond of, which essentially aims to focus on the player identifiying to the character, and forgetting the player as an external person who can influence the fiction. I'm passingly familiar with other forms of immersion, like immersing to the story in general, but those don't provide the kicks I'm after.<br/><br/>Here's <a href="http://merten.kapsi.fi/rpg/?p=111" rel="nofollow">a sketchy attempt of trying to define how immersion works for me</a>. I'm prone to think that even people who are after the same kicks do the immersion-fu differently; it's a personal technique that works differently for different players.<br/><br/>I don't think that character immersion mixes well with too many other techniques or styles of play; it's pretty exclusive technique. I wouldn't mind seeing other techniques that would work with it, but due to the exclusive nature of it, they are pretty hard to make work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105729">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105729/#Comment_105729" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-31T12:49:52+00:00" title="October 31, 2007 12:49PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I third the motion that immersion covers a large swath of play experience.  Hence all the wrangles.  \n<blockquote>The functional definition I use is "Immersion in x means you can manipulate x subconsciously, reflexively, automatically without resorting to reflection or conscious thought."</blockquote>\nSounds right on.<br/><br/>I like it best when folks talk about what kind of immersion: character immersion makes sense, immersion in story, flow of play via system is completely possible.  I suspect that what's really being talked about is a deep level of engagement with the game, that loss of self is talked about when one is fully engaged with any fulfilling creative task: painting, music, conversation. Or even simple tasks that take our whole body and mind, like running or martial arts.  We get that in role playing when we are firing on all cylinders. What does that for you will vary.

A topic I feel 110% confident in discussing. First, I'm gonna cobble together some things I've said over the last couple of days on this wonderful forum.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jarrod</cite>Many, many times, what starts as a d20 Modern Supercops game turns into a Euro-LARP, with players so in character that they burst into tears when we find their wife dead at the crime scene. We had one player in a Battletech game who became so distraught over his best friend's death that we spent an entire session in mourning, and then he (both in game and out) disappeared. Keep in mind that the player whose character died was pleased to no end at how the situation resolved; he immediately grabbed an NPC which he'd played as in some scenes, and went to each PC asking them to tell him their favorite stories about the character. This took us about<i>three sessions</i>to work through, and the PC had only been there for<i>four sessions</i>to begin with.<br/><br/>So yeah, we give XP for nervous breakdowns.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jarrod</cite>If I don't feel emotionally conflicted in the room, even as a GM, then I'm not roleplaying.<br/><br/>Dice, points, all that stuff is super fun. And a lot of roleplaying I do<i>isn't fun at all</i>, in the cognitive sense inspiring joy and entertainment. Somehow we've evolved our small but growing player pool from hack and/or slash to deep psychological trauma as entertainment. I have a homebrew system I've made where all hits automatically succeed as killing blows...<i>then you roll to emotionally recover from having hurt another living creature</i>.<br/><br/>I think that's right on the edges of most people's roleplaying, simply because it isn't a fun thing to do; but we all hug afterwards and feel a lot more emotionally healthy; and our wives and families have suddenly found themselves encouraging us to spend another hour or two at the Lacuna game if it somehow means we'll sleep better at night. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/></blockquote>\nI've come to realize that our collective mini-school of thought in my RP group is miles away from what others think of as "immersive roleplaying." I almost think that Immersion is recognized only when you unplug. It's hard to even tell when you're immersed unless it's made as a conscious effort, which we've begun to casually enforce. <br/><br/>I guess I'll go out on a limb and define True Immersion as a collective decision to focus on characterization until it becomes another aspect of one's self, akin to a group decision to incorporate the shared imagined space into a personal hypnosis. This is why in our games, each player plays themselves, with one page of edits and exceptions to our own personalities and histories.<br/><br/>I think that immersive play and immersion are two things. I'm well aware that we're barely even qualifying as a game; and I think that the definition we're searching for lies in the treatment of sharedspace as a imagined <i>story</i> or an imagined <i>spiritual reality</i>. I think one's take on Dualism, Solipsism, and the Tao are probably integral to understanding the silly crap I spout about when I talk about us "thinking about it" versus "soaking in it."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105794">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Shevaun" title="Shevaun"><img alt="Shevaun" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Shevaun">Shevaun</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105794/#Comment_105794" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-31T17:31:42+00:00" title="October 31, 2007  5:31PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alan</cite>Over the years of reading RPG forums, I have seen "immersion" used for several different things. I think they break down into: actor-stance-only play, theatrical-play-only, noticability of system consultation, consistency of the shared-imagined-space, just plain old engagement, and any combination of these.<br/><br/>In actor-stance-only play, players play their character's solely based on the personality of the character.<br/><br/>In theatrical-play-only, players restrict their real-world interactions to in-character speech and gestures as much as possible.<br/><br/>With unintrusive system consultation, the players either know the relevent rules well enough to use them smoothly and unintrusively or they minimize or eschew existing rules to avoid consulting them.<br/><br/>By consistency of the shared-imagined-space, I mean how much the fantasy spun by the group lives up to a particular player's expectations (whether that's "historical accuracy" or "true to Tolkein" or even internal consistency).<br/><br/>Engagement is the common human experience of enjoyable concentration that humans get when engaging in an interesting task. Any game or activity that pushes the right buttons for an individual can have this and this is what we're all looking for.<br/><br/>I think the primary misunderstanding is mistaking one of the first four for the last one.</blockquote>\nI would agree that immersion doesn't have to be totally a character driven thing. The fight you have that flows so smoothly that at the end of it you can barely remember picking up the dice, just the cut and flow if combat, isn't some sort of improv acting and characterisation experience, though the experience does become inextricably bonded to the character which was being portrayed as being involved in the fight. Its not just pure engagement because there is often little sense of consciously deciding on the mechanics and their effects during that fight. It is immersion, but it relies on the players knowing the system well enough to apply them without having to ponder them. This aspect leads me to believe that part of the reason for so many story games having such relatively simple systems is to allow immersion to happen very quickly, after the state of engagement has been reached and passed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105809">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105809/#Comment_105809" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-31T18:52:30+00:00" title="October 31, 2007  6:52PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alvin Frewer</cite>For me, immersion is about being in the fictional space and connecting to the fiction on a personal level.

Immersion is hard thing for people to define precisely because it involves internal emotional states, things that we, as humans, aren't particularly equipped to describe.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>To be a giant nerd for a minute, think of your brain as a computer. It runs an operating system that controls your shit, and your personality is a program it always runs. Trying to identify with the emotional state of another person - empathizing - is something you do all day, and you do it by setting up a similar program in your mind. It's a simpler and cruder version of your own personality program, but it resembles it. You run this off to the side and look at it and go, oh, ok, I know how to react now.<br/><br/>Playing a role is even harder, because you don't have as clear a picture of what that person is - they're imaginary. Still, same thing - run the program and look. Immersion is that point when you've built that program up to a good level of detail and suddenly, your main focus is that program instead of the you program.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105813">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105813/#Comment_105813" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-31T20:02:50+00:00" title="October 31, 2007  8:02PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My theory of immersion is much like Clinton's. Humans construct and wear masks. We put on our 'work mask' in the morning, come home, put on our 'talk to the kids mask,' visit with close friends and wear our 'friends mask.' Maybe a couple people in our lives know what we look like under the mask. I'm not saying life's a lonely place or anything so dramatic. I'm saying that we construct interfaces for interacting with different people. All the masks are 'me' though.<br/><br/>Role-playing can be like that but more artificial. The character masks aren't 'me,' exactly, but the stuff definitely comes out of me and there's definitely a lot of me in there.

They're totally opinion, to the point of being a shot in the dark.</i><br/><br/><b>Immersion (Catharsis)</b><br/>Players with this goal wish to emotionally engage with the same "hard stuff" that the character does; they wish to feel the hardships of the character.   The enjoyment here actually comes after-the-fact; after engaging with such stuff, the player feels a sense of release sometimes described as "cleansing".  It can be compared to watching and engaging with other tragic media.<br/><br/><b>Immersion (Play)</b><br/>Players with this goal are interested in simply being highly engaged with the whole experience of play.  Losing track of time, generally "being in the groove" or "being in flow" with the gameplay are rough ways of putting it.  Engagement is enjoyable partly because while in it, the player feels proficient with the methods of playing, is getting and giving pleasing amounts of attention, activity, and whatever else it is that they also want from the game.<br/><br/><b>Immersion (Kairosis)</b><br/>Players looking for kairosis want to identify with their characters emotionally and personally at the moments of intense change or revelation.  The payoff here is in the actual stirring of emotions in the player because of the intensity of the emotional content attached to the character.  This differs from catharsis in that the result may or may not have specifically pleasing after-play; the reward is the emotional rush on the spot.<br/><br/><b>Immersion (Limited Kairosis)</b><br/>Some players want the emotional rush of Kairosis, but have a specific range of preferred emotions - often, specifically positive emotions.  A player that engages with their character most intensely when that character is about to obtain some form of victory, or when the character is speaking boldly, might be seeking a limited form of Kairosis.<br/><br/><b>Immersion (Kenosis)</b><br/>Kenosis-seeking players wish to simply "let go", abandoning specific goals and concerns as a player, and let the game carry them, acting naturally within the game.  While this appears and is externally identical to engagement, the desired <i>internal, personal payoff</i> is the difference; the player isn't looking to 'be fully on', but to 'simply let go'.  It's possible that the two are actually different degrees of the same thing, but I honestly don't have a damn clue about that.<br/> <br/><b>Immerision (Fiction)</b><br/>Players that want situational immersion are deeply engaged with the fiction of the game.  They may or may not be deeply engaged with their character, and are not necessarily engaged by the various activities and mechanics of play; they are "in the story" in the way that a moviegoer might be swept away by the fiction of a film.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105837/#Comment_105837" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-01T01:49:03+00:00" title="November  1, 2007  1:49AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt_Snyder</cite>I think immersion is a set of techniqes</blockquote>\nErr...

Some have found this definition useful, but others have not. So "Immersion in setting" means you can introduce setting elements without hesitation or contemplation; "Immersion in system" means you can roll the dice and manipulate the mechanics  reflexively; "Immersion in character" means you can speak for and act out the behavior of the character completely automatically - "think as the character."<br/></blockquote>\nI think this is an excessively burdensome definition that often leads to strawman, "That's impossible!" arguments. After all, people don't apply this burden to acting by saying that the Method must be reflexive. Quite the opposite; attempts to jump to reflexive emotional states *as* the character are often discouraged.<br/><br/>I've read Johnstone's discussion of masks/the mask state and in my opinion, it's pretty much the opposite of immersion, because it strikes me as a New Agey way to enable bad acting. (Read through Stanislavsky, the type of bad acting is pretty apparent -- it's the kind of pre-Method "just be the character" indulgence that ends up being artificial and selfish from a performance perspective.) This doesn't apply to the cultural rituals that mask material discusses, but since few of the people doing masked Improv have been shaped in the long term by a culture with those rituals, that doesn't matter much. For the most part archetypal techniques (which masking is a vague subset of) are, IMO, really about narrative, not character. For instance when you look at commedia del arte you quickly realize these characters are the set of guys that cause a basic pattern of things to happen. As characters, they're actually quite feeble, though they do lend themselves to personal projection about the Real Meaning of Columbine, etc. But to my mind, that isn't immersion -- it's just disinhibition.<br/><br/>The last time I gave this a lot of thought I produced two posts on the subject:<br/><br/><a href="http://shootingdice.blogspot.com/2006/03/immersion-and-method.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://shootingdice.blogspot.com/2006/03/immersion-and-method.html</a><br/><br/>Discussion about the technical issues around reflexive response can be found here:<br/><br/><a href="http://shootingdice.blogspot.com/2006/03/immersion-fu.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://shootingdice.blogspot.com/2006/03/immersion-fu.html</a><br/><br/>The discussion of immersion has advanced quite a bit since then (when there was a more strident attempt to discredit the whole style), but I think the essentials still hold true. Strident immersionists and non-immersionists need to get past strawman-perfect immersion and examine it in terms of technique.<br/><br/>These days, I think the two pillars of immersive play -- the "next level" -- have to do with examining the role of power and inequality at the table, not for the sake of rejecting it, but using it wisely, because the great challenges of the form are not so much in feeling/being, but exploring the tension between that and the play world, generating narrative (used here, as always, in its real sense, not as "address-premise") from that key interaction -- and accepting the risks that come with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105845">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt" title="Matt"><img alt="Matt" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/6464691/920923"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt">Matt</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105845/#Comment_105845" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-01T03:21:37+00:00" title="November  1, 2007  3:21AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think part of the problem with immersion is that lots of people claim it as a be-all, while simultaneously using it for different things. This is why I continue to hold it as a set of techniques. A hardcore political LARP that uses immersion is a completely different beast from a freeform character drama that uses it, both use immersion but for entirely different purposes.<br/><br/>One interesting, and paradoxical, thing is that the more you try to immerse in a game that doesn't assist it, the better you get at it. One thing I thank my brief spell in the Camarilla for is teaching me to "tune out" elements that interfered with immersion. Yeah there's some guy over there arguing a rules call, but I'm quite involved with this bit of the scene over here. Similarly the ability to drop in and out of that kind of "flow" is something you can learn from such games. I think for a lot of people when they first get hit by a moment that hinders immersion, their default reaction is to try and remove that kind of moment so it doesn't happen again, whereas learning to filter stuff is a very useful skill.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105848">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Temple" title="Temple"><img alt="Temple" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b340/kreutzer/ubt.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Temple">Temple</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105848/#Comment_105848" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-01T03:56:10+00:00" title="November  1, 2007  3:56AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Immersion is a weird concept. As people in this thread have touched upon,its a vague term that means different thing to different people; something that makes it hard to define, hard to pin down and very hard to discuss in a meaningful way.<br/><br/>For me, the experience of being imersed is a lot like being absorbed by a movie or a book, and it also reminds me very much of experiences Ive had as a stage actor; Its a sense of closely experiening what goes on in the fiction. <br/>Ive heard other people talk about merging with their character, of forgetting who they are for a short while. I dont experience it wuite like that, but I can certainly relate to it. <br/>My friend Ole Peder talks about "killing the observer," that perfect moment when you step fully into your character and forget that you are observing yourself act, on a meta level. Ive never experienced that but I have my own experiences with immersion.<br/>Strangely, most of them come not from roleplaying, but from (as I mentioned previously) watching good movies or reading good books. I am a GM most of the time, and because that requires a certain degree of meta-thinking I cannot afford myself the luxury of immersing during play. But the immersive experiences Ive had almost perfectly match the feeling I get when Im completely absorbed in a novel or a film. <br/>As I mentioned, its also a lot like being really into character on stage. Ive been a stage actor for roughly eight years (though I gave it up when I had kids) and I have  an education in drama. There is always (IME) a sense of loosing yourself to the character when you are on stage, and that feeling bears a distinct resemblance to immersion in roleplaying for me.<br/><br/>Now on to things that break immersion for me. In <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3144&amp;page=1#Item_27" rel="nofollow">this thread</a>, Matthijs describes the "cognitive leap" that is neccessary for him in order to shift from "character mode" into "resource management mode;" an observation that matches my own experiences fairly well.<br/>Its been pointed out numerous times on countless fora how certain systems seem to get in the way of immersion, while others "slip into the background" and dont disturb the immersing player as much.<br/><br/>To me, this is caused by a cognitive leap between meta-levels. If I am forced to "shift my perception" up one level, in the meta-perspective, that instantly breaks my immersion. <br/>Which can be confusing, because some things which require meta-thinking I can do without disturbing my immersion (like improvising a prop on the spot, for example). But the moment I have to consider the games rules and resources, and how they impact the SIS on a meta-level, the immersion is broken for me.<br/><br/>These are just personal observations, and Im not sure if they go anywhere in particular, or if theyre helpful.<br/><br/>One thing I find fascinating is how unimportant immersion seems to be to the indie game designers of this community. On one hand, immersion is a fairly common thing to want out of a game.I see it mentioned all the time on online fora, and all roleplayers I know want to be immersed and strive for it. And yet on the other the theory community (broad, sweeping generalisations are my specialty!) seem to want to minimize the importance of immersion, and design games that are practically antithetical to it (atleast as I know it; as I mentioned, its a vage concept thats hard to discuss in a meaningful manner).<br/><br/>Again, just an observation, nothing more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105849/#Comment_105849" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-01T04:00:53+00:00" title="November  1, 2007  4:00AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As Skjalg is hinting at... discussing immersion on Story Games is bound to get some "I can immerse fine even when thinking about complex systems"-type answers.

The more I have to fiddle (here we go again)with the mechanics, the more energy I have to invest into interpretation and resource management, and the more the mechanical interaction with the system pulls me to the meta-plane, the less capable I am of maintaining immersion.<br/><br/>In lots of indie/story games Ive read and/or played I have observed what I would call "burst immersion." That is, short bursts of immersion, followed by periods of meta-communication about the mechanics and resources, beofre diving into an immersive state again to continue playing. The chief example of this for me was when I played Shock, where the mechanics really interfered with my immersion.<br/><br/>I try to facilitate immersion in my designs, to various degrees. In Downtown Ive purposefully moved all meta-communication to its own phase of play, between scenes, to disturb immersion as little as possible.<br/><br/>Itras City (Itras By, the unpublished norwegian indie game of local fame, which IMO has sort of become a nexus around which norwegian indie design revolve, along with Until We Sink) facilitates immersion extremely well, by eliminating resource management alltogether. The game has no currency or resources of any kind. Until We Sink is another good example, as is Call of Cthulhu with its simple roll-under mechanic and GM-tracked skill progression.<br/><br/>For me, the fewer points of contact, the better the game is at facilitating immersion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105858">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jbuchert" title="jbuchert"><img alt="jbuchert" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jbuchert">jbuchert</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105858/#Comment_105858" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-01T05:43:24+00:00" title="November  1, 2007  5:43AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 1, 2007 5:44AM by jbuchert.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As I started thinking, I thought immersion would naturally split into two primary types, where one was character-based and related to the idea of channeling and the other was in relation to the fiction, the story or the events. The more I think about the latter though, I tend to see it as "just" imagination at work and not necessarily immersion as it's usually meant. It feels like there is some kind of relationship between these, though. Whether they tap into the same areas of the brain, start similar processes in there or if one is the precursor to the next, I'm not feeling qualified to say right now.<br/><br/>When I'm immersed in my character, I don't have to fake the emotions and feelings that the character is supposedly having. They just come to me. The same happens with imaginative components of the fiction: I see the scenes more clearly and as having more powerful imagery. I wouldn't necessarily say I become the character in any way, but that I can tap into the character almost at will. I don't necessarily have to actively reason what, how and why she does things, so it is probably a sign of the activation of some subconscious states. It's definitely related to the concept of <i>flow</i>. I would say immersion is indeed a state of mind (but which can be used as a tool or which can be a goal in itself).<br/><br/>A lot of activity on the meta-level can be harmful to immersion, in as much as it gets in the way of getting things done and advancing play, but I think it is more about being invested in the situation. That can happen even with some meta-discussion, because sometimes I can explain things "out of my immersion", without breaking it.<br/><br/>I see immersion as an important component of most successful play. Play can be enjoyable without it, but the truly great characters, whom I can still remember (and feel) to this day, have always had great moments of immersion. It is very much the elixir I bring back from the visionquest and has this aspect of alchemy to it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Temple" title="Temple"><img alt="Temple" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b340/kreutzer/ubt.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Temple">Temple</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105860/#Comment_105860" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-01T05:48:44+00:00" title="November  1, 2007  5:48AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An additional example that just struck me: Bliss Stage facilitates immersion beautifully, by placing its point of interaction at the very end of the scene.

Both are thrown into something they don't understand, and kept in the dark by the authorities (for the players, that means the GM). Player knowledge = character knowledge.<br/>- The system focuses on a rising physical sensation (heartbeats), which affects players in two ways - consciously or unconsciously: 1. As tension rises, they know their characters' heart rate is quickening, which most probably affects their own bodies slightly. 2. Keeping count in the fiction is something that keeps part of your attention bound to the fiction - "when's the next number coming around"?<br/>- Playing through the dropping down through levels (green, blue) has a mental effect akin to that of a hypnotic countdown - "you feel yourself going to a deeper level..."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105868">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Temple" title="Temple"><img alt="Temple" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b340/kreutzer/ubt.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Temple">Temple</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105868/#Comment_105868" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-01T05:57:51+00:00" title="November  1, 2007  5:57AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jbuchert</cite> [snip]It feels like there is some kind of relationship between these, though. <br/><br/>[snip]I would say immersion is indeed a state of mind (but which can be used as a tool or which can be a goal in itself).<br/><br/>A lot of activity on the meta-level can be harmful to immersion, in as much as it gets in the way of getting things done and advancing play, but I think it is more about being invested in the situation.

Once I sit down in my seat, the credits are done and the movie starts, I gradually slip into a sort of altered state, where Im not really aware of sitting in a movie theatre watching a movie. The seat, the darkness, the people around me, it just doesnt register, because Im so preoccupied with watching the movie that all the other stuff just fades.<br/>The absolutely worst thing that can happen while Im watching a movie in a theater like that (ok, so firebombs and killer ants are technically worse, but you get the idea) is if somethign calls my attention to the fact that Im sitting in a seat in a movie theater, watching a movie with a bunch of other people. It kills the whole thing dead, and Im suddenly ripped out of the story I was in and reduced to just a guy at a cinema, sitting in a seat filled with pop-corn and soda-stains. The magic is gone.<br/><br/>For me,immersin in roleplaying games is just like that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105884">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clyde%20L.%20Rhoer" title="Clyde L.

Here's how I see it breaking down from my own experiences. I experience immersion in Actor stance, and Author Stance. Not Director. I know after defining these <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.theoryfromthecloset.com/shows/tftc_show003.mp3" rel="nofollow">on my show</a>, Jon Kim wrote about immersion in Director stance, (not that these two events are related) and I don't "get" what he's saying, so this is not a claim of be all end all. I have personally experienced these types of immersion. I posit three types of immersion, lets call them forms... anyway I place two forms under Actor Stance, and one form under Author Stance.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>In Actor Stance:</b><br/>\n<br/>\nClassical Actor is where the player responds as the character personality they have built, but there is still some sense of self. The player understands they are portraying a character. Kind of like a classical actor. *grins*<br/>\n<br/>\nMethod Actor is when a player is channeling and becoming the character, sense of self can be very small or even disappear for periods. The player is not as much portraying a character as being the character.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>In Author Stance:</b><br/>\n<br/>\nEgo Immersion is where the player has put their personality into the game, and responds as if they are there. The character is a thin film for them to engage the story like they are there. Sometimes they respond like they imagine they actually would in a situation and sometimes they respond as an idealized self.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also think there's two ways to focus for immersion; at the camera level, or at the character's eyeballs, and these focuses might or might not switch for an individual during play.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think immersionist players are what tends to make up the player base of functional "story before" groups, as I think many immersionists are less worried about story control, and more worried about responding to scenes and challenge as character, or in the case of Ego, as self. I know that I've always felt different as GM than a player. As a GM I enjoyed having control over the story, in a way I never would have liked as a player. I also think that immersionist players tend to have difficulty with story-games due to the need to switch through the various stances. I think for most people holding to a single stance helps to hold onto immersion. I'm aware that some folks don't have the difficulty I do with staying immersed in story-games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marco" title="Marco"><img alt="Marco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marco">Marco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105930/#Comment_105930" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-01T09:36:20+00:00" title="November  1, 2007  9:36AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe I'm the only guy here who finds "Immersion" straight forward. I see all the definitions and shrug. It's like the "What's an RPG?" question: the only thing discussing it helps is the guys who want to exclude something from being an RPG. <br><br><b>Definition</b>: I like the aligning of emotional states. That more or less works for me in a fuzzy kind of way. Suspension of Disbelief and all that. Being "in the game." If you need a discrete definition, I think you're missing the point.<br><br><b>Observation</b>: What I see in the Immersion discussion is a huge amount of theory-driven bullshit making mountains out of molehills.<br><br><b>Examples</b><br>1. "Story Games are BAD For Immersion" Oh, heavens--trash talking story games! I've seen post on The Forge suggesting (incredibly) that Suspension of Disbelief <i>does not exist</i> (can't find the link now though). Whatever "getting into character" is, for a lot of people, certain mechanics or approaches damage the experience. A lot of those things are adopted as best-practices by a lot of Story Games. Specifics don't matter. If you "immerse" just fine playing a Story Game, that's great. The idea that there is One True Immersion and some mechanic breaks it is bullshit. This is only an issue if we're in a circle-the-wagons and defend Story Games mentality ... which, itself, would be the problem.<br><br>2. Immersion as a top-level-goal. Wait, what happened to GNS-Simulationism ... wasn't <i>that</i> Immersive? Oh, what? It wasn't? Wait--I got it! <i>Actor Stance</i>? Yeah? But that's not a goal of or agenda-for play. GNS and Immersion while not defacto incompatible are highly confused because attempting to analyze play (which, IMO / IME, always says more about the analyst than anything else) is an art, not a science. Immersion being both pretty darn internal and a lot of people's <i>reason for playing</i> means that the theory <i>as commonly applied</i> produces strange results (people loving GURPS and playing games with weighty, non-GM-driven premise-style themes).<br><br>3. Trash Talking Immersion. It's immature, selfish, dysfunction, a <i>lie</i>, or a sign of mental illness. Because playing-my-character is both conducive to Immersion (and therefore a top-level goal) and (it is commonly, but falsely believed) destructive to the creation of polished narratives it becomes both a poor excuse and straw-man for attacking bad behavior at the gaming table. A really deep immersive guy may <i>resent</i> coming up with a Kicker for Sorcerer. And he's right to. So it's not the game for him. But even if that ever happened, it's be <i>irrelevant</i> to Immersion as a <i>cause</i> of dysfunction any more than <i>dice pools</i> are.<br><br>-Marco                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105933">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Temple" title="Temple"><img alt="Temple" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b340/kreutzer/ubt.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Temple">Temple</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105933/#Comment_105933" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-01T09:42:30+00:00" title="November  1, 2007  9:42AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think youre spot on in all your points Marco, but I dont agree with the first part of your post.

I don't make that statement to be snarky, just to point out that it's clouding your message, for me at least. Never-tha-less I want to take on number two as it seems aimed at my post. You are right that the stances are not part of creative agenda. Creative agenda is about looking at what's observable in the behavior of groups where everything is running on all cylinders. The focus on play is here because behavior is observable. Inner motivations are not easily observable. Immersion as a state is also not easily observable. Thus the focus of the big model is on looking at the group for motivation because we can analyze behavior, whereas individual motivation requires reporting and it can be hard to verify.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the big model the stances are a place where the focus is on the individual. Also if you look at how folks who immersion is more of the point of playing... they distinguish between in character knowledge and out of character knowledge. Many of my friends and I used to look down our nose on people who didn't play from an immersive point of view, specifically a point of view where the main goal is being true to character. Introducing elements into the fiction, or the shared imaginary space, based on out of character knowledge, or ones personal desires for story is frowned on. The more you are able to engage in the schizoid-ness of separating these two kinds of knowledge, character and non-character, or nonself and self, and introduce elements based on the characters knowledge only, the more you would be considered engaging in good roleplaying. In this kind of play Author stance and Director stance is held to be only tools for the GM.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaking decisions based on out of character knowledge, or personal desires is basically the same thing as Author stance. Therefore when looking at the big model and immersion I place the character based immersion under Actor stance, and the desire based immersion under Author.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_106106">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106106/#Comment_106106" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-01T14:31:51+00:00" title="November  1, 2007  2:31PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Guys, Big Model discussion isn't helping me understand.

You can have actor stance without immersion, I'm not so sure you can have the forms I identified outside of actor stance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_106133">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106133/#Comment_106133" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-01T15:57:57+00:00" title="November  1, 2007  3:57PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like Clinton's explanation.  <br><br>I think Immersion is difficult to talk about because it's sort of adverbial term.

The subjective experience of trying to reflexively play a complex character, "think in character," is more enjoyable/transcendent/etc., even if other mixed techniques might yield better character portrayals from an outside perspective.<br/><br/>So I'm solidly in the end-in-and-of-itself camp. Anything that I can do with deep in-character immersion I can do better with some other technique... except of course have the experience of deep in-character immersion itself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_106225">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander" title="Rob_Alexander"><img alt="Rob_Alexander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/638/nM7WEDAVEW1RY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander">Rob_Alexander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106225/#Comment_106225" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-02T09:18:05+00:00" title="November  2, 2007  9:18AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DannyK</cite><br/>I think Immersion is difficult to talk about because it's sort of adverbial term.

There's one D&amp;D session I GM'd that sticks in my mind - an incredibly engaged, focussed experience for three or four hours (<a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=17657.msg186676#msg186676" rel="nofollow">AP account is here</a>, although it's mostly tangential). It was a brilliant experience - I wouldn't quite say "a high point of my life" but in terms duration and intensity of pleasure it wasn't far off that.<br/><br/>I *want* to call this 'immersion', and in everyday language I'd say I was immersed, but it's clear that this has little (nothing?) do with the character-immersion that has been talked about in this thread (and is the avowed aim of the "hard-core immersionists" mentioned by Mo in her blog). <br/><br/>In that D&amp;D game, I was the GM - I was describing scenes, making rules calls, and planning enemy tactics - but at no point (of the intense, focussed bit) was I roleplaying a character at all. Throughout, I was highly involved at the rules level, and fairly conscious of the the meta-level and the social context (e.g. "Can I really ice the whole party? At what point do I fudge to prevent that?")<br/><br/>If I call that D&amp;D experience 'immersion' in a roleplaying context, I'll sew a lot of confusion. "engagement" and "flow" would be or much better terms, since they don't have so many loaded meanings. My experience was *exactly* the 'flow' that Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi has written about.<br/><br/>(Pre-emptive edit: just read Matthias' article, and apart from the example I'm largely repeating what he said)<br/><br/>I'll add one thing - I can't relate to the various descriptions of character-immersion at all. Certainly not as an intense, pleasurable activity, but not as an unpleasant one either - it's just not something that I've ever registered as happening. It may be worth noting that I have a massive preference for the traditional GM role - it's a rare game that I get much out of as a player. As a player, there's just not enough for me to do to keep me in flow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_106247">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106247/#Comment_106247" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-02T10:48:04+00:00" title="November  2, 2007 10:48AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Immersion, dictionary.<br/><br/>Denotation: Intense absorbtion into a topic with neglect to other duties or potential distractions.<br/>Connotation: As <i>concentration</i>, with spiritual overtones.<br/><br/>Example of immersion: Character discussion of the imagined space which elevates that imagined space from ephemeral to the consistent and quasi-real. Example: Victor has a moral dilemna with a planned assassination; Victor's player begins to understand that moral dilemna despite having no qualms with it in reality. Victor's player stands up from the table and makes an impassioned speech <i>as Victor</i> in regards to the issue, perhaps punching a wall, being moved to tears, or otherwise genuinely expressing an emotion wholly owned by the character, not by the player.<br/><br/>Example of non-immersion: "Fuck yeah, critical hit! Get back in here John, critical hit! Everybody take a shot!"<br/><br/>The previous two examples are, perhaps, my favorite showcases of comradery in roleplaying, and life in general.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_106260">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106260/#Comment_106260" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-02T11:12:30+00:00" title="November  2, 2007 11:12AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've only seen one definition of immersion that encompassed what I've seen described that way; it was Mendel's.  To paraquote him, immersion is narrowing of views.  And a view (to him) is basically all the parts of a game you can see that happens during a game session, including things like talking, gesturing, the mechanics, characters, the story and so forth.  (Maybe I'm expanding that definition a bit, but it suits this purpose.)  So wherever you focus (i.e. narrow your view) on one thing, you become immersed in that thing.  It has some non-intuitive consequences, like suggesting that you can be immersed in mechanics.  This starts to make sense when you consider the way some people play D&amp;D: anything that isn't dice rolling is considered silly and unnecessary.  And other groups only care about cool things happening - a good story - but don't particularly care about the characters.  They want to immerse in the story.  And other groups want to stay deep in character.  And still other groups want to socialize.  Under this view of immersion, doing anything to the exclusion of everything else qualifies.<br/><br/>The primary objection to this view that I've seen is that it includes lots of things that aren't character immersion.  And I see the problem (losing specificity), because then you can't say "immersion" and mean "being my character" (or something similar.)  I propose a simple solution: add some additional qualifiers.  "Character immersion," for example, or even "emotional character immersion."  The way I'm looking at it, immersion is a big enough tent for us all to coexist under, so long as we put up some signs to help us find our way around the inside.                        </div>\n<div

If you're enjoying narrowing around different aspects of the game, it's going to wreck things.<br/><br/>Often, but not necessarily always.  Assuming the group members have a shared agenda about what's important to focus on, it shouldn't wreck the game.  (EDITED: You said different - I missed that word.  I agree.) But this is unfortunately rarely the case.  In this regard, many "indie" or "story" games are highly successful, in that they encourage a group to focus on one part of the game together, not as a matter of preference, but as part of following the rules/structure of the game.  This might also explain why some games simply fail for some groups: they're used to focusing on something other than what the game encourages, and import this into a game that doesn't support their desired focus.  In a sense, they're trying to immerse in something a particular game doesn't provide.  It's like sitting in a tub with an inch of water in it and wondering why you can't get fully submerged.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_106332">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hoog" title="hoog"><img alt="hoog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hoog">hoog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106332/#Comment_106332" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-02T14:17:41+00:00" title="November  2, 2007  2:17PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            how about this one:<br/><br/>immersion is tricking ourselves into believing that what's going on in the game is, to a certain degree, real                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_106339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106339/#Comment_106339" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-02T14:42:28+00:00" title="November  2, 2007  2:42PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rob Alexander</cite><cite>Posted By: DannyK</cite><br/>I think Immersion is difficult to talk about because it's sort of adverbial term.

There's one D&amp;D session I GM'd that sticks in my mind - an incredibly engaged, focussed experience for three or four hours (<a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=17657.msg186676#msg186676" rel="nofollow">AP account is here</a>, although it's mostly tangential). It was a brilliant experience - I wouldn't quite say "a high point of my life" but in terms duration and intensity of pleasure it wasn't far off that.<br/><br/>I *want* to call this 'immersion', and in everyday language I'd say I was immersed, but it's clear that this has little (nothing?) do with the character-immersion that has been talked about in this thread (and is the avowed aim of the "hard-core immersionists" mentioned by Mo in her blog).<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rob, you're right.  Flow != Immersion.  <br/><br/>I like flow, in gaming and out.<br/>Immersion, not so much.  I've really gotten into a character's head before to the point of dreaming about him, but he's still  a little fictional robot construct living a pseudo-life somewhere in the darkness inside my head.  I think that disqualifies me from participation in the thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_106352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106352/#Comment_106352" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-02T16:26:50+00:00" title="November  2, 2007  4:26PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Again, thanks very much to everyone who is offering insight and suggestions.

I've enjoyed immersion more often as a player because I have less big picture stuff to deal with, but as a GM I've also been able to have scenes where I dive into an NPC and we're (players and I) in the scene together.<br/><br/>I agree with previous comments that immersion is something you strive for but don't always achieve.  I use tools like accents, gestures, body language, character backgrounds, relationship maps, character drawings, setting research, music, props and anything I think would help me to immerse.  Often, I'm just talking with a silly voice and holding a wine glass with my pinky up looking like a goof.  But there are those moments when the real world slips away and the picture of this other place and this other story takes over.  All the silly is worth it for those fleeting minutes.  Not only for those minutes, really, but the ability to retell those moments to others and to strive for them again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_106687">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cydmab" title="cydmab"><img alt="cydmab" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cydmab">cydmab</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106687/#Comment_106687" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-05T07:17:42+00:00" title="November  5, 2007  7:17AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite>This may be a tangent, but I think it's worth putting out there.

Per my definition/axiom of immersion, by definition having to work through consciously a paradox is a break (even if temporary) in immersion. One classic case of this is some types of personality mechanics where I intuitively decide my character will do x, but then someone else invokes a personality mechanic requiring the character to do y.<br/><br/>However, another example for me would be setting immersion. If someone says "you enter a bar," I immediately begin fleshing out details of the bar in my own mind. What it smells like, who is there, what kind of furniture is present, etc. If I imagine there is a fireplace there, and then later learn from someone else with authority that there is no fireplace present, it'll cause a hiccup.<br/><br/>There are a couple ways to minimize the chance of these hiccups. One is to operate with as thin a conception of setting (or character) as possible.  With a thin setting, it becomes feasible to communicate every detail into the shared imagined space, and there is less chance of conflict over details if there are no details at all. But this is less satisfying if the whole point of the exercise is to explore the setting or character.<br/><br/>Another solution is "don't ask, don't tell" - we each flesh out the details of the setting (character) in our own way, and try not to waste too much time communicating those facts to others. In other words, allow the individual imagined spaces to differ from the shared imagined space. If we do have to communicate something, try to make the details additive and not prohibitive (add a fireplace, but don't try to assert the non-existence of one).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_106691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106691/#Comment_106691" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-05T07:49:12+00:00" title="November  5, 2007  7:49AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The concept of the immersion hiccup has just entered my vocabulary.

We had a fascinating incident where the GM and the players had an entire scene that took place in two different locations - as a player I thought it was a a little odd, but we were used to rolling with things, and it only emerged later that the bar the players were shooting up wasn't the bar that the GM set the scene in.  Both had been established earlier.  This might be a peril of having a very light gloss over setting details, that willingness to agree rather than question or object.  Anyway, it certainly caused a hiccup in our interaction with the setting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_106695">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cydmab" title="cydmab"><img alt="cydmab" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cydmab">cydmab</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106695/#Comment_106695" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-05T08:22:24+00:00" title="November  5, 2007  8:22AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, the reason I use the term is that, from reading about and thinking on immersions compatability with story games, its not so much that immersion is impossible with story games, is that some story games (and traditional GMing) require regular and common breaks from total-stream-of-consciousness play. So even after extensive practice, there will be "hiccups" - practice can reduce the hiccups to literally one-second or less of conscious thought, but if you have to break immersion once a minute for a second each it puts an upper bound on how deep immersion can go. It's still entirely fair and reasonable to say "I immersed while playing story game xx" but even with tremendous practice there's only so deep a state you can go when doing that.<br/><br/>In other words, it helps (at least for some people) to try to keep the time between hiccups as long as possible. In a LARP you might aim for hours or even days to achieve very deep levels of immersion. In a table top setting, half an hour between hiccups is still preferable to a few minutes.<br/><br/>One technique that some have suggested elsewhere is to make full use of scene-breaks. During the scene break, do all your director-stance and/or typically-incompatible-with-immersion stuff: edit characters, change characters, change scene, discuss administrative concerns, discuss the last scene's themes, discuss what the next theme should be about, talk about the local sports team, etc. Maybe resolve the conflict for the next scene with a fortune-at-the-beginning mechanic  (This is something I'd like to experiment with more). Make heavy use of the scene breaks, so you don't have to do that stuff during the scenes.<br/><br/>I've been partly implementing this technique in Polaris, in the sense of making sure to make full use of between-scene time to discuss themes, setting, direction of the story, etc. out of the way. Then practice with making scenes longer and longer.<br/><br/>This is all related to the observation that in many immersion-focussed traditional games, the players will do extensive setting work and talk to the GM about themes and stories and such BETWEEN SESSIONS, and then religiously avoid anything vaguely related to director stance during play. So maybe a compromise system with long scenes and long scene breaks could work as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_106701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ross" title="ross"><img alt="ross" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://pics.livejournal.com/ross_winn/pic/0000syzd"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ross">ross</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106701/#Comment_106701" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-05T08:41:58+00:00" title="November  5, 2007  8:41AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have always felt the pressure of immersive gamers to be antithetical to teaching new players.

I'm normally not so very solipsistic, but the really mind-blowing elements of this thread and threads like it over at rpg.net are:<br/><br/>1) The fact that there's so much spread in what people actually mean when they use the word "immersion." For me it's always, always been the tricking-yourself-into-believing-game-events-are-real mindset. This has been <i>the very definition of roleplaying </i>(as an activity) for me and everyone I know who plays for, shoot...26 years now.<br/><br/>2) The apparent interchangeability of "immersion" and "being engaged with the game" in many people's vocabularies. First noticed this with, of all people, Luke Crane. It took several weeks of talking past each other to get that, when he says he strives for immersion in his games, he's talking about what I've always thought of as engagement (paying attention to, and caring about, all the moving parts) and not what I've always taken to mean as immersion (pretending so hard that you lose yourself in the moment of play).<br/><br/>3) I get the impression that the play/activity goal of immersion is actively avoided and even <i>feared </i>by blocs of players out there. More than once I've read in a thread something along the lines of, "I find immersion creepy." The mind boggles! That's like saying "I love baseball, but all the running around between the bases freaks me out."<br/><br/>Basically it appears things have progressed in RPing in some really surprising ways that don't make themselves apparent 'til someone stops and says "Wait! What are we talking about again?" Like in this thread. It's really no wonder the culture clash is as great as it is. I mean, I can squeeze pretending-really-hard "immersion" out of nearly any game activity, but many new designs actively interfere with that play goal. I've lost several players who were unwilling to go through the extra work just to play the new hotness I found so exciting.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_106985">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106985/#Comment_106985" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-06T09:40:30+00:00" title="November  6, 2007  9:40AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not helpful, Paul.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>I don't know anything about immersion.

It is being mindful of the other players, the rules, the setup and the like, without having your mind somewhere else, and without being or enabling distractions.<br/><br/>3) Immersion is when you engage so fully in a persona that the line of roleplaying and reality blur. You will have another player roll your dice for you to preserve immersion (if dice are used at all). In a live action environment, you will immerse yourself in the persona of a sports fan by hanging out at a bar and watching sports for hours <i>in character</i>.

I don't get to play much, and when I do I find it unsatisfying in many ways. I wonder if that is, in some part, because my player-immersion muscles aren't as well developed as my GM-immersion muscles.<br/><br/>As a GM, the thing that totally kills my immersion is having to rewind a scene. Fucking hate it. Just came up in a game last Friday, in which we were trying to hack through a tangle of rules. The "original" chain of events was IMO cool and exciting, but it had produced a suboptimal outcome for the player in question. So rather than going with the flow, he insisted we rewind and play things out "correctly." At that moment, he did not care about the immersive part of the experience. For me, GMing, it meant having to sacrifice the story that had already started settling into place in my head.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_107004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107004/#Comment_107004" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-06T10:09:04+00:00" title="November  6, 2007 10:09AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, that is helpful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_107007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Temple" title="Temple"><img alt="Temple" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b340/kreutzer/ubt.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Temple">Temple</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107007/#Comment_107007" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-06T10:16:57+00:00" title="November  6, 2007 10:16AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>1) Immersion is, as Hoog says, tricking yourself into believing that what is happening at the table is at least a little real.<br/><br/>2) Immersion is being engaged with what is happening at the table.

Immersion, as I understand the word, means being totally submerged.  If we take the character to be the liquid in question, immersion would mean being totally submerged in the character.  Being engaged by your character, on the other hand, would merely imply that you are in the water, without describing how much of you is submerged.  And I think this analogy works out pretty well for the way Paul uses these words.  Well done.<br/><br/>Sure, there's no right definition, but even if we take words to be like colors used to paint a picture, there are some colors that make the subject of the painting easier to recognize than others.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_107057">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hoog" title="hoog"><img alt="hoog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hoog">hoog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107057/#Comment_107057" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-06T13:39:48+00:00" title="November  6, 2007  1:39PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Temple</cite><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>1) Immersion is, as Hoog says, tricking yourself into believing that what is happening at the table is at least a little real.<br/><br/>2) Immersion is being engaged with what is happening at the table.

Which is why I really like the beliefs/instincts part of BW, they really give you a great insight into a character's psyche, like a roadmap to the mental space you want.</blockquote>\n(Please forgive the forthcoming jargon)  <br/>The BW stuff you're talking about sounds like Narritivist Immersion, whereas if you're playing <br/><br/>Basic D&amp;D <br/>in a dungeon environment <br/>with levers to pull <br/>and monsters to fight <br/>and collapsing floors <br/>and treasure to grab<br/>and riddles to solve <br/>and factions to play off of each other<br/>and a princess to save<br/>and all of these things are happening at once <br/>in a kind of running battle <br/>slash scavenger hunt <br/>slash party<br/>slash team sport<br/><br/>you get Gamist immersion even without any idea of your character's psyche.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_107155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt" title="Matt"><img alt="Matt" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/6464691/920923"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt">Matt</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107155/#Comment_107155" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-07T06:40:07+00:00" title="November  7, 2007  6:40AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Er, not really, its irrelevant of creative agenda.

It has some non-intuitive consequences, like suggesting that you can be immersed in mechanics.  This starts to make sense when you consider the way some people play D&amp;D: anything that isn't dice rolling is considered silly and unnecessary.  And other groups only care about cool things happening - a good story - but don't particularly care about the characters.  They want to immerse in the story.  And other groups want to stay deep in character.  And still other groups want to socialize.  Under this view of immersion, doing anything to the exclusion of everything else qualifies.</blockquote>This is much like what I was saying earlier.  I find that encouraging, since it means we're thinking along the same sort of lines.

I also dont think that you can draw lines betweenthe various identified forms of immersion and CA.<br/><br/>Mechanics in Nar games can definately interfere with character immersion, and a Nar playstyle often calls for Stances which are incompatible with character immersion (director and author). Im reading Contenders right now, and it would be absolutely impossible for me to immerse in my character in that game.<br/>Likewise, character immersion can happen in Sim games, no problem. Just look at Call of Cthulhu, a game that is most often played in a Sim fashion but supports immersion in character like theres no tomorrow.<br/><br/>Flow and Engagement, as  concepts, fit all playstyles IMO. <br/><br/>In the end, I think immersion is wholly divorced from CA, and all this Big Model speak doesnt really have any business being in this thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_107228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107228/#Comment_107228" name="Item_104" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-07T11:22:58+00:00" title="November  7, 2007 11:22AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Guys, start your own Big Model thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_107242">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107242/#Comment_107242" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-07T12:06:41+00:00" title="November  7, 2007 12:06PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite><br/><br/>F+E and F+I are both pretty common, so much so that they're often conflated.

According to a views model of player functioning, you can immerse in things other than your character.  You could become totally enmeshed in the mechanical aspect of the game to the exclusion of all else.  This sounds a lot like E(ngagement), as used by Temple and others.  Of course, you could also immerse in characters, which sounds like I(mmersion), as it is being used here.<br/><br/>I strongly support classifying immersion broadly and letting specific subareas be denoted by additional adjectives.  It solves the problem of "Your immersion isn't in my immersion" and lets everyone discuss the varieties of immersion without so much apparent conflict.  In this sort of scheme, you'd see "Flow" as equivalent to "Immersion" and use whichever term you like.  We would then talk about things like "character immersion," "mechanical immersion," "story immersion," and so forth.<br/><br/>I know I've brought this up several times in this thread, but I haven't heard any objections yet.  I hope this line of thought isn't, in the immortal words of Wolfgang Pauli, "not even wrong."

Is this strictly on a per-player basis or can one dare state that one of those states is the "best"? This is mostly a thought exercise. My feeling is that "flow" is most desirable but I'm not sure if a flow state arises from being immersed and/or engaged, or if immersion/engagement arise from being in a flow state. Possibly both are true. <br/><br/>Calling all three of these states "Immersion" or whatever seems like a not-useful way to go, pedantically speaking. Feels like a lot of energy being spent on being right and not on exploring the ideas themselves. That said, I appreciate that terminology can frame a discussion. Personally I'm not convinced imagining-really-hard (immersion), invested-in-the-mechanics (engagement), and doing-without-thinking (flow) are all subsets of the same fundamental head space. This is not a dis! Please don't anyone take this personally.<br/><br/>I feel like there's probably a fourth state that describes what has traditionally been the GM's optimal head space. It's sorta-kinda <i>immersion</i> except that GMs aren't "supposed" to be heavily invested in any given character's POV. It's sorta-kinda <i>engagement</i> except that GMs are "supposed" to be the last word on mechanical issues (presumably to preserve/encourage <i>flow</i> for individuals and the group). It's probably closest to <i>flow</i> except what you're doing-without-thinking <i>about</i> is stuff outside a character's POV: What's best for the story? What's the best conflict? What themes or symbols or other story constructs make the most sense at this moment? This is where storygame stuff comes in: It seems to me that these newer games often try to bring players into this GM-optimal state. Not all players may want to be brought into this state,or may find this state unfamiliar/uncomfortable.

I find it jarring as a GM in a very different way than when I'm a player. Yeah, it's fucking up my flow, but it's also interfering with my visualization of events (sort of immersion-y) for reasons that have nothing to do with my investment in mechanical systems and outcomes (sort of engagement-y). This happened in a game of mine very recently, so I've been thinking a lot about how my visualization as a GM is different than my visualization as a player. <br/><br/>I've also noticed on several occasions that certain recent games play way, way better with experienced GMs around the table than when it's a bunch of players and one GM. <i>Burning Empires</i> is a great example: Played by a bunch of GMs who are comfortable with lots of story authority and can easily visualize the whole stage? Rocks. Played by a bunch of trad players with no experience with story authority and cannot easily visualize anything outside their characters?

My use of "flow" refers to the state of doing things without thinking through them. It's kind of a neutral state because you can be in a flow state while immersed (e.g. I describe what my character is doing and how he's feeling because I've totally internalized the character's mindset, values, decision-making processes, etc.). I can also flow while engaged (e.g. everyone knows how to move fluidly through the mechanics, nobody's looking anything up, everyone's working the system to their advantage).<br/><br/>That said, "flow" to me -- and maybe only me! -- is a highest-and-best achievement of any given internal state. I can immerse without flow, but it's harder. I'm trying really hard to imagine myself as my character, but other considerations keep bringing me out of that state. I can also be engaged without flow, which is where everyone really cares about mechanical outcomes and processes but we're constantly looking stuff up and discussing/arguing rules interpretations. You know, those first two or three sessions of most RPGs. :-)<br/><br/>So, as a GM, I can also flow but, like I said, it doesn't feel like immersive flow nor does it feel like engagement flow. I'm not immersed into a character's POV. It's not the rules or the system itself that I'm flowing with. It's this third category of imaginative elements: themes, storylines, twists, big reveals, NPCs, scene framing. All the story-level stuff that's traditionally been the GM's job, and that we sometimes find distributed to the players these days.<br/><br/>I know some of this sounds like director stance, but I think that's putting the cart before the horse. Rather than focusing my energies on managing stage-level imaginative elements, those stage-level imaginative elements are freely flowing (!) out of me.

My use of "flow" refers to the state of doing things without thinking through them. It's kind of a neutral state because you can be in a flow state while immersed (e.g. I describe what my character is doing and how he's feeling because I've totally internalized the character's mindset, values, decision-making processes, etc.). I can also flow while engaged (e.g. everyone knows how to move fluidly through the mechanics, nobody's looking anything up, everyone's working the system to their advantage).<br/><br/>That said, "flow" to me -- and maybe only me! -- is a highest-and-best achievement of any given internal state. I can immerse without flow, but it's harder. I'm trying really hard to imagine myself as my character, but other considerations keep bringing me out of that state. I can also be engaged without flow, which is where everyone really cares about mechanical outcomes and processes but we're constantly looking stuff up and discussing/arguing rules interpretations. You know, those first two or three sessions of most RPGs. :-)<br/><br/>So, as a GM, I can also flow but, like I said, it doesn't feel like immersive flow nor does it feel like engagement flow. I'm not immersed into a character's POV. It's not the rules or the system itself that I'm flowing with. It's this third category of imaginative elements: themes, storylines, twists, big reveals, NPCs, scene framing. All the story-level stuff that's traditionally been the GM's job, and that we sometimes find distributed to the players these days.<br/><br/>I know some of this sounds like director stance, but I think that's putting the cart before the horse. Rather than focusing my energies on managing stage-level imaginative elements, those stage-level imaginative elements are freely flowing (!) out of me. It may be a distinction without a difference, and possibly a distraction in this conversation. But I feel like stances are a statement of your intent (I am going to focus on acting out my part, or directing the world, or whatever), while this discussion is a description of various internal states. Maybe you achieve those states via stances, maybe not.<br/><br/>p.<br/><br/>I think this has to do with your interpretation of the concept of Flow. For me, Flow <i>is</i> that state your referring to where you are so deep in the experience you dont think about it.<br/>I dont think that dividing Flow into "immersive flow" and "engagement flow" is a good idea. Flow is Flow, and while Immersion and Engagement are certainly a part of Flow, Flow can exist without Immersion or Engagement (not that Im still using Immersion to mean character immersion and Engagement to mean system immersion).<br/><br/>So to my mind, what you are describing is still Flow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_107340">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cydmab" title="cydmab"><img alt="cydmab" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cydmab">cydmab</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107340/#Comment_107340" name="Item_120" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-08T05:41:55+00:00" title="November  8, 2007  5:41AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To expand on my model of immersion slightly:<br/><br/>1. "Immersion in x" (x includes character, setting, system, etc.) means being able to reflexively, unconsciously, automatically generate elements of or work with x.<br/><br/>a. Immersion in character means reflexively think and do what the character would think and do<br/>b. Immersion in setting means reflexively generate setting elements and imagine the setting<br/>c. Immersion in system means automatically manipulate system elements.<br/><br/>2. What I will call "total immersion" is when you have immersed in x on everything you are doing, and not consciously reflecting on thinking about anything, (Perhaps this is a form of flow?)<br/><br/>3. What I will call "deep character immersion" is total immersion, plus the ability to "think in character." You can consciously reflect on things, but only from the character's perspective.<br/><br/>(If you think 2 and 3 are "impossible," then think of the definitions as platonic ideals that one can approximate, even if one can not achieve) <br/><br/>So, in terms of whether immersion and engagement are compatible, it depends. Immersion in x is certainly possible. However, total immersion might be impossible/hard depending on what you mean by engagement. By definition, when I'm total immersed or  deep character immersed, I'm not consciously reflecting on what the other players are doing. I might very well be IGNORING some things other players are doing. If engagement means paying attention to everything at the table, then I rarely engage while total immersed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_107345">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Temple" title="Temple"><img alt="Temple" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b340/kreutzer/ubt.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Temple">Temple</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107345/#Comment_107345" name="Item_121" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-08T05:53:57+00:00" title="November  8, 2007  5:53AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I started a post, but then found it was really just a semantic point I was arguing.<br/><br/>We need to get our terminology straight on this issue before we can discuss any further I think.

As people have said before, there's a disconnect between roleplaying and other forms of fiction.  I don't think it serves our purposes to treat roleplaying as a novel or a movie here.  The terms we've got (FIE in this case) are specific to roleplaying in a way that general fiction terms aren't.<br/><br/>Flow is fairly generic I suppose, but engagement is pointing at something specific that roleplaying has that other forms of fiction don't: participation.  Other forms of fiction don't tend to foster immersion as much either, from my own experience and what I've heard people say about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_107380">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Stuart" title="Stuart"><img alt="Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Stuart">Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107380/#Comment_107380" name="Item_130" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-08T08:45:06+00:00" title="November  8, 2007  8:45AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The books talk a lot about roleplaying, LARPs, MUDs, MMORPGs, and interactive fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_107391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107391/#Comment_107391" name="Item_131" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-08T09:20:49+00:00" title="November  8, 2007  9:20AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I didn't realize from the titles.

It might be helpful to understand these concepts from the greater human perspective and then bring it back to gaming. Here is my interpretation of what these things are and how they are different and interrelated.<br/>\n<br/>\nEngagement: Being intellectually invested in what you are doing. This is like the difference between a good lecture and a bad one. If you are engaged, you are paying attention and actively processing what is going. If asked to participate you could give evaluative opinions on what is happening.<br/>\n<br/>\nImmersion: Being emotionally invested in what you are doing. This is like being at a sporting event where you deeply care about the outcome. Your emotional state is an extension of the activity and can be directed back into the activity.<br/>\n<br/>\nFlow: Minimizing the awareness of distractions and routine tasks in the pursuit of an engaging activity. This is like having a great conversation on a long, easy drive where at the end you can remember your conversation, but realize that the driving part was done pretty much on automatic. You can be in Flow all by itself, but it is just zoning out, and that really isn't much fun for most people.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy thinking is that Flow compliments both Engagement and Immersion, but Engagement and Immersion have a more complicated relationship. Engagement and Immersion both require a concentration which can be disturbed, Flow obviously enhances this by reducing the impact of distractions. Engagement and Immersion are both types of mental investment, and while I don't think that they are incompatible, I do think that they are competitive with each other in that each is a distraction to the other. The more you Immerse yourself emotionally, the harder it is to Engage intellectually and vice versa.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that this model is able to accommodate many, if not all, of the concerns raised so far in the thread and can be useful for understanding game design and actual play experiences.<br/>\n<br/>\nThoughts?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_107422">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Temple" title="Temple"><img alt="Temple" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b340/kreutzer/ubt.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Temple">Temple</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107422/#Comment_107422" name="Item_136" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-08T12:53:40+00:00" title="November  8, 2007 12:53PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: mothlos</cite>Thoughts?</blockquote>\nI think you are on to something!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_107427">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/schlafmanko" title="schlafmanko"><img alt="schlafmanko" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/schlafmanko">schlafmanko</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107427/#Comment_107427" name="Item_137" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-08T13:26:45+00:00" title="November  8, 2007  1:26PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Max P</cite>I like the terms, but what do they mean?

So I'm interested in refining and broadening my techniques for becoming immersed.<br/><br/>From this angle, I think it's useful to keep I = (having an intuitive / unconscious grasp of character, setting, story, or rules, ala cydmab) separate from F = (flow, being seamlessly absorbed in the world, story, character, or whatnot), rather than making I a subset of F.  Yes, it's probably an artificial distinction.  What I normally call immersion -- the sense of being in the character and feeling or thinking some of the same things as your character does as events unfold -- is both F and I, and having an intuitive grasp of your character (I) basically means that your character's actions are flowing seamlessly (F). <br/> <br/>But here's what makes distinguishing F and I interesting to me regardless: if I'm trying to get to FI, I can approach it initially either through F or through I.  On one side are techniques for building up a stronger intuitive sense of your character / setting / whatever you're trying to immerse in: e.g. using imagery, symbols, situations, and props that you already have a visceral connection to, picturing things carefully to enhance their emotional bang, etc.  Also, things that help immersion from this perspective don't need to happen at the gaming table -- I suspect that's what's going on with writing things in your character's voice outside of game, talking to your character in a trance outside game, etc.  In these techniques, you get an intuitive grasp of what's going on first, and once you engage that in a game setting, you get flow.  <br/><br/>On the other side are techniques where you cultivate flow and hope to develop an intuitive grasp of character / setting /story / whatever from that.  Csikszentmihalyi has a list of conditions that help enable flow, but IIRC, the biggest factors in <i>Finding Flow</i> are being in a situation that's both highly challenging but within your abilities, and having continuous immediate feedback from the situation.  So if I'm having quick-paced conversations in character about something significant, that fits both conditions well, and when I'm having those conversations, sooner or later I'll stop thinking about what my character should say, say something I didn't expect, and feel like I've jumped into either the character's or the story's head.  <br/><br/>Some techniques work from both the perspective of cultivating flow and cultivating intuitive connection to character.  For example, if I can use the mechanics to make my character do something surprising to me, that's great for initiating immersion for me, though potentially bad for maintaining it.  The reason it works is that it gets me out of the rut of analytically deciding what my character would do based on x belief or y background.  Once the character starts acting independently of me, I often find myself grabbing hold of the character intuitively and from there jumping into her.  But the other thing that goes on when a character acts unexpectedly is that it makes the character more challenging and interesting as a puzzle to interact with, and that facilitates flow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_107429">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Temple" title="Temple"><img alt="Temple" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b340/kreutzer/ubt.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Temple">Temple</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107429/#Comment_107429" name="Item_138" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-08T13:36:21+00:00" title="November  8, 2007  1:36PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For my part, I just want tools.<br/><br/>I want to be able to discuss immersion without causing a huge misunderstanding because nobody knows what the other person means when he says immersion.

I suppose it'd help the discussion though if I said what those techniques were though <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>The first is "stock characters." Take a very simple character, and master it so that it's easy to reflexively, intuitively determine what the character would do. In my terminology, it's an easy character to Immerse in Character with because it's a simple character. Furthermore, being simple, it's easy to handle the character in mental background while handling other stuff consciously. For example, I sometimes use and "character immerse" in stock npcs when doing traditional GMing. I can focus my conscious attention on directing story, dealing with rules calls, making sure everyone is engaged, etc. and portray the simple npc easily and automatically. <br/><br/>The other technique is what I'll call "standard acting," because it's what I do if my number one priority is portraying a character to an audience. I Immerse in Character with a potentially complex character. This generates a stream of reflexive impulses about what the character should do. But simultaneously I also consciously think about what the character would do. At any given moment, I choose whether to go with my "gut" or my "mind" for what the character should do. This method never gets me to Deep Character Immersion, but allows me to take directly into account what the audience expects or what the story requires the character to do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_107725">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cydmab" title="cydmab"><img alt="cydmab" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cydmab">cydmab</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107725/#Comment_107725" name="Item_140" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-10T16:17:42+00:00" title="November 10, 2007  4:17PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: schlafmanko</cite><br/>On the other side are techniques where you cultivate flow and hope to develop an intuitive grasp of character / setting /story / whatever from that.

In my model, one needs to both have a reflexive grasp of the character, AND not be consciously thinking about anything else. That second part is what I think corresponds to flow. So I'll consider methods that might help block out thinking about anything other than character.<br/><br/>The technique you identify should work - a challenging, rapid-fire situation requires more focus on the character, giving less chance to be distracted by non-character related stuff.<br/><br/>Another issue is just not having any other responsibilities. IIRC a previous poster mentioned about that immersion isn't terribly compatible with teaching newbies, and this might be a reason.<br/><br/>Another method is to use an extremely complex/detailed character. Take 5-10 minutes before the game meditating on the all the zillion details and facts of the character. If the character is sufficiently complex, there might not be any leftover mental energy to get distracted by other things.<br/><br/>A complex setting might help, subject to the constraint that one can still Immerse in Setting, in the sense that holding the setting in mind takes a certain amount of mental energy. Energy that can't go into conscious thinking. <br/><br/>Another possibility, albeit counterintuitive, is maybe a complex system can actually increase immersion, subject to the constraint that one can perfectly master the system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_107808">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ross" title="ross"><img alt="ross" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://pics.livejournal.com/ross_winn/pic/0000syzd"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ross">ross</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107808/#Comment_107808" name="Item_141" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-11T13:56:43+00:00" title="November 11, 2007  1:56PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excuse me if I am late to the party, but I have been busy and thinking.<br/><br/>Immersion, much like cinematic, is a word that no one understands. When the word was first used in RPGs some years ago no one bothered to define it. This happens to so many terms used in RPGs. I mention this point in my column on <a href="http://www.rpg.net/columns/edit/edit40.phtml" rel="nofollow">Spirit of the Century</a>, and I have ranted elsewhere. The terms are so confused now that any serious discussion of classification is shat on by every single one of Godwin's children. I will beat this dead horse until I can tilt at this windmill, and I love to be an asshole, so here goes.<br/><br/>Immersion is when the players attempt to wave their privates in the air and fool each other in to thinking that they are not really having out-of-character thoughts, only in-character thoughts.

When the word was first used in RPGs some years ago no one bothered to define it. This happens to so many terms used in RPGs. I mention this point in my column on<a href="http://www.rpg.net/columns/edit/edit40.phtml" rel="nofollow">Spirit of the Century</a>, and I have ranted elsewhere. The terms are so confused now that any serious discussion of classification is shat on by every single one of Godwin's children. I will beat this dead horse until I can tilt at this windmill, and I love to be an asshole, so here goes.<br/><br/>Immersion is when the players attempt to wave their privates in the air and fool each other in to thinking that they are not really having out-of-character thoughts, only in-character thoughts. No matter how ludicrous the situation or ideas presented. This is especially useful if they are unemployed, unable to pass a literacy exam in their native tongue, and incapable of not being repulsive to the opposite sex.

If I'm immersed in a book, at no time do I ever "forget" that I'm reading words and turning pages. If I'm immersed in a movie, I'm still <i>aware</i> that I'm sitting in a movie theater. If I'm immersed in playing a character, I still know that I'm "just" sitting at a table with my friends throwing dice and talking. It's just that I don't have to <i>pay attention</i> to those things, just like in the "real world" I don't have to <i>pay attention</i> to making my body walk around and breathe.<br/><br/>What breaks immersion for me is when the interface demands too much attention. Interestingly, that means that sometimes things can be <i>too good</i> for me to get immersed in. Especially with books, I've read things that were <i>so</i> well written that I kept stopping and noticing how good a particular bit of prose was or how well an exchange of dialog gave insight into the characters' personalities. I couldn't get fully immersed in the fictional experience because the damned interface kept <i>impressing</i> me so much. Doesn't mean I didn't like the book, just that I enjoyed it in a different way than the ones I've been able to become immersed in. Really badly written books interfere with my immersion too, but I seem to be much better at ignoring bad prose than good.<br/><br/>As far as games go, I find familiarity with the system is a big help for me. Rolling dice and adding numbers and pushing tokens around or whatever don't interfere with my immersion at all, as long as I don't have to stop and think about <i>which</i> dice to roll, <i>what</i> numbers to add, and <i>where</i> those tokens are supposed to go. <br/><br/>Once I know the system well enough, another thing that's a <i>huge</i> help to me is a <i>consistent level of interaction with the game mechanics</i>. It doesn't matter at all how simple or complex the mechanics are; if I'm constantly using dice and fiddly bits throughout the session I quickly stop noticing them. It's games where you <i>don't</i> use any mechanics for a long time and then abruptly have to stop and switch into dice-rolling mode that really kick me out of immersion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_107906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107906/#Comment_107906" name="Item_144" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-12T08:10:32+00:00" title="November 12, 2007  8:10AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ross, here's the door.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_107910">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107910/#Comment_107910" name="Item_145" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-12T08:30:02+00:00" title="November 12, 2007  8:30AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            BTW, Jason, did you get what you were looking for out of this thread?

I'm curious about how the writing styles match up with roleplaying styles.  Like, does 18th century prose have an equivalent (or at least parallel) gaming style?

[...] For example, I sometimes use and "character immerse" in stock npcs when doing traditional GMing. I can focus my conscious attention on directing story, dealing with rules calls, making sure everyone is engaged, etc. and portray the simple npc easily and automatically. [...] [Secondly,] I Immerse in Character with a potentially complex character. This generates a stream of reflexive impulses about what the character should do. But simultaneously I also consciously think about what the character would do. At any given moment, I choose whether to go with my "gut" or my "mind" for what the character should do.</blockquote>\nAh, interesting.  When you talk about making something reflexive, you mean so that you can look at other things, whereas I think about acting intuitively as a way to tap into another part of yourself, to give things added emotional weight, unpredictaility, and a semblance of reality.  But I think that the distinction you're making between reflexive manipulation and total immersion still holds up despite our differences in goals.  Even when I'm feeling my character vividly and controlling her reflexively, I don't necessarily want to turn off my inner commentary on themes and narrative structure and such -- it looks more like what you're talking about as character immersion, possibly plus story flow.  I don't think it's really possible to make sharp distinctions between intuitive immersion in character versus setting or story, though, because especially if you're not handling them consciously, those elements blend together.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: cydmab</cite>So I'll consider methods that might help block out thinking about anything other than character.</blockquote>\nI could see these techniques working.  Another way to do the same thing would be repeating something to yourself, e.g. continuously saying the Hail Mary in the back of your head during a battle scene.  I do this sort of thing from time to time, and I think it probably helps with maintaining immersion, though sometimes I don't even realize I'm doing it until I get up to go to the bathroom.  I hadn't thought about it before as a way to get into immersion, though theoretically it would both increase task loading and create a lens for viewing the rest of the situation through.  But then if you found yourself overloaded on tasks and needing to put attention elsewhere, you could stop it without breaking anything.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4696/talk-to-me-about-immersion/p3" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4696/talk-to-me-about-immersion">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4696/talk-to-me-about-immersion/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4696/talk-to-me-about-immersion/p3" rel="prev">3</a><a class="Highlight p-4 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4696/talk-to-me-about-immersion/p4">4</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F4696%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F4696%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
