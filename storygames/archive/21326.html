It has mostly been played at Story Games Seatle, which is a single-session gaming group.

I've enjoyed writing it, but don't really have any interest in the other steps needed to do something like a kickstarter.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/mike_anderson">@mike_anderson</a> As others have mentioned, it was designed with one-shots in mind and I have never tried playing it over anything longer than a 3-4 hour session. In theory you could go longer, but I think you'd find that without at least mixing up the emotions you are playing it would soon start to become a bit repetitive and stale. Good campaign systems tend to have some mechanics for character advancement, and this has none of that (just cyclical power shifts in which emotions are strongest)<br/><br/>That being said, I think there is certainly room to experiment with telling multiple stories in the same universe (either jumping around in the same person's life like Ben suggested, or taking a favorite NPC from the previous game and making them the protagonist of your next game) and if you want to try something like that, I'm certainly interested in hearing how it goes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466998">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/davey" title="davey"><img alt="davey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/739/n2UJ50N52BV5N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/davey">davey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466998/#Comment_466998" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-14T00:43:00+00:00" title="October 14, 2017 12:43AM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Drew,  <br/>I never seemed to be at the playtest meetups when your game got played.

I really dig the neglect queue as a mechanic for breaking ties and more important increasing the chance that all emotions get some spotlight time. I have two questions about actual game play:  one, does the equal status between emotions (all emotions have an equal chance at becoming dominant at some point in game play) lead to erratic, inconsistent behavior of the hero? If so, does this quality give emotional depth &amp; complexity to the hero or just seem random? Two, while the neglect queue helps divide spotlight time equally between emotions, it doesn't do the same for players. If I'm reading correctly, it seems possible that any given player may never get a chance to "observe the outcome" if they choose the unpopular option or just consistently roll poorly. Has this happened in play testing? If so, did the player feel left out or did the player feel like they still sufficiently contributed to game play by participating in other phases of game play (e.g., establish the dilemma -- which every player does have an equal opportunity to engage because this role rotates around the table)? Anyway, I am really intrigued by this game &amp; hope to bring it to the table soon!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467033">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/davey" title="davey"><img alt="davey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/739/n2UJ50N52BV5N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/davey">davey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467033/#Comment_467033" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-15T19:56:45+00:00" title="October 15, 2017  7:56PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mr s. And drew: Because I can't help it, I began to dream up house rules too. I was wondering the same thing. This may not be needed, may complicate things, may have been tried and rejected for these or other reasons... but I'm wondering what would happen if in addition to the roll, points were allotted at the end of debate(?) by each player. Something like this:  can't vote for yourself, 3 tokens for best argument, down to 1 token for 3rd place.  Can't vote for yourself.  Then add dice roll to that sum for the random element.   This may make it too competitive for some players.
