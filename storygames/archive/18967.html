A character showing curiousity towards their particular brand of insanity is inviting and accelerating their descent into whatever paradigm in question. By "testing" or "demonstrating" they display willingness to become the being indicated by the phenomenon.<br/><br/>As for how to deal with that mechanically, I would probably just narrate in ways that make it clear that the phenomenon is now more aggressive and dominant in their life, and will remain so unless they decide to shun it in the future. In practical terms, the GM might prepare specific material related to that power, to reflect how the character is being increasingly drawn into its paradigm. This is not to convince the player to avoid using their "power", of course; the point is to merely establish the super powers as inimical to sane humanity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
