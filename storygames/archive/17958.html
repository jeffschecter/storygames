Your advice would be greatly appreciated, and on the off chance it isn't appreciated, at least read.  Thank you.<br/><br/>(pointless edit) I meant Thursday.  Yeah, I got enough time to do this shit.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406082">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406082/#Comment_406082" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-12T21:31:55+00:00" title="February 12, 2013  9:31PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 12, 2013 9:39PM by Rickard.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's crucial that the PCs are factions that compete or intrigue with each other, otherwise the game wont proceed. My group never grasped that the first time we played, so we tried to hang around like the posse in The Walking Dead. Needless to say, that session wasn't good. I would rather play it as Battlestar Galactica with factions fighting within the community while a threat (zombies/cylons) is growing outside the community.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406104/#Comment_406104" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-13T05:21:30+00:00" title="February 13, 2013  5:21AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<del>Try to </del>find a conflict in each scene.  Push towards one.<br/><br/>It might be over who gets to hold the shotgun, or who eats the last donut, or who gets away with the bag of money.<br/><br/>Zombie Cinema is about the characters, but they are in a tense and life-threatening situation, and even petty things drive a wedge sometimes.  The game lives and dies on that tension.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406121/#Comment_406121" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-13T07:59:45+00:00" title="February 13, 2013  7:59AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What Harlequin said. Explain to the players that the game is flat-out about the characters <i>not</i> sticking together in a crisis, not about fighting zombies. It's not just stylistic advice: mechanically you cannot move up the "escape path" if you don't have disagreements between the characters. If you all stick together, everyone gets eaten.<br/><br/>Bring it up when people are making characters. Encourage them to make characters who will not get along. Watching your character get eaten after being a jerk should be fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
