The game lies somewhere between Traveller, Star Trek, Firefly and the Vorkosigan series. The primary driving themes are "The galaxy is full of deadly beauty" and "Everyone has someone pulling their strings". The game is divided by the web of inter-faction politics in civilized space and the beauty and danger of 'wild space'. Lots of exploration and space travel.<br/><br/>Careers:<br/>- Military<br/>- Commercial<br/>- Scientific<br/>- Industrial<br/>- Personality<br/>- Clandestine<br/>- Scoundrel<br/>- Cybernetic<br/>- Explorer<br/>- Starfarer<br/><br/>Characters are made by combining two careers to make their "class"; a Military/Clandestine might be an infiltrator or sniper, a Scientific/Scoundrel could be a drug-dealer or performing illegal research, etc. Long story short, each career has 5 skills/abilities to choose from. BUT I'm having trouble coming up with the Starfarer's 5th skill.<br/><br/>Starfarer is all about interstellar travel, especially through civilized space. It is the mirror of the "Explorer" career, which focuses on exploring the unknown and is rather terrestrial-based. Here are the skills that I have so far for the Starfarer<br/>- <b>Cosmopolitan</b>: You know a little bit about every civilized planet<br/>- <b>Opportunity</b>: When in civilized space, you can always find exactly the kind of job you're looking for.<br/>- <b>Pilot</b>: You have a small vehicle (shuttle, fighter) and a hangar bay for it.<br/>- <b>Zero-G</b> Training: You never suffer penalties for being in zero-g.<br/><br/>So, I'm looking for a skill or ability that compliments that career. Something fitting for a Space Opera style game, possibly even inspired by popular sci-fi. If anyone has any suggestions or ideas, I'd really appreciate it. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419882/#Comment_419882" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-11T02:28:53+00:00" title="August 11, 2013  2:28AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What's wrong with a simple "star-navigation/astrogation" type of skill? <br/><br/><b>- Astrogation</b>: You know how to get between planets and star-systems in the most effective ways.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419885">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d" title="Archangel3d"><img alt="Archangel3d" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nHJSFRW82OXJ8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d">Archangel3d</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419885/#Comment_419885" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-11T10:07:50+00:00" title="August 11, 2013 10:07AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's... that's really not bad at all. Something to cut down travel time, both physically (best calibrations for wormhole, best telemetry for slingshots) and socially (you always have all your forms and galactic passports in order, know the fastest way through planetary customs inspections)<br/><br/>Yeah. Yeah that works well. Seems so obvious in hindsight. Awesome, thanks Vulp!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
