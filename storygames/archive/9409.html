Partly because with the group's busy social life its always easier the smaller the group, and partly because I live with Mo and that just makes it too convenient. <br/><br/>Some things that I've noticed about it: <br/><br/>1) There is no place to hide. In this kind of gaming you both have to be there and you both have to bring it. There is no "I'll sit back while Judd does his awesome for a few minutes." You have to have the energy and focus to go, and the creative juice to pump into the game to make up for the fact that there are only two inputs rather than four or ten or whatever. <br/><br/>2) The nice thing is the focus. Because of the above, when you do bring it, there is far less noise to contend with. Its really easy to get down and focus on what you want to do right now, to laser hone shit and pound it flat. This works from everything from being able to run single-protagonist games that look a lot more like most novels (as there is only one Conan or Batman, so there is only one PC) or even in games where you're moving around the world (say, IAWA) because there is a tighter ability to jointly and equally author. Of course, clear communications are key to making this work long term. In any 1n1 game I play the other and I always spend quite a bit of time talking about the game outside the game. (Partly because we're geeks.) Doing so really helps make sure things don't go off the rails. (Because if they do, there is no where to hide, remember?) <br/><br/>3) But it can be weird if your connection isn't right. Playing with Mo (my wife, for those who don't know) is always pretty easy one on one. But the first time I played 1n1 with some other friends it was a little... odd... the first time. There is an emotional intimacy and immediacy (at least with the way I run/play) in 1n1 gaming that comes directly from number 1 and 2. In a group you emotionally connect, sure, but 1n1 you directly plug into each other. Which can feel a little uncomfortable, depending on your relationship. The good news is that I've always found that it goes away pretty fast once you start playing. <br/><br/>4) Some games require some shifting in play priorities, expectations, or systems because of the way resource management, conflict setting, or expected input works. This can go from very easy to very difficult, depending on the game, your need to play to rule, and the flexibility of expectations. Dogs, for example, can work well 1n1 -- so long as you don't play quite as hard as you do in a group game, or are just fine with the solo Dog being killed every other town. (Without group backup and healing, its rough to be a Dog.) D&amp;D also requires some juggling with conflict scale, as the resources a single character can bring are limited. Other games with niche protection or the assumption that the characters are competent as a group rather than individuals often need to be either fine targeted or have character generation shifted. PTA needs to have fan mail looked at closely, and so on. <br/><br/>5) Good God can you whip through plot. The rate of play in 1n1 games can be very, very fast and/or very, very dense. With fewer inputs things tend to go more quickly, and you can run through scenarios and adventures and plots and whatthefuckeverforgetermyouwants really damn quick. I'm always shocked these days how long it takes group games to get stuff done. Even with tight, tight scene framing and a group used to working together my group of 4 players is lucky to get through half as much as we'll get through if its only 1n1. <br/><br/>6) One of the big, obvious shifts in technique that happens in almost every 1n1 game that I play is that we include breaks between almost every scene. In a group game that I'm GMing I'll often keep things going pretty continuously for an extended time, rotating round the table, shifting from focal character to focal character, and so forth. In 1n1 games the increased focus, speed, and need for communication means that between most scenes (except scenes that are tightly linked, like some Dogs follow up conflicts) I'll usually have a pause. We'll talk about what happened, what the next scene could be, and things such as that while we regenerate focus. This isn't hugely different than in group play, but it happens much, much more often. <br/><br/>I'm sure there is more shit I'm forgetting. Its hard to see the forest for the trees sometimes, when you're right in it. <br/><br/>I think I talked about this years ago on my blog too. <br/><br/>Oh yea, I did. <a href="http://games.spaceanddeath.com/yudhishthirasdice/11" rel="nofollow">Here it is</a>.

Brand touched on this, but one aspect I encounter in 1-on-1 that I think deserves some additional spotlighting in the discussion is making sure the momentum of the game narrative and, more importantly at times, the play experience itself is well controlled.<br/><br/>With no other players to divide time against, each player has to stay in the hot seat during the whole thing.  This can be a bit fatiguing after a shorter stretch of time.  Consider, even as GM (with your "job" being "always on"), how often you are afforded some back-off and think time when players are discussing things amongst themselves.  With just one player, more of that gap time is exposed for what it is, and we gamers seem conditioned to hide it or dress it up somehow (perhaps to create the illusion of a ceaseless play experience to match some unspoken expectation).<br/><br/>Expressly creating some pause points in the narrative and the play experience is a very good idea.  All aspects of pacing, focus, real-time pauses, and such need to be differently managed than in a game with more players and things we are used to treating as secret hidden spaces of rest in our busy game need to be arranged for by the two players or the games will be shorter (but much more packed with story/plot!) than a game with a passel of folk.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208642/#Comment_208642" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-21T17:22:00+00:00" title="May 21, 2009  5:22PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is great timing, since I've recently started discussing serious one-on-one gaming with my group, since some of them are theatre people in shows, and one of our regulars moved away.<br/><br/>Another thing I might add, based on my plans, is that when there's only one player, as a GM I am more willing to create complex houserules that require book-keeping but reinforce some aspect of the game. For example, I have plans to run solo <i>Vampire: the Requiem</i>, and I've come up with a few little tweaks to really turn the Humanity mechanic into something deeper, at the expense of forcing the player to write a bunch of stuff out on index cards. It's a modification I would never propose to a larger group, just due to the hassle of teaching the houserule to everyone, explaining why I did it, correcting people's misconceptions about it, and having to deal with the inevitable "well why don't we just do it like it is in the book?"<br/><br/>Has anyone approached the idea of doing a one-on-one <a href="http://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/78/grand-experiments-west-marches/" rel="nofollow">West Marches</a>?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208746">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208746/#Comment_208746" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-22T14:15:30+00:00" title="May 22, 2009  2:15PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've always wanted to see more 1-on-1 games where both people play a character, and take turns GMing for each other.<br/><br/>Like, if it was Lord of the Rings, one person could be playing Frodo, marching to Mordor, and the other could be Aragorn, trying to fight the War.

I was the GM, he was the player (not that we used those terms, not having immersed in the RPG scene yet) and we'd play for hours and hours on end. When I say we, I mean me and various other people. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt first, it was my buddy Paul. We had 2-3 games going at one time, once. Then I got my non-geeky friend David into a spy-game kinda one. Then my uncle Ron, who is a year younger than I. Once I moved to Phoenix, we'd be on the phone every night playing, and when we could, I'd sleep over and we'd play all damned night. We had two main ones that we always did, one a fantasy adventure thing, the other a sort of fantasy/post-apoc/primitive thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes these games even moved into multiplayer territory, but still being completely freeform, they still flowed faster than normal RPGs do. The intimacy was lost for sure, and I never felt that same sense of connection with multiplayer players, (unless they'd started out as single-player players)<br/>\n<br/>\nMan, but those were some good times.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208762">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scurvy_Platypus" title="Scurvy_Platypus"><img alt="Scurvy_Platypus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scurvy_Platypus">Scurvy_Platypus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208762/#Comment_208762" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-22T17:18:10+00:00" title="May 22, 2009  5:18PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I've done a fair amount of one-on-one games with my wife too.<br/><br/>The topic has come up a number of times at rpg.net and I usually make the same points that Brand does, only not as thorough.<br/><br/>System can be an issue definitely. The number of games that actively supports one-on-one play is pretty small. Yes, I do have Beast Hunters <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Personally, I'm fine with one-on-one play; it produces some very different game experiences compared to group play. The aspect of intimacy is...present, I guess you could say. With the one-on-one nature, you've got this back and forth and focused attention going on. It's the sort of thing you usually only get with really good friends or someone you're involved with (or wish to be). I personally find myself tiring a lot quicker than in group play, because of that "always on" aspect.<br/><br/>About the only thing else I can think about is an explicit mention of "what you do in the game". Make sure there's a variety. For example, if you're doing D&amp;D, the primary thing to do is fight. That's the basic premise of the game at least. With one-on-one play though, there's only a limited number of fights you're really going to feel like doing, before it's like, "Yeah yeah, we've done that. Anything else?" Just tossing in a couple of skill checks doesn't really break up the monotony. So what Brand was talking about in <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a> is what this really relates to, but it's slightly off in a different direction.<br/><br/>Group play is a lot like salsa.

When I do IAWA 1n1 we usually have multiple characters each and pass back and forth between characters, and who GMs and who plays, every scene. (Its one of the few ways I've made IAWA totally work 1n1, with only one character the We Owe List goes screwy.) <br/><br/>Beast Hunters, of course, was built exactly for this kind of play. Christian or Lisa once told me that they usually played one full story, flip GM, play another full story. Mo and I, however, always played it where we'd flip GMs every scene. Or sometimes, in the middle of a scene to create a cliffhanger. (We had an old, old hunting knife that we'd pass back and forth to represent "who's the hunter now." It was fun, and no one lost an eye.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208777">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa" title="Mike Montesa"><img alt="Mike Montesa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2395/2470886071_32bd4c6f2f.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa">Mike Montesa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208777/#Comment_208777" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-22T22:33:56+00:00" title="May 22, 2009 10:33PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played/ran a 1-on-1 game a few years back and it was great!

I think that with the right person, these kinds of games can be amazing.<br/><br/>I used D&amp;D 3rd, d6 system, and super-high epic D&amp;D 3rd to the point where it might as well have been a different game. <br/><br/>I think it has a lot to do with if you 'click' with the other player. Although at one point (in the super epic D&amp;D game) I ran three solos at once in the same world, where the players were gods, and they'd react to each others actions and the shifting environment, periodically teaming up or fighting each other in cross-over events. That was a bitchin' campaign.<br/><br/>Anyways, its a pretty awesome way of playing. But only when its with people you click with. Fortunately, at least for me, you can usually tell whether it's going to work or not fairly early on, often before you even start.

I suspect it would have worked vastly better with a mentality more akin to the one common at the time it was written ( essentially, The GM comes up with a mission, the player plays it while interpretting their character, the GM rects and modfies as necessary).<br/><br/>BW, in my opinion, was horrifically simmy, a bit like playing CoC without all your necessary bases covered skill-wise. I fact, I can see a pre-written CoC adventure, played straight with only a single PC involved, turning out much the same way: an excersise in frustration due to never having a broad enough spread of competencies to interact with opposition in any manner approaching even a fifty-fifty shot of success in any instance. Throw on top of that the call to add complications due to failure, and it rapidly became a morass of suck with next to no high-points of success to counteract it.<br/><br/>Except in CoC, your PC going it alone would likely get snuffed or go mad, so at least play could end.<br/><br/>Of course, that isn't much different from playing B/X D&amp;D one-on-one at low level either. The game mechanics seem balanced towards group play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208815">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208815/#Comment_208815" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-23T11:07:45+00:00" title="May 23, 2009 11:07AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Huh, that isn't my take on BW at all (obviously).<br/><br/>Case in point: <a href="http://www.burningwheel.org/forum/showthread.php?t=7758" rel="nofollow">The Shepherd.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208816">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208816/#Comment_208816" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-23T11:10:19+00:00" title="May 23, 2009 11:10AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm an outlier on the whole BW thing.

For me there are three basic pressures that work towards drift/freeform/something else in 1n1 games. <br/><br/>1) Many of the folks I play 1n1 with (especially Mo with whom I play 1n1 the most) are fans of rules light or freeformy games, and have a strong preference for active gestalt play. They're like this in a lot of games, not just 1n1 games. And so when I play with them 1n1 and under the increased intimacy of the game, it makes less sense to deny them their preference. <br/><br/>2) As I mentioned upthread, my experience playing a lot of 1n1 games is that they need some drift to work right anyway. Because they weren't designed for it, there is often something -- be it mechanical, procedural, or ephemeral -- that has to be shifted and realigned in order to fit the dynamics of 1n1 play well. So, since I'm often drifting anyway, the propensity to drift just a little bit more is strong. After all, once you've already got the engine open and are resetting the timer, why not add some nitrous too? (Yes, sometimes it explodes, but not always!) <br/><br/>3) Many systems have as part of their substratal makeup a mode of controlling and structuring procedures of play that has a lot to do with the co-ordination and meshing of different inputs. The more players you've got (IME) the more you need something procedurally strong to keep everyone together and keep things coherent. OTOH, when you've got only two inputs and a clear and open line of communication between both people, the need to mitigate the direct interaction with each others creativity is reduced. Or to put it simply, when I'm dealing with Leo who is doing X, and Sarah who is doing Y and Z and Mo who is doing X and Z, and I'm doing Y and A... we need something to keep us all together. But when I'm playing with just Mo and she's doing X and Y and I'm doing X and Y... the need for external systems to negotiate our social space is much reduced. <br/><br/>That said, its rare even for Mo and I to do "full freeform." (Whatever that means.) We sometimes do diceless play, but we also tend to have some very clearly understood, if flexible, procedural frameworks around the game. Things that if they were more formalized might start to look a lot like ritual phrases or Jeep form techniques. We're far more principled than ad-hoc in most of our decisions in game, its just that the decisions rarely rely on external mechanics or game-based cues. <br/><br/>Now, that all said, I've also a few friends with whom when I play 1n1 we become more likely to heavily engage external systems. Sometimes this might be due to a lesser intimacy, but in at least two cases I can think of, its because we're the ones in the group who take the most enjoyment out of the "game" aspects of RPGs. We like to roll dice, game the system, engage in step-on-up, and play the game with the same kind of attention to rules and details that you do to a boardgame. (Where as the folks I was talking about above are much more focused on the story/acting/narrative/memories of events never lived/experience aspect of gaming.) So when I play with those guys we often get really detailed with the rules. In those games things like Judd's "Burning Wheel honestly almost feels like it was made for this kind of play with all of the fiddly bits and advancement through conflict and learning of new skills" and Adam's "s a GM I am more willing to create complex houserules that require book-keeping but reinforce some aspect of the game" really do ring true. <br/><br/>So, I guess my conclusion is that 1n1 games tend to become more defined by the desires of the two people playing: if you like to game it you may well game it even more, but if you want something else, its likely to become even more that other thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208823">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208823/#Comment_208823" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-23T16:31:12+00:00" title="May 23, 2009  4:31PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How often in 1:1 play is the system/hack one that brings some method of external input, whether it's an IAWA oracle or Mythic GM Emulator table or the "random page of Brewsters Dictionary" method? <br/><br/>I like "campaign/ongoing/long arc play" and worry that, oh I'm a wonderfully creative person and Joe is a wonderfully creative person but we each have our "go to's" and habits and over time we both know it will be tentacles and nothing-is-what-it-seems and bad-ass antiheroes who would rather see the world burn before they compromise their personal ethos.<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208827/#Comment_208827" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-23T17:05:49+00:00" title="May 23, 2009  5:05PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rob, <br/><br/>For me, almost never.

In a big group, you get a lot of friendly chatter and OOC and IC discussions if the GM needs to dip into the books for a bit. In 1-on-1, as a GM, I get frustrated really easy if I need to take time to reference anything about rules or setting.<br/><br/>I've tried:<br/><br/>Various editions of DnD - Not great for 1-on-1, for lots of reasons<br/><br/>Savage Worlds - Works really well, actually; PC's can often use allies/minions to help flesh things out for any skirmish play, and the rules are light and fast. Great for running 1-shots across different genres, which I did regularly with my son for a while.<br/><br/>Beast Hunters - Designed to support 1-on-1 play. It's got a fun, competitive vibe, and the loosely-defined setting is awesome.<br/><br/>Burning Wheel - I love it, but I'm not sure if it will ever actually hit the table. It's just hard to sacrifice the 5 or so sessions I think I'd need before I could get a head of steam on the system, and it's a bit too complex. That said, I've probably learned more about character-driven play from Burning Wheel than any other game I've ever read. It's outstanding.<br/><br/>Wordplay - just now dipping into this one seriously, but it looks really good.

Using the d6 system, IIRC. It was fun and we were able to really capture the feel of the comics between the two of us. I also ran a couple of 1-on-1, diceless Call of Cthulhu games for our band's manager way, way back. That was fun. And I ran a 1-on-1 Vampire game for my wife a while back too. Brand hits on the high points in his posts. <br/><br/>We didn't switch GMs in any of those games. Although I wish we could have. 1-on-1 is really immersive, gets through lots of story and I've found it easier to create collaborative stories 1-on-1. Maybe the comfort factor is higher. Not sure. But I found the goofy factor of a game to often be comparable to the number of people in a game and their median degree of comfort with each other.<br/><br/>So while 1-on-1 the Batman game felt, smelt and tasted like the Batman, running essentially the same adventure (adjusted for group size) for 7 people the Batman goes all goofy.

Games usually turn into action and adventure fests with groups that are playing for escape and coolgoodfun.  The desire to explore some thematic issue may simply not appeal to them as a use of the SIS.

The notion of the players being on the same "side", or at least not in opposition, reflects the (sadly, dead) CCG <i>Middle Earth: the Wizards</i>. That was the basic set for the game, and players each controlled a Wizard and his agents and allies. Since Wizards are (mostly) all on the same side (that whole Saruman defection wasn't covered 'til a later set...), there was no direct conflict between players; on your opponent's turn, you play Hazards (monsters, Sauron's forces, wild beasts, and misfortune) to hinder and harm his Wizard and his characters. <br/>They eventually introduced "bad guys" in sets like <i>Dark Minions</i>, <i>The Lidless Eye</i> (where you can play as a Ringwraith!) - these sets featured direct conflict between groups of characters for the first time in the game. I believe there was a set called <i>The Balrog</i>, as well, which focused on the Underdeeps, the sort of tunnels that Gollum knew all about, running under Middle-Earth.<br/>Anyway, if you have a GM-swapping thing going on, it's important to have the PCs run into each other as infrequently as possible, if ever, lest you get into a situation where it becomes really tricky to manage conflict efficiently. <br/>Vincent Baker has written on his blag (especially with regard to an old <i>Ars Magica</i> game he played) about the importance of keeping players' interests at odds in some way with something, either that of the GM or of one another. The conflict has to come from somewhere!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_209707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod" title="MacLeod"><img alt="MacLeod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/734/nPH37A6Q7QKN7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod">MacLeod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209707/#Comment_209707" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-31T02:30:50+00:00" title="May 31, 2009  2:30AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I GM'd some 1-on-1 RPGs almost exclusively for about 6 years straight.

We're talking about doing religious urban fantasy in the style of the movies The Prophecy or Constantine (or some comics that Daniel knows and I don't). The main character will be mortal, have no powers, have no destiny, but get drawn into supernatural shit that he wants to change.<br/><br/>I'm thinking of using Dogs in the Vineyard with small hacks to make it work. My main concern is keeping him alive, and my first thought was that Dogs lets me push pretty hard as a GM and not immediately kill off the single character. I just need to avoid making his death part of the scene goal / stakes. Daniel can always Give in his conflicts to avoid the inevitable escalation to violence. If he doesn't, and his character dies, then it was a meaningful death.<br/><br/>Script immunity (or protagonist survivability) seems to be a pretty important aspect of a game suited to 1x1 play. Otherwise, the GM needs to run an Illusionist game to keep the protagonist alive.

IME the difference between what you can do as a single Dog vs a Dog thats part of a group is pretty major, and the transition will decrease the PCs ability to easily effect change. (Its doable, but you have to go smaller, hit people where they're weak, and so on. It is much rougher, and a lot of people seem to undersell it. Their experience may just differ, but damn...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Solo Games

I know some diced non-freeform systems that work for one on one play (like <a href="http://www.berengad.com/main/" rel="nofollow">Beast Hunters</a> and <a href="http://www.indiepressrevolution.com/xcart/product.php?productid=16173" rel="nofollow">Breaking the Ice</a>), because they were designed specifically for one on one play. Trollbabe also works pretty well for it, but the idea that it might be played freeform would make Ron's head explode. <br/><br/>The sad truth is that I don't know any freeform diceless systems that are available to the public that I've really liked for 1 on 1 play. (Hell, there are only a small number of diceless freeform games that I like at all, and most of them are Jeeps or Jeep inspired. Maybe the new structured freeform movement will fix this. Dave Cleaver is working on a game for 1 gm and 2 players, so maybe he'll stop being lazy and write a game for 1 player and 1 GM.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_210312">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210312/#Comment_210312" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-04T09:41:12+00:00" title="June  4, 2009  9:41AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brand is smarter and better informed than I am.

It's collaborative storytelling at that point, which may not be game-y enough for (me) some people. <br/><br/>Of course, to address Diegan's point, the whole point of rules is to take improv acting's mantra, "Yes, and..." and turn it into "Yes, or [roll the dice, etc.]". Rare indeed would be the 2-person improv crew that could deliver several sessions of plot and adversity and whatnot that the players themselves find interesting. I keep thinking of that Vincent Baker phrase, "dull, aimless play"; it applies to GMless gaming and the pitfalls therein, but I think it can loosely apply here, as it does deal explicitly with Credibility.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_210486">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210486/#Comment_210486" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-05T08:18:51+00:00" title="June  5, 2009  8:18AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What makes a game well suited for 1x1 play?<br/><br/>We've talked about some things, but I'd like to draw out more things that make 1x1 play easier.

When you have a group of related characters and one or two of them die, the others carry the torch of continuity forward. The story doesn't die with the deceased characters.

First up, two players doesn't mean one character (see <i>Breaking the Ice</i>) . Second, if there is only one character,then character death is unlikely to be player punishment (in that the game most likely has to stop instead of continuing on without you as you either get relegated to audience or creating another character and waiting for re-insertion).<br/><br/>But then again, I'm rarely a fan of death in RPGs, so maybe I'm a bit biased.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>What makes a game well suited for 1x1 play?</blockquote>\nWhat's funny is, I can point to games and point to specific rules that make one on one play difficult, but I have trouble pointing to games and saying, that rule makes one on one play easier.<br/><br/>Technically speaking, one thing that makes a game suited for one on one play is when the requirements for play can be spread over just two players. A lot of traditional games do this very well (since they give one player everything except control over the other players' characters), but non-traditional games often make two player play impossible (see <i>Polaris</i>).

Reinsertion/audience issues aren't as important to me as continuity issues. You invest all this time in this story and then the story ends. That sucks. Especially with the increased focus or intensity that Brand and others say 1x1 play begets.<br/><br/>I am not a fan of death in RPGs, either. In my designs, risk of death is usually an option that a player can tap for additional resources. That almost guarantees that death makes sense in the story and that it's a meaningful death for the player.\n<blockquote>Technically speaking, one thing that makes a game suited for one on one play is when the requirements for play can be spread over just two players</blockquote>\nThis seems like some kind of 1x1 gaming tautology. <br/><br/>Let me also state that I'm using "1x1" pretty deliberately.

I read KKKKK once a long time ago. I played Trollbabe for like a half hour once.

To me, a game that trades roles during play is not a lot different than a game where you trade roles between sessions / stories / whatever.

Now that Judd's clarified what he meant, I find no place for disagreement. It doesn't necessarily have to be true that dying and restarting with a new character has to be unfun. But I did say "often," not always or necessarily or anything like that. I don't think there's any contention here, unless you want to debate how often it sucks, which would be silly. <img alt="=)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title="=)"/><br/><br/>Yes, I agree that talking about actual play and specific concerns will be more fruitful.<br/><br/>I can't think of a specific AP, but I can make up a hypothetical one that I <i>swear to God</i> is typical of real situations I've been in. In other words, I forget the specifics. <br/><br/>So I'm the DM in a D&amp;D 3E game. We've been playing for 6-8 months, every other week, and the characters are 6th level. Jesse plays a human wizard named Andricon and he's become pretty pivotal to a lot of the events in the game. He's trying to overthrow this king that he knows is really, really evil. It's Andricon's fight because it's personal and the other PCs have been drawn in to help. They legitimately want to overthrow the king, too, now. The king catches on and sends a Vrock demon after the party and the fucker kills Andricon, who is a squishy wizard. <br/><br/>Jesse can create another character and jump back into the game, sure, but losing Andricon wasn't fun for him. Furthermore, it isn't fun for me as DM, because Jesse and I had worked out a ton of great stuff about how his character tied into the setting and we were excited to see how it would affect play.<br/><br/>On the other hand, it would feel totally bogus and cheating and stuff to just not kill Andricon. Battles from then on would seem like charades.<br/><br/>So I said, "It's also often NOT FUN to restart with a new character." This is one of those cases. You said it doesn't always have to be that way. How do I avoid it in this case? Saying "use different rules" is not fair cricket.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210544">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210544/#Comment_210544" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-05T11:17:38+00:00" title="June  5, 2009 11:17AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So it's clear, in my AP example I am talking about <i>loss of investment</i> in a character.

I think the key is that there has to be something that the player (and GM, actually) is invested in, that is "immortal" - whether the character, or the situation, or the setting, or other things I haven't thought of.  If character death is a real, and especially a common, occurrence, it will tend to de-emphasize investment in the character.  But that's not a problem if that's not where the action is.  One of the systems I'd suggested for 1x1 play to Adam was Darkpages, because the imprint is a sort of "character."  Heroes might come and go but the problems of Whatever City remain, and are addressed by new ones.  I could also see a game that focused on situation - if my PC dies, next week we pick up the story 20 years later when a new foolish academic hears tell of the Opprobrious Octagon and takes up my failed quest to destroy it...<br/><br/>I'm not sure how to generalize this.  People will become most invested in the thing that's constant, I think, is my general armchair point (it may be wrong, but it seems right, at the moment) - so as long as there's some constant, cool - but it may change the "feel" of the game.  If you want that to be character, however, it seems that there are any number of ways to do this - systems like Dogs and Trollbabe that let the player set a "death flag" as it were, or even just an agreement beforehand to play by something like "action movie rules" - no matter how bad the situation, the hero never gets killed, only captured, etc.  Or even just do something in the fiction, if appropriate - I'm sure a lot of folks here have played Planescape: Torment, back in the day.  Or, hell, even just hand-wave it: in plenty of computer games, you can go back to a saved game... in the fiction, that's completely incoherent, but most people don't lose any sleep over it.  And it doesn't make challenges "meaningless" - *I* know I munged that combat and had to reboot, and if I don't care about that for its own sake, no one is putting a gun to my head and making me play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_210553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210553/#Comment_210553" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-05T11:56:19+00:00" title="June  5, 2009 11:56AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Unwhispering a comment I made to Judd.

"If your charater dies along the way, you choose a relationship you have as your next character to pick up your jacket, pistols, horse and sanctified earth and continue the journey."

However, there are so many more interesting options than death.  The GM needs to be careful about putting the character into dangerous situations where being hurt really badly but being allowed to be nursed back to health, being captured, etc. are on the table long before flat-out death.<br/><br/>That said, I am about to not GM but play as a PC in a solo game in the coming weeks, so perhaps my thoughts on the matter will change.<br/><br/>Burning Wheel does this really well.  It is really easy to get knocked unconscious but fairly difficult to die.<br/><br/>I like Dogs because you have to really choose that escalation and the player can always give up and not take the fall-out.  Dying is in the player's court; it is their decision to take that damage and decide that a conflict is worth dying for.<br/><br/>D&amp;D 4e seems like a really bad choice to me because the game is so based around teamwork and death can come quickly and brutally, when minions gang up, it is NASTY, especially if your character isn't geared towards taking those kind of critters out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210556">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210556/#Comment_210556" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-05T12:04:27+00:00" title="June  5, 2009 12:04PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.story-games.com/codex/index.php?title=Kazekami_Kyoko_Kills_Kublai_Khan" rel="nofollow">Kazekami Kyoko</a> and my other two-player games -- <a href="http://thouandone.wordpress.com/projects/heavenly-kingdoms/" rel="nofollow">Heavenly Kingdoms</a>, <a href="http://plays-well.com/Waiting-Tea.pdf" rel="nofollow">Waiting for the Queen/Tea at Midnight</a>, and <a href="http://thouandone.wordpress.com/projects/while-youre-far-away/" rel="nofollow">While You're Far Away</a> -- all don't have GMs.  The two players have different roles, but it's not the same as the standard player-GM relationship.

Like, at all. The whole setup of the game is about teamwork, the way powers work and stack is based on the unit and not the individual, and so... yea. <br/><br/>However, I suppose it could be possible to play with one GM and one player who plays 4 characters, or 5. Play the Pandavas (five brothers who almost always get along and support each other and are supernaturally bad ass, Yudhishithira the Warlord, Arjuna the Ranger, Bhima the Fighter, Nakula the Swordmage, and Sahadeva the Inovker) and just accept that the group is going to work as though they have one mind. Probably be a lot of paperwork for the player though. <br/><br/>This is the thing that I dislike most in systems I'm trying to get to work 1 on 1 are places where niche protection or the need to force characters in the setting to work together as a group have informed the mechanical setup of the game. So D&amp;D classes, obviously, but also other games where the currency of the system is based on a group dynamic (say, fan mail). There are so many games that would almost be awesome for one on one play, but aren't because they don't function well without a group. Which I can't really even blame them for, as getting people at the table to work together is hard, and most really good systems have some method to help make it happen. So hating on them for making part of their system inherent to the group is just selfish. <br/><br/>Interestingly, survivability has rarely been an issue for me (except in a few shocking cases with Dogs 1 on 1 where we didn't see it coming...). Partly its because of the systems we use (PDQ, FATE, Trollbabe, etc), and partly because in systems where character death is more probable based on rolls we usually came up with some in fiction break on the lethality. Like, in the long running Unknown Armies game (which can spit characters out fast if you aren't careful) there were several early episodes in which the PC made alliances with an order of magical healers, gained extra hitpoints by gambling her soul with "the devil" (just a Merchant, actually), and so on. Also, knowing me, I probably ride light on the dice when I see the potential for character death by accident. Because I'm bad that way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210567">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Levine" title="Daniel Levine"><img alt="Daniel Levine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Levine">Daniel Levine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210567/#Comment_210567" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-05T12:25:55+00:00" title="June  5, 2009 12:25PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't want to derail this into "what Daniel or Adam, in particular, want out of a 1x1 game," really... so I'm a bit uncomfortable commenting specifically on the Destiny issue.<br/><br/>But, it does, I think, speak a bit more to this issue about continuity, when taken a step back into abstraction.<br/><br/>There are two separate questions here, I think.  The first is, "what, in the game system, supports continuity, and how?"  The second is, "what, in the fiction, supports continuity, and how?"<br/><br/>Take a principle like, "the PC never dies."  That could be a procedural/system rule: whenever you go to zero HP (or whatever), you suffer a complication, instead of dying.  But, it need not be an in-fiction rule - in the fiction, death might be perfectly possible, it just never happens to you and there is always *some* in-fiction reason why the bad guys don't just off you when they have you at their mercy.  This is akin to what I was calling "action movie logic."  It's not part of the fiction that Rambo *can't* die - it's a genre convention.<br/><br/>But you *could* make it part of the fiction, e.g., like the Nameless in Torment.  That gives it a different feel, but is the same from the standpoint of confidence in investing time and emotion in your character.<br/><br/>The reason I make this point is that, for games where you really don't want a particular character's story to end before a certain meaningful point is reached, it's important to separate them.  The fact that I don't want my character to have a Destiny in Adam's game is that I wanted to get away from the notion that you need to be supernaturally elect to do cool stuff, for what are basically philosophical reasons - I want to tell a story about some person who does cool stuff because s/he chooses to, and works at it, not because someone blessed him or her.<br/><br/>But that's totally compatible with a system in which we know, for extra-fictional reasons, that death will never befall the character.  Destiny is an in-fiction explanation.  Similar things with "if you fail, someone will pick up your quest."  You *could* explain that with an in-fiction destiny or guiding hand. Or it could be an assumption about the game you're playing, but in fiction, it just happens to work out that way.<br/><br/>So, a lot of this seems, no offence, like much ado about nothing.  Whenever one sits down to game, there's a certain expectation about what kind of game this is going to be, and that involves what kind of consequences there can be.  If you want "realistic" consequences, then you're also saying, "I want a realistic story, where sometimes people die for no good reason, and things don't get resolved."  If you don't want death on the table, then I don't think it's all that different from saying that the PC will never get raped, or never get constipated, or never contract an STD, or any number of other consequences that get ruled out all the time because they're trivial, or upsetting, or just don't fit the game people want.

It happens.  If it happened in a movie, you would probably go, "Wait... that's it?  That sucked."  (Or, if you're me, you'd go, "Wait... that's it?  That... was awesome."

You are not going to run a game where I have to roll for random plane crashes, or where I roll to see if I slip in the tub and crack my skull open.  I doubt you're even thinking of a game where there is a chance of wandering monsters that arrive regardless of what you or I want.

You could definitely "die by emote" and that could be potentially really cool, but it would have no mechanical trigger or effect.  You could continue player or not, as you wished (maybe one character is now a ghost).<br/><br/>Honestly, it seems like a lot of the things that are problems for two-player sandbox/strongly-GM'ed games are taken completely off the table in more focused games, but I don't think that's surprising really.  Similarly, you don't have to worry about making Spot checks in <i>My Life with Master</i>.  What this suggests to me that games that are specifically designed for two players -- <i>either by the original designer or hacked by the players to make them supportive of two-player play</i> -- can avoid many of the problems raised here.  There are plenty of games, for example, where characters don't die unless it's thematically appropriate and/or players quazi-agree, <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> being among them (the likelihood of dying, unless you take a shit-ton of gun damage, is nearly zero; and you can always Give way before then).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210591">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210591/#Comment_210591" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-05T13:25:03+00:00" title="June  5, 2009  1:25PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Daniel Levine</cite>But think of it this way: I don't believe you when you say that death needs to be there, full stop, for you to suspend disbelief.

Fighting/weapons do d8 fallout; I think that includes fists. 2d8 that rolls 16 pushes the wound category up a notch, as if you'd rolled 19-20, right?  I've seen enough games that had characters need medical attention from other Dogs, and even seen Dogs die (several times), so I know it's possible. Requires taking a TON of fallout d8's and d10's though.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>What goes do handle this continuity investment problem?</blockquote>\nI'm parsing this as "What games do handle..." Is that correct?<br/><br/>Hell, I don't know of any, but that doesn't mean they don't exist. Daniel suggest that Darkpages sorta does with imprints, or any game with "if you fail, someone will pick up your quest" as a central conceit.  I'm not sure those solutions really satisfy me, though. The investment I'm talking about is investment in the storyline of a certain character. To satisfy my whining, a game has to continue a character's storyline after the character's storyline ends with the character's death. Immortality or reincarnation are "death cheats." The best solution I've heard is what I think of as "quest inheritance." Maybe you find the dead character's journal and the new character becomes highly invested (in the fiction) in the dead character's story and picks up where she left off.<br/><br/>My other answer is that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">most</span> RPGs handle this problem by distributing investment in a storyline among a group of characters, so that it takes a TPK to end it. When one character's death is a TPK, this isn't really a solution though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_210603">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210603/#Comment_210603" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-05T13:52:51+00:00" title="June  5, 2009  1:52PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Daniel Levine</cite>I don't want to derail this into "what Daniel or Adam, in particular, want out of a 1x1 game," really... so I'm a bit uncomfortable commenting specifically on the Destiny issue.</blockquote>\nFair enough.

Another is: the story might get a bad ending.<br/><br/>Continuity only seems to be a special problem for the first; DitV, etc. address the second pretty well.

If the story is fundamentally about *this guy*, well, then the story sort of has to end when his story ends.  That was part of my point about putting investment in something else - the quest, the setting, etc.  But if you want to tell a character-driven story, well, everything after s/he leaves the story is denoument.  I could see a cool epilogue as you play with other characters who were affected by the PC's life and death - but that would be a limited sort of thing.  The story might end when it's ready to end, even if the players want to keep playing.  That's fine.  We can still be friends.  We can tell other stories.  I guess the sort of continuity you're looking for might be just incompatible with a single-character-driven story, but not in a bad way.  And I understand your problem, if it has nothing to do with the circumstances of death - I just don't share it.<br/><br/>As for specifics of the game... all there are right now are some sketchy notes:<br/><br/>The idea was that the main PC would go from place to place, dealing with problems caused by demons and angels.  The current conceit is that s/he's a travel psychiatric nurse (so he can move from place to place - and hears about supernatural activity not b/c people in this world have romanticized Hollywood mental illness, but b/c people show up with, like PTSD, from encounters).  The PC's only "power" is the courage to deal with these things, and tries to do so mostly non-violently (you know, like most people try to solve problems without whipping out a gun).  <br/><br/>But Adam hasn't even responded to my notes yet, so this all may change.

Also, that I'm been so almost-sick for the past few days that I spend all my evenings asleep on the couch.\n<blockquote>What's the problem again?<br/><br/>One version is: the story might end before we're ready to stop playing.

If I do a lot of prep and your character dies prematurely, I feel a little sad. I guess if the ending is so cool, so awesome, so exciting, so compelling that I'm on the edge of my seat with you, then it's really cool for me. I don't know how to make death happen that way reliably. Maybe Dogs-escalation is enough.\n<blockquote>The first is maybe a problem with wanting to carry things on for the sake of carrying them on.

I don't want to carry things on for the sake of carrying them on. I'd stop when the character died. I just don't want to invest in a setting, a situation, a character, and then have it evaporate before I've gotten X units of fun out of it. There's a start-up cost S for any game. There's a maintenance cost C(i) for each session increment (i) of play. The total investment of play for i sessions is S + Sum[C(i)]. That has to exceed the pay-out of fun at all times for me to feel the game was fun.<br/><br/>Mind you, I don't actually think of games in these terms at all, but I suspect my satisfaction is modeled something like that. Showing up and hanging out with friends is fun in and of itself, though.<br/><br/>I fear I am coming off as very neurotic now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210685">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210685/#Comment_210685" name="Item_104" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-05T23:16:58+00:00" title="June  5, 2009 11:16PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 5, 2009 11:21PM by Brand_Robins.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Doesn't sound neurotic to me. Sounds like a lot of the stuff that Mo and I talk about all the time, actually. <br/><br/>Now, that said, I'm not exactly sure what I can say to help resolve it. There are some paradigm things going on, where if you can hop paradigms a lot of the answers are easy, but if you don't want to, then its much more difficult to find a resolution. Much of this you guys have already covered: the difference between a world driven game, a situation driven game, and a character driven game for example. So I'm going to go forward assuming you know the different paradigms and the arguments for them and try to work with what you're saying you want, rather than trying to tell you why you're dumb and broken to not convert. <br/><br/>It sounds like between the two of you, there is some leaning towards a more character driven style. (This is the default stance for a lot of the folks I play with, so I may be mishearing slightly because I'm assuming what you're saying is more like them than it actually is.) And combined with that you don't want the character to die randomly, or for insufficient reason, and you don't want to have to participationist it to make it work. <br/><br/>So I guess my first question would be: is it important to you to have a system where character death is something that can be put on the line by mechanics? Like, will it hurt the feel of the game for you if the game can't/won't make the character die as a result of dice rolls? Or if it will only do it as a result of you specifically putting it on the line?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_210791">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210791/#Comment_210791" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-07T09:56:18+00:00" title="June  7, 2009  9:56AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>I think that's the crux of it.

A random fistfight must have a chance of causing death or I won't be happy, but if it does cause death I will be unhappy, just sounds, to me, like saying, I want to be unhappy (or there will be no random fistfights in this game). The only healthy way I can view, there must be a chance of death is: when the character dies I will be happy (note, the word happy is probably the wrong one, maybe satisfied would be better (I am not happy to lose at Monopoly, but I am satisfied)). Otherwise, it seems bizarre to play with rules that will lead to unhappiness (lack of satisfaction).<br/><br/>I played <i>Amber</i> for years, and <i>Amber</i>, in theory, had death on the table, but the rules were also clear that instead of death it was better, considering the expected level of character investment (like what you're talking about), to go with other negative consequences instead (imprisonment, torture, destruction of trust, death of comrades and friends, hatred, fear, loathing, and guilt).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210800/#Comment_210800" name="Item_106" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-07T13:04:37+00:00" title="June  7, 2009  1:04PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite>So I guess my first question would be: is it important to you to have a system where character death is something that can be put on the line by mechanics?

But I think the answer is more complicated than those two choices. I know what you're getting at, but I want to qualify my answer to be absolutely clear.<br/><br/>What makes it complicated is consideration of the trigger that puts death on the line. Can a player's choices in the fiction put death on the line, or must the player explicitly say "death is on the line here"?<br/><br/>In the latter instance, the player can refuse to say "death is on the line here" and continue to have the character do crazy things in the fiction -- taking bullets to the head, jumping off skyscrapers, etc. -- and the character will not die. It is up to us to figure out why not.<br/><br/>In the former instance, the player might choose to have his character do something crazy, like take a bullet to the head, and that will automatically trigger possibility of death. Maybe it also triggers some kind of benefit that makes it less likely the player will have to take those consequences, maybe not. <br/><br/>As I write this, I realize it's a player trust issue. And I trust Daniel, so it's not even a Daniel-trust issue. It's some dumb-ass, generic player trust issue that makes me worry that a player might abuse the fiction. My feeling is that when the rules take death off the table and put them into your hands entirely, you have a responsibility to put death on the table when the story calls for it. It would feel bogus to me to have a character do all these death-defying things and be death-defyingly awesome, when I and the player know that death was never actually a possibility. I think that's why I like rules that can put death on the table in exchange for something else the player wants (usually resolution bonuses) -- so the player can actually risk his character's death when it's a really meaningful choice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_210801">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210801/#Comment_210801" name="Item_107" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-07T13:08:33+00:00" title="June  7, 2009  1:08PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: chearns</cite>A random fistfight must have a chance of causing death or I won't be happy, but if it does cause death I will be unhappy, just sounds, to me, like saying, I want to be unhappy (or there will be no random fistfights in this game).</blockquote>\nPlease give me a little more credit! I don't want to be unhappy.<br/><br/>I definitely don't want random and mild violence to have a chance of causing death. In fact, I don't want mild violence to cause death, ever. I'm not looking to simulate reality in my games. I just don't want unreality to jump up and beat me about the face with violence to my intuition.

I really have to think hard about that. There aren't that many games where the mechanics can't cause the end of a character, are there? <br/><br/>I have played: Primetime Adventures (death is possible only as a scene goal you agree to), My Life with Master (death is possible only as an epilogue one chooses), Sons of Liberty (I don't think death is possible, but I can't remember for sure), and The Shab-al-Hiri Roach (death is possible, but not the end of the character).<br/><br/>I've only played PtA in two one-shots, so I don't really know if these problems would be serious enough to bug me in a longer game. PtA handles the implausibility problem in a different way, I think: by putting the Producer in charge of continuity. If something would be so totally unrealistic as to make the audience scratch their heads and go "WTF?!" then the Producer has a responsibility to squelch it.<br/><br/>MLwM takes meaningful death off the table during most of play. Characters just get more and more beat up. In play, we tended to dodge narration that would force us to believe the character would die. No bullets to the head. Bullets grazed or wounded. Sometimes characters ended up in the hospital for a while.<br/><br/>I only played SoL once, and it was very crazy in the fiction, so people surviving crazy things didn't matter too much. <br/><br/>Roach lets characters die and walk around as roach-controlled zombies, so it was never a problem there, either.<br/><br/>What other games take death off the table?

Now, in retrospect, that was a misunderstanding of the Sorcerer death rules.  But, in the game, it was one of the things that worked - it sort of fit the Cronenberg vibe to have these PCs hauling themselves around town when they were mutilated, bloody wrecks.  There were a lot of things about that game that didn't work, but that did work.<br/><br/>Also: I think death is more or less off the table in Misspent Youth, which I know Adam has played.<br/><br/>Thinking about my Schism example makes me think that, at some point, it helps if there is an in-fiction reason for the survivability of the character.  In the "action movie logic" I appealed to above, the convention is more that the character will never take what should be fatal wounds, because of her sheer badassery, not that she can't die from things that would kill normal people (well... I mean, explosions are a lot less deadly, but to "NPCs," too).  But yeah, it would break my suspension of disbelief to have a character take bullets to the head and never die (if she was supposed to be "normal," at least).<br/><br/>In the sort of game we're talking about, though, I think the Dogs "give" rules solve the problem fairly nicely.  We can assume that most people, and even supernatural beings, will let you back down from a fight, and not kill you if you give in.  That's pretty "realistic," to me.  <br/><br/>As for continuity and continuance, I think putting it in the player's (my) hands would be about right for the sort of game we're talking about.  I mean, I would hate to spoil your GM fun.  But, that would mean that if the death angel is like, "fuck off mortal," and I'm like, "fuck you, emo boy," I'm saying, "this is important enough; if I die here, I'd be satisfied that I did what I needed to."  I mean, there'd be plenty of room for metagame stuff like, "wait - do you realize how dangerous this is?" or maybe even "last minute gives" - "he's totally got the drop on you with the gun and is about to blow your head off... but you can probably beg for mercy," maybe with extra penalties for giving when the other guy has clearly won.<br/><br/>Or you could relax and let *me* GM for a bit.  I could totally do Darkpages, and the Imprint mechanics give me plenty of room for lonely GM fun.  Plus, it would let me feel redeemed for the playtest I was in that Jared told us to stop. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_210814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210814/#Comment_210814" name="Item_111" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-07T17:02:46+00:00" title="June  7, 2009  5:02PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>PtA handles the implausibility problem in a different way, I think: by putting the Producer in charge of continuity.

Because that is also my experience in games, not just regarding death, but regarding plausibility in general. <br/><br/>Dogs has this concept where the person with the strictest standards for plausibility is the one that's respected. And I think most games have some kind of plausibility meters. It's what allows us all to laugh and say "no really, what are you doing?" in response to someone saying, "my character shoots the moon out of the sky so that it crushes my opponent" (presuming of course we aren't playing <i>Nobilis</i>).<br/><br/>If there's no death (like in, say, <i>Dirty Secrets</i> for the Investigator), players just don't narrate death causing phenomena. I mean, nobody wants the other players at the table to be checking out from the game because they can't buy into the fiction being created. And if someone does narrate something we don't like? We talk about it. We're amongst friends.<br/><br/>I guess what I'm wondering is, why isn't that a reasonable solution for you to death in one on one games?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210822/#Comment_210822" name="Item_112" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-07T20:46:27+00:00" title="June  7, 2009  8:46PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: chearns</cite>I guess what I'm wondering is, why isn't that a reasonable solution for you to death in one on one games?</blockquote>\nIt is!
