I'll pop here every now and them, and read some stuff at random. So please do keep that in mind in your replies.<br/><br/>In my browsing, I've come across the terms Story Now, Story Before, Story After. I think I might be groking them instinctually, but I'm interested in having you guys explain them to me. So what do they mean? Are they a gaming goal, a type of game, what? I think I've seen the terms used as both, actually, so I'm a bit confused there.<br/><br/>Thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335041/#Comment_335041" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-18T08:17:30+00:00" title="July 18, 2011  8:17AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you're right that they can be both a style of game and a goal to strive towards (although Story Before is probably mostly pejorative in these parts, and I haven't seen it as much as the other two).<br/><br/>Story Now is the tagline for Narrativist play.  My current understanding is that the group sets up a thematically powerful premise and an unstable situation, and then plays out the resolution of that situation (which then leads to the next situation, and the next, etc, depending on how long you're playing for) without any predetermined agenda on anyone's part (usually this restriction applies especially to the GM, if there is one, but it can also be important for players with certain backgrounds to understand) about "how it's supposed to turn out."  The story of the game is what happens at the table, and it is both entertaining and thematically (or literarily, if you will) interesting.<br/><br/>It's interesting to note that many Story Now-supporting games have rules that prevent things like random and undramatic character death; contrast this with 1E D&amp;D's "go through a stack of characters until you get one who survives to 2nd level" mentality.  Those rules can help us to play honestly, without fear.<br/><br/>Story After is where the actual play may not focus on themes or moral character choices, but when all is said and done we can look back and construct a narrative based on how things turned out in the end.  That 1E D&amp;D thing is definitely a good example\u2014if my first 5 guys die, then I wasn't, in hindsight, playing anyone central to "the story" with them, but if my 6th guy survives to 2nd level and goes on to continue adventuring, then it turns out this game is actually maybe mostly his story, but we couldn't have known that at the outset.<br/><br/>Story Before, to me, means everyone puts a great deal of work into elaborate backstories for their characters, and then will focus on exploring the ramifications of that backstory in play.  I've rarely seen this done well\u2014there are numerous pitfalls, including turtling, having too many secrets for the other players to meaningfully participate in your scenes, and being unable to modify your vision of your character to fit the current circumstances.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille" title="Jocelyn Robitaille"><img alt="Jocelyn Robitaille" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille">Jocelyn Robitaille</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335043/#Comment_335043" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-18T08:29:40+00:00" title="July 18, 2011  8:29AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting.

"Address" means:\n<ul>\n<li>Establishing the issue's Explorative expressions in the game-world, "fixing" them into imaginary place.</li>\n<li>Developing the issue as a source of continued conflict, perhaps changing any number of things about it, such as which side is being taken by a given character, or providing more depth to why the antagonistic side of the issue exists at all.</li>\n<li>Resolving the issue through the decisions of the players of the protagonists, as well as various features and constraints of the circumstances.</li>\n</ul>\nCan it really be that easy? Yes, Narrativism is that easy. The Now refers to the people, during actual play, focusing their imagination to create those emotional moments of decision-making and action, and paying attention to one another as they do it. To do that, they relate to "the story" very much as authors do for novels, as playwrights do for plays, and screenwriters do for film at the creative moment or moments. Think of the Now as meaning, "in the moment," or "engaged in doing it," in terms of input and emotional feedback among one another. The Now also means "get to it," in which "it" refers to any Explorative element or combination of elements that increases the enjoyment of that issue I'm talking about.<br/><br/>There cannot be any "the story" during Narrativist play, because to have such a thing (fixed plot or pre-agreed theme) is to remove the whole point: the creative moments of addressing the issue(s). Story Now has a great deal in common with Step On Up, particularly in the social expectation to contribute, but in this case the real people's attention is directed toward one another's insights toward the issue, rather than toward strategy and guts.</blockquote>\nTo my knowledge "Story Before" and "Story After" arose as responses to Ron's decision to call the process that identifies Narrativist play "Story Now", and mean pretty much what they sound like they mean.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335049">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille" title="Jocelyn Robitaille"><img alt="Jocelyn Robitaille" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille">Jocelyn Robitaille</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335049/#Comment_335049" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-18T08:50:41+00:00" title="July 18, 2011  8:50AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So if I get the quote right, Story Now is... roleplaying?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335050">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335050/#Comment_335050" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-18T08:56:02+00:00" title="July 18, 2011  8:56AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 18, 2011 8:56AM by Graham.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Story Before: A preplanned scenario.<br/><br/>Story Now: Story which doesn't rely on a preplanned scenario.<br/><br/>Broadly speaking.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335054">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335054/#Comment_335054" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-18T08:59:46+00:00" title="July 18, 2011  8:59AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jocelyn Robitaille</cite>So if I get the quote right, Story Now is... roleplaying?</blockquote>\nIn a way, yes.

"For use" as inspiration to create other media such as 'game fiction'...  or even just prioritizing generating a good memory, over the visceral realtime enjoyment at the table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335060">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335060/#Comment_335060" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-18T09:23:47+00:00" title="July 18, 2011  9:23AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Story Now (narrativism, pretty much interchangeably) is one type of roleplaying. If it's the only kind you've ever done, then you might not recognize anything strange in its definition. The same actually might go for those who've never done anything like it: much has been written about the misleading rhetorical devices that roleplaying games use to convince the participants that their ouia board really acts on its own - that is, even the GM who preplots the game and fudges with the rules to arrive at his preplanned story often seems to think that for a given value of "creation" the story is, indeed, being created in play. "Story Now" and "narrativism" are useful terms for emphasizing it when in your game the dramatic impact of the story - the factor that makes the story interesting as a story - is genuinely created at the gaming table, as an end-result of the interaction between the players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335063">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335063/#Comment_335063" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-18T09:30:34+00:00" title="July 18, 2011  9:30AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And not just any theme.

Plenty of stories in the regular-ole-walking-around-normal-everyday definition of story just don't qualify.<br/><br/>Also, "now" doesn't mean the important question of the story isn't thought up and considered beforehand, it just means it is answered in play.  As an example, Dogs in the Vineyard's town creation takes place outside of play, before play occurs, and it's basically a road map for how the story will go as much as any other preparation anyone might make.

(Or what Ron's muse Lagos Egri called 'Premise'.)<br/><br/>Therefore,  <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Theme Now</span> would mean that <b>now</b>, at the table, is when the question inherent in the theme gets addressed.<br/>For example--  "Will you save your child or yourself?"<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Theme Before</span>:  it's foregone before play even begins that the hero will sacrifice themselves to save the child.  So if pre-planning pre-decides the answer, then it's Story Before.<br/><br/>Theme Now: during play, we find out what the hero will do.  Until then, it's an open choice.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Theme After</span>: The hero does all sorts of stuff.  Afterward, we ignore the dungeon looting and murder and selectively recall the time<br/>he sacrificed himself and declare that it was, retroactively, the defining moment which makes him a hero.<br/><br/>So Theme After may really be Theme Not At All Unless/Until Somebody Bothers To Think About It Later.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335067">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille" title="Jocelyn Robitaille"><img alt="Jocelyn Robitaille" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille">Jocelyn Robitaille</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335067/#Comment_335067" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-18T09:47:09+00:00" title="July 18, 2011  9:47AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 18, 2011 9:53AM by Jocelyn Robitaille.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Poster by Graham</cite>Also, there are plenty of games which require absolutely no prep (aside from someone knowing how to play)</blockquote>\nI have to disagree, here. I actually think this is a great mirage of story games in general and GMles games in particular: that there's no one person making decisions unilaterally about the game. Not so. The <i>designer</i> is making tons of decisions for you. Of the games you quoted, I've only tried Fiasco and read Microscope, but in those two, there are tons of base elements in the design which affect the story that will be produced. Sure, you or your friends don't have to do any prep and none of you have more weight in the story, but it doesn't mean that prep didn't take place and that some amount of Story Before (if I get the term right) hasn't been established prior to play.<br/><br/>This is sort of why I was asking about the breaking point. It's okay for the designer to shape the game prior to play. Once we've accepted that, then surely it's also okay for a GM to shape the game prior to play also, in games with a GM. So, the way I see it, this is a question of the "weight" of that shaping rather than whether it's happening or not.<br/><br/>So...<br/><br/>How heavy-handed does GM need to be in order for the potential for Story Now to die out, and for the game to fall squarely within the realm of Story Before?<br/><br/>Or, for that matter, how heavy-handed does the DESIGNER need to be in order for the potential for Story Now to die out, and for the game to fall squarely within the realm of Story Before? (Take My Life With Master, for instance... given that it's heavily pre-scripted, does it qualify as Story Now or Story Before?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille" title="Jocelyn Robitaille"><img alt="Jocelyn Robitaille" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille">Jocelyn Robitaille</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335069/#Comment_335069" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-18T09:50:08+00:00" title="July 18, 2011  9:50AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted by Todd L</cite>So Theme After may really be Theme Not At All Unless/Until Somebody Bothers To Think About It Later.</blockquote>\nInteresting.

You need both THEME + the freedom to explore that theme in a meaningful way. So, sure, if the designer or GM or other players have scripted the game too tightly, there's may be not much there to meaningfully explore.  Maybe the game just explicitly tells you that power isn't worth the cost, for example, instead of letting you explore whether it is or not.<br/><br/>Generally speaking, though, I think trying to apply these abstract labels and concepts to specific games or situations or people is not necessarily enlightening.  In practice, games are messy things, even very tightly designed ones and the play of them is even more so.  Sure, you could play a My Life With Master game that seemed fated to reach certain conclusions or you could play one that felt much more free and exploratory; it varies quite a bit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335079">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335079/#Comment_335079" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-18T10:49:54+00:00" title="July 18, 2011 10:49AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 18, 2011 11:21AM by Todd_L.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't played Microscope, so someone else will have to confirm whether Legacies are Story After.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>I do want to comment on JDCorley's assertion that the theme must be a 'moral' question:<br/><br/>I am vague on whether Egri or Ron actually insisted that the theme be a 'moral' one, in the sense of Morality (or Ethics).<br/><br/>It seems possible that Egri merely insisted that the theme <span style="text-decoration: underline;">have</span> a moral, as in 'the moral of the story'.<br/><br/>The latter type of moral can be a merely practical statement, such as "Look Before You Leap"... not dealing with morality.<br/><br/><br/>It's certainly true that many subsequent hippie gamers have asserted that 'morality' is required, not just 'a moral'.<br/><br/><br/>But defining Story Now and Narrativism that way-- ARBITRARILY limits the terms to exclude other types of stories.<br/><br/>There's no good reason why Narr techniques couldn't/shouldn't be used to play drama in all its facets, not just Morality Conundrums.<br/><br/><br/>At Camp Nerdly, I ran a playtest where the drama was about whether a loose-boweled character would make it to the outhouse,<br/>with a bear blocking the way.

Under the definition of "Story" relevant to those terms this:<br/><br/>Three guys go into a cave and slay a dragon.<br/><br/>is NOT a story.  It's not a story because there are no issues of human interaction *at stake* in the described events.  Notice: It's real easy for us to infuse that with all kinds of issues.  Do the three guys trust each other?  Why are they there to slay the dragon, etc, etc.  But look at what I actually wrote.  None of that is actually present.  The reader would have to imaginatively infuse it with those things.  And so, again, given the idea of Story those phrases were developed under what is actually written above is not a story.<br/><br/>So now looking at an instance of play, are there (a) issues of human interaction in play at all (b) are they ever *at stake* and (c) when?<br/><br/>Story Now means those issues are alive and at stake, right here, right now in play.  My Life with Master is Story Now because whether the Master dies or not is, not what's at stake.  What's at stake is, "Am I worth loving?"  Who kills, the Master and why is HUGE!  What the Master represents and where the minions choose to stand relative to it is a vast, wide open question that is live from start to finish.<br/><br/>Story Before doesn't have to be some crazy rail-road.  Many investigative scenarios or heavily lore/exploration based adventures are Story Before.  All the issues of human interaction are explored and resolved among NPCs in the scenario's back story.  The PCs are simply uncovering or revealing that information and sort-of emotively reacting to it.  There's nothing at stake, right here, right now (except perhaps some unresolved lingering danger from the back story).  "Oh, my god,100 years ago NPC Henry murdered his NPC wife because she found out about the blackmail scheme he was running on NPC Alice.  Now her ghost is running around killing people, she must be stopped!"<br/><br/>Story After is largely a psychological phenomenon much like the "reading issues of human interaction" into my sentence above about three guys killing a dragon.  After play a player might say, "It was totally important that I kill the dragon because in my backstory my parents where killed by dragons and so this was personal."  But that was never actually, a live *at stake* issue during play.  Or there might be one or two choice moments in play where perhaps there WAS a live issue of human interaction at stake in play and later we condense the game down to those key points while ignoring the hours of random encounters, shopping, and hanging around in taverns that filled up the rest of the time.<br/><br/>So if this your definition of story: "A situation which raises issues of human interaction, develops and resolves them," then it becomes clear what these terms mean.<br/><br/>If your definition of story is this: "a series of fictional events," then the phrases are a bit murky.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335085">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille" title="Jocelyn Robitaille"><img alt="Jocelyn Robitaille" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille">Jocelyn Robitaille</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335085/#Comment_335085" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-18T11:18:35+00:00" title="July 18, 2011 11:18AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 18, 2011 11:18AM by Jocelyn Robitaille.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted by Jesse</cite>Three guys go into a cave and slay a dragon.<br/><br/>is NOT a story.</blockquote>\nAgain, I'll rephrase to see if I got this right...<br/><br/>Three guys go into a cave and slay a dragon is not a story, but...<br/><br/>"Three guys go into a cave and slay a dragon if they can work together"<br/>"Three guys go into a cave and slay a dragon or else they will lose everything they hold dear"<br/>"Three guys go into a cave and slay a dragon but only one can claim the deed"<br/>"Three guys go into a cave and slay a dragon to prove their worth"<br/><br/>... all are.<br/><br/>Correct?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335088">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335088/#Comment_335088" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-18T11:23:20+00:00" title="July 18, 2011 11:23AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesse's saying some really smart things, but I'm more interested in this:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jocelyn Robitaille</cite>I can definitely see a concrete application for Story Before / Story Now / Story After... although probably not in the way they seem to be used right now.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille" title="Jocelyn Robitaille"><img alt="Jocelyn Robitaille" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille">Jocelyn Robitaille</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335089/#Comment_335089" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-18T11:28:24+00:00" title="July 18, 2011 11:28AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/J">@J</a>.

And then to distinguish Before vs Now, you have to look at whether those issues are actually really at stake in play.  A lot of Story Before can happen in a game that's totally played in the moment if what's happening socially is that the group has either explicitly or implicitly come to an agreement on how those issues will be resolved.  We all agree this is going to be a bloody tragedy where everyone dies, so we all play towards that.  That's still Story Before.  More common is something like, "there's mistrust and tension among our characters but we all know we're going to come together in the end to save the day" and we play toward that.  Also Story Before.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335095">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335095/#Comment_335095" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-18T11:41:00+00:00" title="July 18, 2011 11:41AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's okay, I've got work too <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Another thing that just struck me: part of what's necessary for Story Now is for the players to either allow the answer to the question posed by the theme to emerge from play or disagree about the answer and have that disagreement play out through character interactions.  For example, in Dogs in the Vineyard, if everybody is convinced from the beginning that the Dogs are religiously deluded murdering psychopaths, the group isn't going to really get much Story Now because they've already judged their characters in their own minds.  But sometimes it works to have one or two players doing the zealot thing if the other players are engaging with the theme and trying to make the right choices and do the best they can under dubious circumstances.  Then you get situations like: "Do you shoot your fellow Dog when they engage in something you find repulsive?" And that can actually be pretty interesting, even though the psychopath characters may seem less like protagonists and more like NPCs, because they may not have much internal tension to provide the core of the psychological "story" that Jesse mentions. They've kinda "opted out" of Story Now and become antagonists, though maybe later -- if they don't get killed -- they could become more complicated and re-engage.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335102">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille" title="Jocelyn Robitaille"><img alt="Jocelyn Robitaille" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille">Jocelyn Robitaille</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335102/#Comment_335102" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-18T12:32:05+00:00" title="July 18, 2011 12:32PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, surprisingly, I have time to go on break, so I guess I'll post my concrete application of Story Before, Now and After right now. Please keep in mind that I haven't been using the terms themselves, but the work method I'll explain here is something I've been using for a couple of years already.<br/><br/>Before I go into the method itself, here is why I think my application of Story Before / Now / After is different than how it's being presented here. From what I can grok, I think every single RPG session is made up of Story Before, Story Now, and Story After. To me, they don't seem to be opposing concepts, but rather different aspects of how a Story is made up while playing an RPG. And I really think that, when designing a scenario and most likely even a game, it's probably useful to think about what you want to be Story Before, what you want to be Story Now, and what you want to be Story After... because all three will happen in your game whether you want it or not.<br/><br/>Basically, this is a work method I developped when I was heavily into creating one-shots scenarios, which need to have a beginning, middle and end within the span of four hours. Player empowerment has always been pretty important to me as a GM, and as an end result the first one-shots I designed failed at being four hours long, because I left too much open space and the scenario never reached its end because I wasn't willing to railroad it into destination.<br/><br/>Eventually, I decided that since a 4 hour game using an RPG meant for campaign play meant using it for a much smaller span than what it was designed for, I needed to limit the span of my player empowerment as well.<br/><br/>Here is what I ended up doing. I decided on a specific area of the fiction where I wanted the players to have full control (the Story Now element), and designed the rest of the scenario super tightly on the rest of the issue (the Story Before) element. Finally, I picked the overall impression I wanted all of us to leave with, once the game was done, in order to color my scene framing in the course of play (this feels like Story After, but with foresight... or maybe not.)<br/><br/>What I discovered as I did this was that my one-shots became super tight, and even though the plot became somewhat more railroady, the players felt more empowered because for the elements they did have control over, they could go full throttle on that power without fear of breaking the story.<br/><br/>So here is how I think Story Before and Story Now (at least) can have concrete applications: by being clear that both of these will always be part of a RPG and by making sure the players are clear what parts are set in stone and what parts they'll be able to impact.<br/><br/>Then again, maybe I'm misreading the concepts... like I said, I'm slapping them over a scenario design method I already had... maybe they fit, maybe they don't.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335103/#Comment_335103" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-18T12:33:39+00:00" title="July 18, 2011 12:33PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 18, 2011 12:36PM by Valamir.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Its interesting that all these answers kind of skip over a big part of what the "Now" part means in story NOW.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs originally coined Story NOW wasn't juxtaposed with "before" or "after" but rather it was Story NOW vs. Story LATER.<br/>\n<br/>\nStory Later being all that really good stuff that the GM is going to bring to hit upon your character's plot hooks and all that...some day...eventually...if you play long enough.

As such its likely that eventually those themes will be featured in play, but when that happens, if it happens it will be incidental to play rising organically from the normal activities of playing characters in that particular game world.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Story After play there is no theme heavy premise front loaded into the scenario, nor is any time spent on driving to such during play.  Rather afterwards, typically during people's highly edited memories of that old campaign they had they'll talk as if there was some over riding theme to play but if there was it was entirely the result of events spontaneously arising during play that later can be subjectively remembered as a coherent whole.  Much the way history told in history books is edited and selected to fit within whatever the central thesis of the reporting historian is.<br/>\n<br/>\nStory Now is a distinctly different beast.  Phrases that tried to capture this play from back in the day include "Addressing Premise" and "Playing On-Purpose".  Its a hard thing to capture in words.  It doesn't require out-of-character meta-thinking, although that is certainly one of the easier ways of getting there.  Its a deliberate effort to make sure play is thematic loaded...not after the fact by rose-colored memories, and not by accident if it just happens to happen; but right now during play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335107/#Comment_335107" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-18T12:49:14+00:00" title="July 18, 2011 12:49PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">In that sense, though, I'm not so sure Story Now is better than Story Later.

If the dramatist (Egri) or player (Ron) didn't make a moral statement with his work (Egri) or play (Ron), then they weren't producing drama (Egri) or narrativism (Ron).

I look forward to that thread.<br/><br/>One of the things that can make the Forge-related body of theory off-putting to newcomers is that it's difficult to really "be a part of the conversation" because, at this point, that conversation mostly happened 5-8 years ago and very few people are still actively discussing it, especially since the theory forums on the Forge have been closed for a while now.  Most often these days, it's something that is referenced occasionally rather than a living, contentious body of thought on roleplaying.  Plus, even when it is referenced, people tend to wrack their memories and search old threads to try to figure out what was originally being talked about.<br/><br/>That being the case, it's usually better -- in my opinion -- to use it as a springboard for new discussions rather than focus too much on how it was originally intended, unless you're specifically researching the development of roleplaying theory in this community.<br/><br/>P.S. Honestly, the conversation wasn't even that easy to be a part of 5-8 years ago, but that's a seperate issue <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335121/#Comment_335121" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-18T13:36:55+00:00" title="July 18, 2011  1:36PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 18, 2011 1:46PM by Todd_L.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For what it's worth, although David Mamet is another who cites Egri in reference to Premise; <br/>Mamet's version doesn't require Morality, just a variety of options.<br/><br/>He denounces a single 'right' option as mere propaganda, a polemic, or a Morality Play.<br/>He also denounces repetition of an option that has already been answered in the story-- as un-dramatic,<br/>(but he says it is suitable for the Epic form, and for Biography-- where the same themes repeat.<br/>Which is an awesome way to reconcile the dividing line between Narr and Trad approaches to theme.<br/>Narr = drama, Trad = epic and biographical.)<br/><br/><br/>Mamet also has a contrary view of the "now" part of drama.   In his version:<br/><br/>"Captain Hook walks into a bar. The bartender looks at the hook, and says 'You should have been here yesterday, because'..."<br/><br/><br/>That's drama. <br/><br/>Because the audience is right there in the moment, in the same predicament as Captain Hook, waiting to find out why Hook should have been there yesterday.<br/><br/>This probably corresponds to immersion and 'actor stance' in rpg jargon.<br/><br/>=<br/><br/>I feel that it's best if hippiegame jargon matches usage in other areas of culture, such as Theatre, Film, Law.<br/><br/>If we have our own special secret meanings for common words, we become cultish and obscure.<br/>If our usage is compatible with other areas of culture, then we're probably on the right track (to the extent that the rest of culture is on the right track.)

I used to get characters with the concept of "I'm this measly little thing who can't do jack now, but I'll get better and after 70 sessions, I'm the king of the continent!" and applied the Story Later concept there, to character creation. This, to me, is a problem because I don't want to promise the player that his character lives for 70 sessions - I want his life to be at stake.<br/><br/>Story Before as applied to characters reminds me of forth gigantic backstories for characters who don't have that much of a story in-game, or Now.

The key is this:  re-telling or selective memory after play may impose structure, but it isn't inserting moral content that wasn't there before.  <br/><br/>There are people who generally don't want any story structuring within their RPG play, but they will say that the PCs should be able to make meaningful choices, and those choices have consequences.  Making choices and having consequences is moral content.  Such a game might then be Narrativist by Ron's definition, but it rejects the structure of story.  <br/><br/>Arguably, a story has structure and resolution mainly because it has a single authorial point-of-view.  Even if collaborated on, the collaborators will likely agree on a point to the story.  For an RPG, you have 4-8 people all putting in their moral/ethical ideas into the pot.  If everyone's view is represented, then the result might not be able to be concluded and resolved the way that a planned single-author story is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335303">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335303/#Comment_335303" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-20T06:33:21+00:00" title="July 20, 2011  6:33AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 20, 2011 6:34AM by Todd_L.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with this sentence:\n<blockquote><cite> jhkim</cite>I think there is a huge problem of the discrepancy between the common understanding of "story" as a<i>structured</i>narrative, and Ron's definition of "Story Now" purely as addressing moral issues</blockquote>\nMy agreement is based on the word 'moral' being irrelevant.   If issues appear, are confronted, and resolved-- that's structure. Beginning, middle, end.<br/>No less so if morality isn't a factor, than if it is.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite> jhkim</cite>There are people who generally don't want any story structuring within their RPG play, but they will say that the PCs should be able to make meaningful choices, and those choices have consequences.

'Story' is too vague a term.<br/><br/>Consider the Wolverine clone, whose issue is 'I'm a badass' at the beginning of the story, and in the middle, and-- there is no end in sight.  He will forever be a badass, and never grow, change, or stay dead.<br/><br/>Ron called that brain damage, viewing it as an inability to grasp what a story entails.<br/><br/>But (as I noted in post #44) David Mamet says it is a hallmark of the Epic form and the Biography, that the hero will endlessly meet challenges in a trademark way; without changing tactics or needing to do so.        So-- it's not brain damage, It's not 'broken drama'. It's just players pursuing one of Drama's close cousins-- which don't have 'ending' as a requisite part of their <span style="text-decoration: underline;">serial</span> structure.<br/><br/>Which indicates that the hallmark of Narrativism is that the stories are supposed to End.

So you have Ulysses S. Grant's first drink, his drunken expulsion from school, drunk fights with his wife, winning the Civil War without sobering up, drunken presidency, death from liver failure.  "Drunk" is the angle, the hook.  But it need not resolve.<br/><br/>In an Epic (or serial) there are an open-ended number of stories about the Drunken Master.  Each story may have an ending.  The guy may have a final story.  There may even be individual chapters where he sobers up.   But, essentially, his drunkenness is a defining trait-- a type-- rather than an Issue that gets resolved.<br/><br/><br/>It's easy for me to imagine a Vampire player saying "My guy is addicted to blood.  He has been for 500 years.  He will be 500 more."<br/><br/>And then Ron thinking, "That's gonna be a thousand boring years if he doesn't ever tackle that Addiction as an issue, rather than a Given, an unquestioned superpower."<br/><br/><br/>Ron's way is good and it works and it matches the classical understanding of Drama.    But the other way is a thing, too.  It's not merely broken. <br/>And in trad campaigns, folklore, and in our sequel-happy culture of 'media properties'... the other way is ubiquitous.<br/>It's also ubiquitous in the Biography of celebrity journalism, where the 'story' doesn't require Paris Hilton or Charlie Sheen to sober up.  They can just keep giving, by repeating their follies in endless iterations.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>(I am extrapolating a whole lot here, from about 2 sentences of Mamet.  But, I think I'm talking sense.)                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335354">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335354/#Comment_335354" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-20T10:08:36+00:00" title="July 20, 2011 10:08AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok sure, but I don't see that as being mutually exclusive.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you're playing U.S. Grant in a Nar Game the premise is simply going to be something other than his being drunk.  His being drunk is just going to be a thing...like his being human.  The "story" will be found elsewhere...perhaps (probably) colored/influenced by his drunkeness...but that's not the central thing being resolved.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not a fan of physical comedy so I haven't seen many Drunken Master movies, but I suspect there too the premise of any particular movie is going to be about something other than his being drunk as a thing in and of itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nVampire, similarly.  The premise isn't going to be be about the hunger in isolation.  Its going to be about something else...which likely intersects with the hunger but is not resolved by resolving the hunger.  See True Blood for stories about vampires that are about something other than being addicted to blood.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo Ithis distinction seems entirely artifical to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the ultimate point is the difference between life and story well, yeah.  That's a given.  Life isn't a story.  Its a series of events that occur in sequence.  But when stories get written about someones life, they're usually assembled and edited in such a way as to make them more like a story.  See most any episode of "City Confidential"...or the way reality TV episodes get edited together in an attempt to storify them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's a reason why not everyone's life gets turned into a story...cuz most of them are boring as hell.  But even for those folks whose life does get turned into a story, there are few that don't get edited in an attempt to find the drama.<br/>\n<br/>\nWanting a story and getting it by focusing on the things needed to produce a story is a fine thing.<br/>\nWanting a series of events strung together in sequence and getting it by playing out a series of events strung together in sequence is a fine thing.<br/>\nWanting story and thinking you can get by simply playing out a series of events strung together in sequence is what Ron was calling broken.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYes I realize that news journalists call what they write a "story", but to me, that's just an example of the vagaries of language when 1 word gets hung with multiple definitions.  Harry Potter and the front page of the NY Times are two very different things.  Its unfortunate that both get called "stories"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335360">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335360/#Comment_335360" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-20T10:44:42+00:00" title="July 20, 2011 10:44AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 20, 2011 10:46AM by Paul_T.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Todd,<br><br>I thought I was following along, but then...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Todd L</cite>the crucial moment is when the character either succumbs to the bottle, or overcomes it to save the maiden (or whatever).</blockquote>\nHow is this different from:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Todd L</cite>Ulysses S.

By the way, on that point, Jocelyn, I think you are incorrect to identify too much GM planning as the primary source of dysfunctional Meaning Before play.  Overplanning is certainly one source of it, but players being overly invested in a particular vision of how things must go and being unwilling to compromise their vision of their character is very common as well.  <br><br>*SotC is a great example of this.  There's stuff in the text about how Fists and Daring will generally Win the Day in this genre of fiction.  SotC, in my experience, facilitates Meaning Before, Right to Dream play really well.  Play is about reinforcing the themes in really fun and inventive ways; it's not really about challenging them.  It's not a broken or boring game at all... but I have seen players be uninterested in that sort of morally carefree play.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335375">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335375/#Comment_335375" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-20T11:22:31+00:00" title="July 20, 2011 11:22AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like that, Matt!<br><br>It's fairly clear to someone unfamiliar with the concept...

One way to interpret that observation is to note that extremely dysfunctional forms of Meaning Before are quite common (again, GM over-planning or outright railroading coupled with player turtling and over-defining backstory), and that Meaning After tends to occur sporadically if at all simply by its very nature.  Something as relatively unstructured as a truly old-school dungeon crawl may wind up not having any interesting moments to reflect on at all!  (This issue of needing a game to have frequent pivotal moments in <i>some</i> way is one of the areas where I part company from Tavis in particular and the OSR in general, precisely because I don't really have faith in Meaning After as a reliable way of generating and maintaining gamers' interest.  That doesn't mean I want to turn dungeon crawls into emo blood operas though!)  So, the problems with Meaning Before and Meaning After may make Meaning Now sound particularly attractive.<br/><br/>Eero said it more succinctly upthread, and Ben Lehman pointed this out in an important discussion once as well: many gamers have only ever experienced one functioning Creative Agenda, which they view as "roleplaying."  To that gamer, everything else sounds like it would be dysfunctional or unfun because they haven't played any games which meaningfully support another agenda.  And any time they've tried it's resulted in boring zilchplay.  (Zilchplay is defined as play that never coalesces around a particular Creative Agenda; it's an important but oft-overlooked concept.)<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335453">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335453/#Comment_335453" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-20T23:57:24+00:00" title="July 20, 2011 11:57PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Deliverator</cite>A better term, in the context of RPGs, than "Story" might actually be "Meaning."

When people tell stories about the game later, they impose a sense of order - but they don't invent out of whole cloth meaning that wasn't there.  <br/><br/>For example, if a game was solely about killing monsters, then when people tell stories about it, they don't invent moral quandries that weren't there.  They tell stories about how cool it was to defeat the dragon at the end, or the hilarious misadventures with the piercers, and so forth.  If you are only concerned about moral meaning, then this is "Meaning Never" - not Meaning Later.  <br/><br/>As I said, though, plenty of people reject the sense of story order in their games - yet still insist that player choices will affect the game and have consequences.  GMs who totally reject the idea of "story" may still say that if the PCs go around murdering townsfolk that there will be social consequences to their actions.  That is meaningful moral content to the game. right then.  What happens later isn't invention of meaning, it is imposing structure.  i.e. This is "Meaning Now + Structure Later".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335468/#Comment_335468" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-21T04:23:00+00:00" title="July 21, 2011  4:23AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt,<br/><br/>Meaning, if anything has more uses than even story.

It begins with him parsing the similarities between a huge variety of idioms-- everything from flute music, to rhythmic dancing, to academic lectures given in rhyme (!),  all provided to say that he's Not talking about this and he's Not talking about that.   Eventually, he winnows it down to saying he's talking about Drama.   There's some great stuff in there, like he makes a point of saying that it doesn't matter if you speak In Character or in your Own Voice. He allows that both are good <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Roleplaying</span> Drama.<br/><br/>He uses the word 'imitation' to refer to how stories imitate human life.  In Satire, for instance it is sufficient for the imitation to merely be a pantomime; a recognizable likeness of humanity.   Using Aristotle as a starting point, I'd say that Story Now imitates the dynamic moment of choice.   Whereas something else, like the Rapist Killers example, imitates a moment after the choice to kill rapists has been made.   See how starting from Aristotle gives us a non-beligerant way to talk about both?<br/><br/><a href="http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/poetics.1.1.html" rel="nofollow">Link to Poetics.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335473">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335473/#Comment_335473" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-21T06:02:46+00:00" title="July 21, 2011  6:02AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But Matt, if the word meaning means something different in "Meaning Now" versus "Meaning Afterward" then they need to be different words, otherwise the parallel construction is just confusing.

I still think that your description of Meaning Later doesn't fit, though.  After the game, people do tell stories about cool stuff - but that cool stuff <i>actually happened during the game</i>.  The process that happens afterwards isn't coming up with cool stuff, it is structuring and editing the narrative of what happened to have a point.  Hence, "Meaning Now + Structure Later".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335508">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335508/#Comment_335508" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-21T11:04:40+00:00" title="July 21, 2011 11:04AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 21, 2011 12:15PM by Todd_L.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Aristotle, <i>Poetics</i>, Part V:<br/><br/><i>"Tragedy endeavors, as far as possible, to confine itself to a single revolution of the sun, or but slightly to exceed this limit, whereas the Epic action has no limits of time.

Yup, I was speaking too loosely.<br/><br/>But-- let's look at what makes a Narr ending.  How do we know when a Narr story is over?<br/><br/>Well, for Narr, we need there to be an active (dynamic) moment of thematic choice.<br/><br/>For example, in 'The Third Man', Orson Welles has committed murder.  Joseph Cotten plays his best friend.<br/>Will Cotten choose friendship or justice?  Will he help the police catch his best friend?<br/><br/>In Narr, the story is over when Cotten decisively makes his choice.<br/><br/>Mamet says a dramatic ending is both "surprising" and "inevitable".<br/><br/>Throughout the movie Cotten is steadfastly loyal to Welles.  Time and again the loyalty is challenged.  Each time, there's less &amp; less good reason to be loyal.  When Cotten finally betrays Welles it's a surprising change, but inevitable-- because every choice has a breaking point, or else it's no choice at all.<br/><br/>Mamet atributes the "surprising and inevitable" formulation to Aristotle, but says Aristotle used very different words:<br/>"pity and fear".  Pity because the audience sees the tragic protagonist reaching the surprising point of failure. And fear, because the audience identifies with how we-too might reach that tragic low point.<br/><br/>The reason I'm posting all this, is I just got to the part of poetics where Aristotle mentions fear &amp; pity:<br/><br/>Part VI<br/>"Tragedy, then, is an imitation of an action that is serious, complete, and of a certain magnitude; in language embellished with each kind of artistic ornament, the several kinds being found in separate parts of the play; in the form of action, not of narrative; through pity and fear effecting the proper purgation of these emotions."<br/><br/> It's funny that Aristotle says the basis of Tragedy is "action" and specifically-not "narrative".  <br/>Oops-- so-much for the term Narrativism!    Guess what Drama means in Greek: "To Act".   Oh well.<br/><br/>What does Aristotle mean by "narrative"?  According to Mamet, "narrative" is a dirty word.  Narrative is force-feeding theme to the protagonist*.  Such as putting him in a thematic position with only one sane choice:<br/>Narrative is Railroading!<br/><br/>Drama is putting the protagonist in a quandry, where he has a dynamic choice of action; and watching to see which he'll do.   Drama is Story Now.<br/><br/><br/>(*And, to digress once-again into Epic and Biography, aren't those idioms where the the theme-- is a static thesis, to be hammered-away at ad nauseum.  Such as "Grant was a drunk!" or "Hercules sure was strong!"   In such cases, any ending is determined subjectively.  It comes when the author runs out of bullet points with-which to Narrate the thesis. Aristotle says "Epic action has no limits of time".)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14732/story-whenever-explain-em-to-me" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14732/story-whenever-explain-em-to-me" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14732/story-whenever-explain-em-to-me/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F14732%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F14732%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
