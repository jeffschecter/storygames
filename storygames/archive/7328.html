Their discussion will spark further and more specific plot points in your campaign design as well.<br/><br/>I've gotten some mileage out of saying things like "Everyone has Status 2 - no more, no less." and explaining why that's a flag for what I want out of them and what they can expect out of me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_162999">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162999/#Comment_162999" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-18T11:06:02+00:00" title="August 18, 2008 11:06AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So apparently no one things I have any reason at all to be scared to run <i>My Life with Master</i> and that there is no useful advice to offer someone running it for the first time.

It takes a certain amount of ego to present something and say "Look what I did! Behold its awesomeness!" This is why, so often, the primary hallmark of the great artist is not talent, but chutzpah. So it's no wonder you're anxious.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you run these games for the first time, you will probably do something incorrectly, as far as the rules are concerned. However, if you and your players are having a good time, that doesn't much matter. You may notice it afterwards and maybe make things even better by doing it more correctly next time. Or you may find that you and your players like it better the way you did it, and leave it that way. The truth of the matter is that most of the enjoyment of playing any game is interacting with the other players (thank you Robin Laws for pointing this out).<br/>\n<br/>\nI sometimes have anxiety fits at the prospect of running the roleplaying game I designed myself. No one knows the rules better than I, and yet I don't always run the game correctly. But my players almost always seem to enjoy themselves anyway. And for me, that's the whole point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_163145">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163145/#Comment_163145" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-18T22:39:37+00:00" title="August 18, 2008 10:39PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            PTA -- the hard part is the pitch session.

I think the key thing, and its not that well explained in the text, is to remember that although the *really bad* Faeries are the Antagonists, and offstage, that most Faerie story type creatures (pookas, ogres, things under bridges, undines, imps etc.) are the player characters and they are really, really, not human. In many ways they are far less human than Vampires and the like, because their minds have been so twisted and broken by their experiences that they really don't know what is truth and what is fiction any more. <br/><br/>A Changeling on low-clarity can't tell the difference between visions, the unreality of the hedge, and the normal world. They are like a paranoid schizophrenic, except the voices can beat them up and make them kidnap children to sell them to the goblins for better dreams ... even one on high clarity still isn't always clear on what is real or not, and their system of morality, such as it is, bears little relation to normal human morality (e.g. killing someone is far better than locking them up). I'd run tabletop Changeling with a constant eye on that dreamlike unreality, and bearing in minds that the normal PCs are creepy monsters out of grimm's tales.<br/><br/>If you can (and this may be my preference of course), I'd also avoid the pseudo-medieval pageantry of the courts to some degree. It's easy to turn the whole thing into a politics game (like Nobilis where no one ever goes outside), that misses the fact that its quite a bleak horror setting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_164651">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Meserach" title="Meserach"><img alt="Meserach" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Meserach">Meserach</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164651/#Comment_164651" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-23T16:52:14+00:00" title="August 23, 2008  4:52PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: hoog</cite><cite>Posted By: fnord3125</cite><cite>Posted By: hoog</cite>also make sure you understand how More Than Human and Less Than Human apply (basically: yes, you succeed automatically, but no, you don't get out of the scene without a roll)</blockquote>Really?

Sometimes nothing happens that's worthy of a roll, you know? just play the characters doing there thing, cut form character to character whenever seems appropriate, and roll when being commanded, committing violence or villainy, or making an overture - but don't force those things to happen outside of the fiction. They should flow naturally FROM the fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166079">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166079/#Comment_166079" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-29T08:52:43+00:00" title="August 29, 2008  8:52AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "more than human", "less than human"...  at doing something. Meaning: a TASK.<br/><br/>The rolls in MLWM are all about CONFLICTS. The tasks you do to win are only pre-roll and post-roll narration.<br/><br/>Do you want to do steal something in a house, and you are "more than human" in the way you can turn invisible, inaudible, enter anyplace, steal anything, if there isn't a cat around?<br/><br/>Well, if you want to do villainy (steal from that house) you still have to roll for the conflict (villainy). If you win the roll, you narrate what you do to steal. You can even use your "more than human" ability if you want.<br/><br/>If you lose the roll... inside the house there is a cat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
