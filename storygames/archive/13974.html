GMing by improvisation is a skill I am still learning, and whilst the session before was good, this session was not.  There were factors - circumstances conspired to rob me of any time to prep the session, even by refreshing myself about my notes, so I went in cold.  Plus I was kinda tapped out from being in meetings all day at work. <br/><br/>Now I know about the concept of bangs.  I was sitting there thinking, hmm, what I need to do right now is drop a bang on these guys.  But what?  I couldnt think of anything that wouldnt seem lame and contrived.  I tried writing down a list of the unanswered questions that had been raised by play so far, and stared  at it for a while, whilst the players talked about non-game stuff.  I couldnt think of anything coherent to answer those questions right then on the spot.<br/><br/>Still, I feel that there must be some kind of best practices that a an improvising GM can fall back on in these situations.   What are your thoughts?  What do you successful improvising GMs do when you you come to the realization that you have absolutely no idea what happens next?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_316604">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316604/#Comment_316604" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-14T15:44:06+00:00" title="March 14, 2011  3:44PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I did post this same message to the forge, and I got some answers that I think are helpful and that I agree with.

One thing I really have to clamp down on is critically judging other players input about what they think should work.  I do that too much.  For example, if when faced with an impasse, a player comes up with a method to solve it that I think is dubious or even ridiculous, my inclination is just to say 'nah, that wouldnt work' or in some way hose it with NPC reactions to the proposal.   Obviously the player didnt think it was ridiculous, or they wouldnt have proposed it.  And after I hose it, where are we?  Still at an impasse, and possibly with a disgruntled player to some degree or other.  I have to switch my thinking into 'looking for ways this can work'  instead of 'looking for reasons why it wouldnt'.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_316628">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316628/#Comment_316628" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-14T17:21:31+00:00" title="March 14, 2011  5:21PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: bottlesorter</cite>Hi there.<br/><br/>The consistent tool that we have had a lot of success with is a book called Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable (ref: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Brewers-Dictionary-Phrase-Fable-18th/dp/0550104119/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1300144684&amp;sr=8-1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.amazon.com/Brewers-Dictionary-Phrase-Fable-18th/dp/0550104119/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1300144684&amp;sr=8-1</a>)<br/><br/>This is not really either a dictionary or an encyclopedia.

You might be wrong about that, after all, and that would be a pleasant thing to discover.  Or maybe they really ARE lame and contrived, I don't know, but at least it's something for everyone else at the table to play off of, and one of them might have a really clever way to use or subvert that lame and contrived idea and make everyone happy.  Either way, at least something's happening, and that's better than nothing.<br/><br/>I'll also agree with "prep some stuff" as a useful thing to do.  You know all those minutes during your typical day when you're just daydreaming or thinking about whatever?  Those are perfect time to think about your games.  Daydream about situations and conversations and characters.  Play out little scenarios in your head, think about things you'd like to try, characters you'd like to portray, themes you'd like to explore.  And then write down your best material in a little notebook or a set of index cards you carry with you, so that you can glance through it in your off-hours and think about how you can use and improve upon those ideas.  Then when you get stuck on game night, you can take a beat to flip through your little commonplace book and see if you've already got something nifty you could tailor for whatever scene you're playing.  (This works great for players, too!)<br/><br/>Worst case scenario:  take a break, for however long you need.  The advantage of improv at the game table is that you don't have to be "on" all the time, you can pause right in the middle of a scene for however long you want, and maybe without the pressure to do something RIGHT NOW your brain might unfreeze.  And if the well has genuinely run dry, just call it a night and pick it up again another day after you've had some time to mull things over.  Your friends will understand, they've almost certainly been there themselves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_316638">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy" title="Fuseboy"><img alt="Fuseboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/294/n454M25FRHU6K.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy">Fuseboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316638/#Comment_316638" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-14T18:26:55+00:00" title="March 14, 2011  6:26PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This reminds me of the idea of improv skill, "<a href="http://greenlightwiki.com/improv/Commit" rel="nofollow">commit</a>".

However, when the action stalled he looked at me and said, 'I have a good idea,' and then expected me to tell him what the good idea his character had to help put the action back on track.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_316664">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316664/#Comment_316664" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-15T02:21:54+00:00" title="March 15, 2011  2:21AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It doesn't happen often that I completely dry up but if it does I go to the toilet and have a browse through the books, mostly trivia and so very good for ideas.

Sometimes the best thing you can do is put the pcs in a boring scene, and let them have control of it. Example: The party retreated to a resting spot and is taking a break. While they're on break, pcs will either talking with each other and have character development, or they'll think of something that they want the pcs to check on. If they're talking with each other, you have a moment to take a breather, and think of the most obvious thing to happen next. If the pcs are checking on things, a lot of times this can create an opening for the GM. <br/><br/>The only thing about this is that sometimes pcs will try to cruise through a boring scene and not let the GM breath. If that happens, try to ask some questions about the boring scene and that character. Example questions: What's on your character's mind right now? What is your character most worried about? Did your character wait until he was fully healed to start preparing for the next fight, or was he really impatient? <br/><br/>Though, it also helps to warn your players before game that you're kind of tired, they'll usually cut you some slack.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_316752">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316752/#Comment_316752" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-15T17:01:44+00:00" title="March 15, 2011  5:01PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "What's on your character's mind right now?"   yes, I like this one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_316753">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316753/#Comment_316753" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-15T17:04:34+00:00" title="March 15, 2011  5:04PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>A suggestion I haven't heard yet is: stop the game for an hour or so and do something else, watch a TV show, yack about nothing, play cribbage.

Turn that little tic into a full-blown freakout. Turn a minor attraction into an obsession. Turn an awkward moment of silence into never speaking again.

And I have no idea, what will happen, who are the guys behind the names (Fraulein Eva can be a femme fatale, a damsel in distress, a leather-suited strzyga from Shock Squadrons). I give my players a starting situation - a pub, an office of Director of Operations, a shootout on a blimp spiraling to its death in a jungle full of dinosaurs. Then the gear catches, engine starts running - the game is on. Throw in your NPCs, your place - and wait for them to react. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs John said - you need plethora of characters, know them well and use them. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, know the options for how to progress with the plot. Give them (the players) a fabular knot to resolve - they will run the whole "plot inventing" thing for you (they probably know what they need far better than you do).<br/>\nI strongly advice Vladimir Propp's "Morphology of the Folktale" - it's a brilliant structural analysis of a "magical tale" - with all the functions and plot possibilities uncoverd. I'm quite sure all my games could be deconstructed with Propp's tool. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd we have "the secret rule for GM" in our game. It's a steampunk-fantasy thing with a lot of pulp action in it. So, it goes like this: Each time you don't know what to do with your story, let the HUGE steam-powered golem run through the wall and ablaze characters with the gatling fire! If you need to know - this rule always works :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nl.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_316902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316902/#Comment_316902" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-16T22:28:40+00:00" title="March 16, 2011 10:28PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 16, 2011 10:29PM by stefoid.">edited March 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The start of the folklore morphology has a reference to establishing the hero in his environment before the weirdness starts.  That reminds me:  'play unsafe' also mentions that factor which it calls 'platforms and tilts'.  This is supposed to be for dramatic effect when the weirdness/trouble starts.  <br/><br/>If memory serves, the 'boring' platform establishment stage is supposed to be useful thinking time.  The point of this thread is when you cant think of the tilt.  So it could be that going through the process of establishing the boring environment will give cues to what can be fucked with to cause the tilt.<br/><br/>Previously I was of the opinion that things like travel between locations was best immediately skipped over in a 'and you arrive in ...' fashion.  But maybe those sorts of situations do deserve to be dwelt on to some degree.  Like 'the trip is going to take X amount of time, how do you spend it?' etc....  could be good for character development?<br/><br/>Ingenero has a story phase distinct from the challenge phase for precisely those types of situations, but maybe Im not making full use of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_324076">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324076/#Comment_324076" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-12T07:45:12+00:00" title="May 12, 2011  7:45AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>As if I was a player, really.

In between sessions, here is the only "session prep" he does (aside from reviewing the characters etc):<br/><br/>1) Look at all my NPCs.<br/>2) Review what they want to happen (their goal(s)).<br/>3) Determine the next step that they will take to make that happen.<br/><br/>And that's it. The stories practically write themselves at that point.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324081">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324081/#Comment_324081" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-12T08:14:08+00:00" title="May 12, 2011  8:14AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Back when I was running a sandbox supers campaign, I always kept a stack of index cards with complications on them (hunted, addicted, dependent NPCs, etc.)  I also had a few blanks in there for when the improv moment did strike.  Toss in a few plot points, red herrings, and random crimes and I could roll with just about anything the players could throw at me.
