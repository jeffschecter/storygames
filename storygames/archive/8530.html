What about combat? I mean, do you want to have some separate resolution system "frame" in your game for fight scenes only, or not?<br/><br/>If you want to "feature" evolving weapons in your game, I advise you to go for the former, and to make the combat subsystem, like, <i>all about the weapons</i>.<br/><br/>What about your weapon being the "grid" in which you "place" your dice for combat resolution? That is, your choice of weapon shapes the fictional circumstances of the battle scenes you get into.<br/><br/>Or, what about your weapon estabilishing you "stats" dice? (You made it clear enough that skills and classes are player defined, and that's part of the "point" of the game... but what about <b>stats</b>? They sit there in your resolution system almost like a legacy... What about having "weapon stats" instead of "character stats", uh?)<br/><br/>And, to nail the "evolving" thing in place, I suggest that characters per se do <b>change </b>over time, but don't grow "more powerful" (such as: experience is represented by moving points or dice from trait to trait, but the overall total remains the same), while the <b>weapons</b>, those <b>do </b>accumulate XPs, level up and become more powerful!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189069/#Comment_189069" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-19T15:33:14+00:00" title="January 19, 2009  3:33PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: bunnybunny</cite>There is no separate combat subsystem, and I don't suppose there's much place for such, given that standard action resolution is complex enough.</blockquote>\nAlright. But, why are <b>weapons </b>"important enough to be represented mechanically" in a game where <b>combat </b>is not focal enough as to warrant exceptional resolution mechanics? What are these "evolving weapons" <i>about</i>? What are <i>you </i>trying to express through such weapons?<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: bunnybunny</cite>Stats - now, that could work. The two options for Stats I've been considering was to make them all about personality, as in the initial version of the game, or to drop that and simply go for more straightforward stuff like Strength, Dexterity etc. I'm not sure how to make Stats all about weapons, though, in a way that would make sense. I guess I could go with Stats like Sharp or the like, but I'd need a few that would describe people and weapons equally well and still applied to every adventure situation.</blockquote>\nI suggest there are "Stats" of 2 kinds (equal and interchangeable as far as resolution mechanics are concerned, but different in how they're determined and what they represent).<br/><br/>Characters only have personality-related Stats - useful for resolving social conflicts, "internal" conflicts, whatever, but those are not quite about physically shaping the material world. Maybe a Stat such as "Resolve" or "Daring" helps you in a swordfight or in keeping a damaged airship from crashing into the ground... but is not the only or even the best tool for the job.<br/><br/>"Traditional" stats such as Physical Power, Speed or Magical Power belong instead to a character's signature Weapon (making "Weapon" a section of your character sheet, first and foremost). Having "magical" stuff tied to the weapon, as the weapon is somehow linked to a warrior's soul, strikes me as appropriate to the milieu of FF-ish games, and also paves the way to multiple Weapon-stats representing separate metaphysical aspects.<br/>These are the stats you call upon to get things done in the material world positively, not confined in the personal or social sphere: to take down the gate of a fortress or to jump past a massed army to get to their head.<br/><br/>Since you call upon two Stats by default when rolling dice, a possible rule is: whenever the stakes or scope of the conflict at hand involve affecting direct change to the material world, you have to use a Stat from your Weapon (at least, or possibly both).<br/><br/>Additional mechanical difference between "Personality" and "Weapon" stats should be provided via advancement rules: character and weapons being improved in a radically different fashion, crunch-wise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189569/#Comment_189569" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-22T10:30:41+00:00" title="January 22, 2009 10:30AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Glad I helped - somehow.  ^__^                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
