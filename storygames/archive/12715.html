In the meantime, I went to Morocco, got the sh*ts and fled to Spain, watched a fine blues trio in Madrid, came back to Ireland and got new filling at the dentist. Really exciting stuff.<br/><br/>All that excitement ended this morning as I slotted books into envelopes and trusted their "do not bend" packaging to hands of the wilful post cohorts. That is to say, pre-order time for Hell for Leather is over. Anyone who'd like to play the game before they buy it can get the <a href="http://cobwebgames.com/downloads/PDFs/HfL_FREE_Edition.zip" rel="nofollow">PDF for free </a>. Or else they could see the info page for a <a href="http://cobwebgames.com/index.php/games/hell-for-leather/" rel="nofollow">brief overview</a>. Or both. I hope you like it.<br/><br/>Sebastian.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
