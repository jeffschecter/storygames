I will post more as time allows. Time may not allow very much.<br/><br/>Modifications to Moldvayan D&amp;D for use with The Long Stairs.<br/><br/>You all play Agents of your government, infiltrating the vast dungeons underneath the earth.<br/><br/>To start with, there is one class: Agent. Agents are basically fighters: d8 hit die, etc.<br/><br/>Instead of GP, you have Funding. Same points, though. Suffice it to say that, to start with, yours is not a well-funded organization.<br/><br/>Armor:<br/>Light body (think FBI agent) armor replaces leather<br/>Heavy body (think modern soldiers) armor replaces chain<br/>Full-on riot gear replaces plate.<br/>Shields are like, big, awesome riot shields.<br/><br/>Weapons:<br/>Rifles do 2d6, Pistols do 2d4 both cost 40 resources<br/>Rifles can't be used in melee range, otherwise use longbow range<br/>Pistols use sling range.<br/><br/>Automatic weapons take two attacks a round, and don't work below level 1 of the dungeon. Extra 20 resources<br/><br/>If it's high-tech bullets it's 2d8, 2d6 (not compatible with full auto, sorry) and doesn't work below level 1 of the dungeon. Extra 10 resources<br/><br/>Grenades do 1d10 damage to everything in blast radius, and don't work below level 2. cost 10 resources.<br/><br/>Firearms of any sort at all don't work below level 3 of the dungeon.<br/><br/>Don't get too attached, bucko.<br/><br/>Modern versions of knives, swords, etc are basically the same as in the book. You're lucky I don't ding a die of damage, given how crappy our modern melee weapons are.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/>You can have any fancy high-tech equipment you want. It costs 10 resources unless the DM says otherwise.<br/>If it's super-high tech, it doesn't work in the dungeon.<br/>If it's high-tech, it doesn't work below level 2.<br/>If it's only moderately tech-ish, it doesn't work below level 3.<br/>If it's basically got no moving parts at all, and the DM doesn't see any reason why it should stop working, it can keep working. It could stop at any time, though.<br/><br/>Next: Agent infections, which allow for branching out into new classes:                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215299">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21" title="Ken Sentowski!"><img alt="Ken Sentowski!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21">Ken Sentowski!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215299/#Comment_215299" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-30T07:58:55+00:00" title="June 30, 2009  7:58AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Ben, if you are going old skool with this, why not just co-opt Top Secret.

Write that shit up. Or just leave it as it is: I think we can all work out the details. I had something different that I was planning on doing w/ classes. Here's a thing I posted on RPGnet:<br/><br/>Here's a brief note on Infection, with one example, before I go to bed.<br/><br/>D-Type Infection.<br/><br/>The D-Type infection seems to reshape the agent's body to adapt to the circumstances of an underground environment. It is unknown whether the DTIA (D-Type Infection Agent) is simply adapting the agent's body to it's present surroundings, and different surroundings would produce different results, or whether it is a specific adaption Downstairs.<br/><br/>D-type infections are transmitted via fungal spores, which generally land on food or water. An agent exposed to a D-type infection must make a saving throw vs. disease or become infected. They may choose to forgo this saving throw.<br/><br/>To sustain a D-type infection, the Agent must have a Strength and Constitution score above 9. Those with lower scores are killed, painfully, by the infection over a period of a week. A cure disease spell can treat this.<br/><br/>Agents with a D type infection find themselves rapidly increasing in muscle density while at the same time decreasing in stature as their bones compress themselves to be more tight and hardy. They begin to obtain night vision, and their compact bodies can sustain more damage (+1 hp / level, now they use d10 hit dice). They also obtain preternatural sense about underground environments. (Gain all abilities of the Dwarf table)<br/><br/>Agents with a D-type infection use the Dwarf experience table to advance, although they do not lose levels upon obtaining the infection. They do not gain any of the benefits of the infection until the reach the next level of experience. During this time, the infection is running its course through their body, and has not "fixed." At the DM's discretion, these abilities may surface from time to time.<br/><br/>For example: If a level 3 Agent were to become infected with a D-type infection, they would remain a level 3 Agent until they reached level 4 on the dwarf experience table, at which point they would gain the benefits of the D-type infected class.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215355">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215355/#Comment_215355" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-30T09:25:49+00:00" title="June 30, 2009  9:25AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice.
