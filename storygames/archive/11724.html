The concept may have been "too weird" for a then-fledgling novelist, but O man would it make a kick-ass campaign:\n<blockquote>I'm going to cross the streams of The IPCRESS File and Heart of Darkness in a universe where the first world war ended in 1919 with allied tanks sitting in the wreckage of Berlin, and the decaying British empire went on to invent fascism in the 1940s. It's 1962, and two OSS agents are injected into British-dominated Europe to trace the underground railroad that is funneling abducted/brainwashed American scientists east. Our two spooks, "Wild" Bill Burroughs and his swivel-eyed Californian sidekick Philip K., follow the trail \u2014 by way of a sleazy S&amp;M nightclub in Hamburg presided over by ageing queen Adi and his boyfriend Rudi Hess \u2014 to Ceylon, where in the guts of a hollowed-out mountain they confront the jackbooted, monocle-wearing Air Commodore Arthur Clarke and his program to build an atom-bomb powered space dreadnought.</blockquote>\nI just realized that I've now wrecked it by giving away the plot, so you'll have to find players who don't read this site <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Plus, if the players are any good they'll certainly hijack the story into entirely unexpected directions, which is of course awesome, although it would be a shame not to be able to play a Fascist Arthur C. Clarke as an NPC archivillain. There are so many other possibilities, of course \u2014 like the young Jim Ballard, a sadistic doctor who stages car crashes for fun and wants to destroy the world in a holocaust of either water or wind (he can't make up his mind...) Oops, I gave away that idea too.<br/><br/>Please run this. It's too ambitious for me (I'm a total newb at GM'ing) but someone must do this idea justice (or bring it to justice...)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261653/#Comment_261653" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-12T09:52:28+00:00" title="March 12, 2010  9:52AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Charles Stross is also a role-player and sometimes-designer (credits include the original Fiend Folio's githyanki, githzerai, slaad, and death knights -- i.e., some of the coolest monsters ever).

I think the Minutia system would work just great. Since I'm not a huge fan of the genre (much as I liked Agent of Byzantium and Years of Rice and Salt), it just doesn't come up much for me. I'd love to hear someone else's opinion on how it goes, though.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
