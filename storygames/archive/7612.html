I was particularly interested in the skill challenges system, but I wasn't happy with how things turned out, probably much due to my own bad reading of the players' energy and motivation.</p>\n<p>I started with the cliched-but-heartfelt "meet someone in a bar who asks you to do a job" opening scene. After a bit of light roleplay (lightly interrogating the noble woman who's sending them on this quest), the group starts discussing next steps ("we should try to find this guy, talk to these people, maybe see who knows about the macguffin!")</p>\n<p>I interrupted this chatter, and briefly outlined things: this was an example of a skill challenge, everyone could participate, some skills "counted" while others were just for "assistance", they needed N successes (on skills that count) before X failures or they would "lose" the challenge -- while that wouldn't end the adventure, it would lead to a fight or other negative thing.</p>\n<p>This kinda destroyed the otherwise initially positive mood at the table. I made a few mistakes in setting up the challenge -- for example, tying skills to what "made sense", rather than pegging them to things the pregenerated characters were already good at, which meant that it was slightly more difficult than I'd intended. But, judging from chatter among the players (and one, who seemed to completely sign-off at this point), I think something else was amiss.</p>\n<p>Essentially, the set-up -- and past experiences with this kind of thing -- suggested an open-ended skill romp. The players thought we were playing "hide the clue" -- I know I've played this before in other games -- where they stumble through all manner of "likely" strategies until the GM dispenses the next plot point. Moving to a model where outright failure was an option (nebulously defined though it may be) came across as a big energy drain.</p>\n<p>To make matters worse, they had a terrible run of dice luck. I've never seen so many sub-five roles on so many 20-sided die. The skill challenge system seems to give even skills PCs about a 50-50 chance of success, as first-level characters, most of the variance is in the die roll. More frustration seemed to set in when they realized that the system didn't give them many resources to mitigate this string of failure. They were asking if they could use action points to for roll bonuses (this was how it worked in the previous game) or if there were any items that gave bonuses, etc. (They didn't make the most of the "aid another PC" mechanics, but I think that the run of bad luck had them underestimating their odds of success.)</p>\n<p>I pushed them to continue, and eventually we moved on to the rest of the story (and fun was had, etc.) but for many in the group, this put a cloud over the evening. I'll probably be more cautious about skill challenges in the future -- I'll certainly pay more attention to tuning the challenge to the skills the PCs possess, but that makes it rather unlikely that I'd be able to make one up as I went.</p>\n<p>I'm curious how others' experiences have gone? How did you introduce the system, and transition from table chatter to running the skill challenge?</p>\n<p>-- Joshua</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_169081">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Georgios" title="Georgios"><img alt="Georgios" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Georgios">Georgios</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169081/#Comment_169081" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-15T09:44:24+00:00" title="September 15, 2008  9:44AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Skill Challenges strike me as a tool for GM preperation for the most part. It's basically there to stat out the situation the players deal with before the game, much like you would stat out an NPC. I don't really see the point of announcing a skill challenge, the primary or secondary skills (which is something a GM I played with did) or even disclosing the rules used in one.<br/><br/>You just describe the situation like you always do, maybe drawing more attention to what the characters perceive as opportunities to act on. But instead of coming up with DCs for what the players try to do on the fly or using GM fiat to determine when the players have failed or succeeded, you have all that written down in your notes. This way you can focus on colourful descriptions and acting out NPCs, and have less to worry about picking the right numbers, coming up with consequences for success or failure or figuring out how much XP it's all worth.<br/><br/>(BTW, are you using the errata'd Skill Challenge rules? The new DCs in particular allow non-optimized characters to contribute instead of having to constantly fall back on their one maxed out skill.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_169083">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169083/#Comment_169083" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-15T09:56:34+00:00" title="September 15, 2008  9:56AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Georgios, yes.  That's the way I'd do it to.<br/>\n<br/>\nSkill Checks are like trails of bread crumbs.  Make a roll and then narrate something related to the task at hand that either moves the party closer to the ultimate goal (on a success) or introduces a new obstacle or an interesting tangential twist (on a failure).  Each roll is like discovering another breadcrumb...but one 40% made up, 40% influenced by the skill roll used and player description of what they're doing, and 20% by some seed ideas the DM came up with in prep.<br/>\n<br/>\nCollect enough breadcrumbs and you wind up at your destination.  Successful breadcrumbs means (in this case) finding the guy you were looking for.  Failure breadcrumbs means finding...something else equally fun, but potentially more dangerous (like drawing the attention of some big bad who's also looking for the MacGuffin).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I'd keep all the rest (what's secondary, what skills have special bonus rules, how many of each you need) behind the screen.  Not for DM illusionist/fudging reasons...but because those things totally aren't entertaining.  All the skills and powers and kewl fighty stuff is entertaining and thus players should be encouraged to engage with that stuff.  The Skill Challege (mechanically) is dry and boring and not at all fun...so don't make the players suffer through it.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust let them talk and when they say something that ties into the Skill Challenge, call for a roll and narrate something fun and keep track of how close they are to getting where they need to be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_169086">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169086/#Comment_169086" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-15T09:59:07+00:00" title="September 15, 2008  9:59AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've used skill challenges a fair bit in my D&amp;D 4e games.<br><br>First off, are you applying the <a href="http://wizards.com/dnd/files/UpdateDMG.pdf" rel="nofollow">corrections to the Dungeon Master's Guide</a>? The skill challenges, as printed, are broken and tend to make groups fail way too often. The errata are supposed to fix the math that creates the rampant failure, but I haven't tested them.<br><br>Second, I started using a <a href="http://transit.legendary.org/index.php/Skill_Challenges" rel="nofollow">modified system</a>, created by Stalker0 on ENWorld. His system also fixes the broken math. In addition, it adds some drama to the game with rules for "guiding light," "heroic surge," "bold recovery," and "time of trials." I tested it in my last game and it was a lot of fun. We even had a bold recovery, which made the challenge (a court trial accusing the PCs of stealing a day of time from the universe) very exciting.<br><br>In general, I tend to play very loose with which skills are "appropriate" for the encounter. I may determine a list of appropriate skills before the challenge, but if a player comes up with something clever, I allow it as a main check. <br><br>Take a look at my <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=6929" rel="nofollow">report about my "The Scryer" games</a>, where I did "police procedural" play in D&amp;D. These made strong use of the skill challenge system and, at the time, I was using the one in the DMG as written and I had no problems with it, though the players did use <i>aid another</i> fairly often.<br/><br/>The "table chatter" you refer to -- is it fun for the players? Is it fun for them but not you? If so, can you get involved and make it fun for you? Because this, to me, is an important part of role-playing. It isn't the stuff you do between "real" role-playing. As long as it's about the game (and it sounds like it was), and the players are having a good time, why stop it? Yeah, you can gently prod them to get to the mechanics with a polite, "Ready to roll some dice?" <br/><br/>When they're talking about how they're going to find the guy or talk to people, you can suggest how that translates into a roll. "You want to talk to some people to find the guy? Are you using Diplomacy for that? Maybe Intimidation?" Better, transition to a scene where they're doing what they're table-talking about. "Okay, so you are out in the alleys, talking to some really seedy people and asking about the guy. One of them is this older woman who looks like she wants to gut you with a dagger. She knows something, but she isn't talking. How do you convince her to give you the information?" Maybe it's a Diplomacy check. Maybe Intimidation or Insight. Maybe they have some other idea. Maybe you fight a combat instead and a win gives a success. The important thing is that you went from fun table-talk to REALLY fun role-play and combat. Woot!<br/><br/>I'm gonna flag something you said: "eventually we moved on to the rest of the story." Whose story? What do you mean there? How does this relate to your feeling that the game was stalled in table-talk?<br/><br/>Whiffing (rolling bad and feeling like a doofus) can be a problem in D&amp;D. I have handled that with great success using what I call Blood Tokens. Every time a player fails a d20 roll, they get a blood token (I have red glass beads). They can cash these in (all of them, not just a few at a time) for +2 for each token they turn in. They can do this after they fail a roll, if they want. This makes missing kinda fun. "I swing and -- crap -- miss. But I take a blood token. I'm getting angry. I swing again. Crap, another miss! I'm turning in my 4 tokens for a +8. Fuck you, elf. My frustration turns into pure black vengeance. Die!"                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_169104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rustin" title="Rustin"><img alt="Rustin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rustin">Rustin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169104/#Comment_169104" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-15T11:07:10+00:00" title="September 15, 2008 11:07AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I first used a skill challenge to drive them through a dungeon.

For my group thus far, I've found that 4E is definitely more about group play, but that includes letting people shine. I've been playing a Wizard in a by-the-book run of Keep on the Shadwofell (moving to something homebrewed next), and I think most of our characters have had at least one "We couldn't have done it without you" moment. For my Wizard, it's mostly been when I manage to figure out just the right spot to drop a Flaming Sphere. For the Warlord it's been when a cunning use of abilities suddenly changes the situation from "we're flanked" to "they're flanked" in a single turn. The Rogue's shining moments tend to build on the Warlord's, but it's clear nobody else could have done what the rogue did, damage-wise. Maybe my group has different expectations, but I've found 4E combat to be a great mix of teamwork and shining moments.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_169121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rustin" title="Rustin"><img alt="Rustin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rustin">Rustin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169121/#Comment_169121" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-15T11:40:01+00:00" title="September 15, 2008 11:40AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 15, 2008 11:41AM by Rustin.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All the players, including myself, are pretty avid WOW players.<br/>\nHere's a thought I just had, not sure how valid it is.  I think WOW, with the Crit numbers that are set to show up at a specific rate (i'm sure its been psychologically tested for optimal addiction) have coached my specific group to expect a big hit within a learned reward cycle.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom my understanding, those big numbers don't pop unless you're a striker class.<br/>\nI think, with previous versions of DnD, the best way to show off your abilities would be to post huge numbers (not the only way to show off your roleplaying skills, of course).  So it is a double wammy, going from 3.5 and Wow to 4e, for that specific reward from roleplaying.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, a tangent point.

To give the players clear direction and get everyone participating.  I've played it where the GM, as you say "describe[s] the situation like you always do, maybe drawing more attention to what the characters perceive as opportunities to act on."  And one or two players, whichever ones have the skills that seem to fit best (in one encounter it might seem like Athletics and Thievery on the only ones useful, in another Diplomacy and Bluff) and everyone else sits back, and in my case, wishing I could contribute but as a Fighter with very few skills, unless the two I'm really good at come up, there's no point.<br><br>When its run more structured in that "This is a Skill Challenge" you can go around the table and get participation from everyone.  Now I can use my Intimidation or Endurance because it's my turn and I have to do something! Intimidation while drinking with some dock workers?  Hey, yeah, I'm showing how menacing I am by drinking them under the table.  I could have used Endurance, but it's not a preferred skill for the challenge.  And I actually see Religion and History get used, as well other many other skills, in a variety of creative ways.

There were several 2s, as I recall.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>In addition, it adds some drama to the game with rules for "guiding light," "heroic surge," "bold recovery," and "time of trials." I tested it in my last game and it was a lot of fun. We even had a bold recovery, which made the challenge (a court trial accusing the PCs of stealing a day of time from the universe) very exciting.</blockquote>\nI'm reluctant to dabble too much here; I've had mixed results with these kinds of "structured debate" mechanics in the past. My wife really disliked the structure of Duel of Wits, for example, but liked the more flexible approaches in other games.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>The "table chatter" you refer to -- is it fun for the players? Is it fun for them but not you? If so, can you get involved and make it fun for you? [...] When they're talking about how they're going to find the guy or talk to people, you can suggest how that translates into a roll.</blockquote>\nI think this is how I would likely handle things in the future. It being the "introduction to 4e" game for our group, I was probably over-emphasizing the rules, and the interplay between mechanics and roleplay suffered as a result. The table chatter was fine, and in any other system, would have been perfectly comfortable with the segue.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>I'm gonna flag something you said: "eventually we moved on to the rest of the story." Whose story? What do you mean there? How does this relate to your feeling that the game was stalled in table-talk?</blockquote>\nSorry, the table-talk is a distraction here. I meant something more like, "The players seemed stalled. Distilling the conversation, they were frustrated at failure, and weren't seeing a happy way out of the skill challenge." I had hoped the "find him" challenge would have felt more ... organic? Less of a "get this distraction out of the way so we can get with the gaming".\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>Whiffing (rolling bad and feeling like a doofus) can be a problem in D&amp;D. I have handled that with great success using what I call Blood Tokens. Every time a player fails a d20 roll, they get a blood token (I have red glass beads). They can cash these in (all of them, not just a few at a time) for +2 for each token they turn in. They can do this after they fail a roll, if they want.</blockquote>\nI like this idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_169172">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169172/#Comment_169172" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-15T13:38:54+00:00" title="September 15, 2008  1:38PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">When its run more structured in that "This is a Skill Challenge" you can go around the table and get participation from everyone.

The GM who did skill challenges structured, also prohibited Aid rolls, so I can't speak fully from my experience.  I did try my second turn up because I didn't see a way to use a skill, but the GM said no and we quickly figured out a way I could contribute that was both useful and fun for me.<br><br>I know unstructured it doesn't happen a whole lot. Although a lot of times I'll throw out an Aid as an idea just so my fighter has a chance to do something! (A lot of the unstructured skill challenges have been social, which could also explain my stance against it.) Aid as still happened very rarely. Usually three of us are sitting out while the two PCs with the ample skills (the Warlord and Rogue) run the whole show. The GM might be partly to blame, still getting used to the method, but mostly its I don't see a chance to jump in, and without an opening, I won't force my way in. Luckily the two skillful PCs are also played by the two most outgoing players.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_169193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169193/#Comment_169193" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-15T14:11:16+00:00" title="September 15, 2008  2:11PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, forcing my way in has never been a problem of mine.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut you mean to say that if you were in a social situation and you described your boorish but freakishly large Dragonborn Fighter glowering, cracking his oversized knuckles and exhaling small jets of smoke, your DM wouldn't have you make an Intimidate Check to give +2 Aid another to Mr Fast Talking Half Elf diplomat dude?<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally I think if DMs just remembered 1) Skill Checks 2) +2 Aid Another AND 3) +2 Combat Positioning and used those A TON (like old school T&amp;T; Saving Throws) that most of the 4E non powery rules could just be winged...cuz mostly that's what they all boil down to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_169200">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Georgios" title="Georgios"><img alt="Georgios" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Georgios">Georgios</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169200/#Comment_169200" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-15T14:26:10+00:00" title="September 15, 2008  2:26PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the preference for explicit or implicit Skill Challenges has a lot to do with how you're used to roleplay. As in, it has a lot to do with when you see "an opening for you to contribute to the game". I have played with people who followed a very clear and almost strict turn/speaking order even when they were roleplaying freely. They responded only to specific, game-related cues in the fiction and would otherwise either stay quiet or fall back on out-of-game chatter. It works very well for them. Most of the time I'm playing with people who carry on roleplaying and making decision for and with their characters regardless of whether the GM has given them an explicit situation or cue to respond to. It's simply something people grow accustomed to.<br><br>The people I game with fall into the latter category, so implicit Skill Challenges would fit into our roleplaying habits much better. An explicit Skill Challenges would feel intrusive and somehow constraining. So while we'd still use Skill Challenges, we prefer not to draw attention to the mechanics and structures involved.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_169211">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169211/#Comment_169211" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-15T14:54:59+00:00" title="September 15, 2008  2:54PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jaw6</cite>How did you introduce the system, and transition from table chatter to running the skill challenge?</blockquote>\nThe other players are relatively up-to-speed on 4E, so the system was pre-introduced.<br><br>As for the transition... this is how I do it:<br><br>"Roll initiative."<br><br><br><br>Cheers,<br>Roger                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_169228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169228/#Comment_169228" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-15T15:56:21+00:00" title="September 15, 2008  3:56PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I used the formal, "Now for a skill challenge" method of play the other night in the game I ran, and it worked very well, since the number of rolls acted much like hit points do (as a pacing mechanism).

Yeah, it looks more complicated on paper, but I think that's due to average (not poor) technical writing.<br><br>In my own words, it looks like this: Run a typical skill challenge but use Stalker0's chart instead of the one in the book. You can designate certain skills as "helpful" (+3 to aid another instead of +2), "secondary" (you need to "unlock" them with another skill check first), or "bold" (get bonuses in certain situations). Pick one player each lap around the table as the "guiding light," and they get to Aid Another with some special benefits. Spend healing surges for a +2 or +3 bonus to checks. If you're about to fail your last check ("time of trials"), another player can make a "bold recovery" and save everyone's bacon.<br><br>Most of those rules can be ignored until they're useful or relevant to play. Just run it as a normal skill challenge with a guiding light. As DM, manage the helpful, secondary, and bold skills quietly and behind the scenes. When it's the time of trials and the players fail, offer the bold recovery.<br><br/>I've run it once and it was a LOT of fun and very tense.                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_169387">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169387/#Comment_169387" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-16T08:27:39+00:00" title="September 16, 2008  8:27AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rustin,<br/><br/>Fair enough.

I don't expect everyone plays that way, nor should they.<br/><br/>However, if your answer is "skill challenges have no place in my games at all," then I don't understand why you're participating in this thread. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_169455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169455/#Comment_169455" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-16T11:46:06+00:00" title="September 16, 2008 11:46AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>But you mean to say that if you were in a social situation and you described your boorish but freakishly large Dragonborn Fighter glowering, cracking his oversized knuckles and exhaling small jets of smoke, your DM wouldn't have you make an Intimidate Check to give +2 Aid another to Mr Fast Talking Half Elf diplomat dude?</blockquote>\nOdd, you covered the two character I played in one blow (Warforged Fighter and Dragonborn Warlord, both great intimidators).  <br/><br/>Well, the Gm who allows aid rolls certainly would. But the Half-Elf already has a +12 to Diplomacy (actually that was level one, it might be +13 now) and even though he's using higher DCs that the errata would suggest, she pretty much can't fail except on a 1 most of the time. Although the problem there is usually getting a word in edge wise.<br/><br/>With the GM who doesn't allow Aid rolls, I don't know.  It was a con game, and if I recall, his opposition to Aid rolls was because it slowed things down and can make things too easy.  What we did instead was having me roll Intimidate for a chance at gaining a success for the challenge setting up the "good cop" player with a diplomacy to try and gain a second success.  There were no bonuses (unless he adjusted things "behind the screen") except for GM's Friend in clever ideas and roleplaying.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_169457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169457/#Comment_169457" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-16T11:51:19+00:00" title="September 16, 2008 11:51AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know what else slows things down and makes things too easy?
