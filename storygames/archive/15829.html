What should that look like? What would you find most useful for running a megadungeon as the tentpole for a long-term campaign? Are there insights from play mats, boardgames, etc. that could make the design tight and elegant?<br/>\n<br/>\nUndirected on backer rewards:<br/>\nExtrapolating from the rapid progress of <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/142014231/players-companion-for-adventurer-conqueror-king?ref=card" rel="nofollow">Autarch's current Kickstarter</a> and the fact that Grognardia is an order of magnitude bigger than anything else in the OSR, the Dwimmermount crowdfunding is going to be able to make all kinds of cool rewards possible.

Bookhounds is a Trail of Cthulhu campaign frame set in the murky world of book dealers in 30s London. It was packed with a special edition of the Book of the Smoke, a guide to occult London, written from the point of view of a 30s occultist and containing no game or modern references, it looks like a 30s book. These came with a piece of 1930s ephemera, perhaps a small book or pamphlet, a masonic apron and in one case a microscope and slides. Then each one got two or three period postcards and some coins (some English, some foreign). Furthermore we commissioned an occult map of London which was cut up and distributed to European subscribers. US subscribers got an occult token. All of this was put in a rucksack stencilled with an occult symbol and the name of the author of the occult guide.

Scaling up the top-level rewards just gets too expensive - we couldn't do the one where you get the Sultan + the maze because it wouldn't be affordable within the $10K cap imposed by Kickstarter. <br/><br/>The creative input ones are a careful dance between letting people make their mark on the setting and the feeling that what we want to get is Dwimmermount as James originally envisioned it. That dance plays out really well when it involves actual play - we all love that the way elves are described will reflect him accomodating ideas his players brought to the table - so I've focused on opportunities to work actual play into the mix. Most visibly is the artist in residence program for the Adept illustration rewards; you don't have to say "would this art order really reflect this setting" because the artist is drawing something that did happen in a session - but that's also implied in the backer feedback from Neophyte on up. It's great when the person with the best idea for a place during their home session or at one of our events can post it at the forums and James will run with that as he's fleshing out his original GM notes with the memory of ideas that came up in his campaign. It's kind of artificial when the person who pays the right amount gets to name the place, and doesn't drive making the product better.<br/><br/>GB Steve, I love that package! Kickstarter is also awesome because it lets you package together experiences and products - at the most basic level you're getting the experience of being in on the ground floor and backstage during rehearsal - and that is a great experience that's directly relevant to the game and what gamers like.<br/><br/>Was there a feedback loop between the mystery and the product - like did you listen to see what people decided was the solution, and then write the best ideas into the book? (Oh how much better would shows like Lost be if they were crowdfunded and could reduce the delay in this loop; as we've said here about the Cracked article it's clear they are using the GM method of making it up as they go along, but handicapped by it being months too late to use the GM method of letting your players supply ideas when they think they're solving a pre-existing mystery.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364526">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364526/#Comment_364526" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-02T05:41:33+00:00" title="March  2, 2012  5:41AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tavis</cite>Was there a feedback loop between the mystery and the product - like did you listen to see what people decided was the solution, and then write the best ideas into the book?

The book itself is open-ended and doesn't solve the mystery of who killed its author. There was going to be a competition for the best solution but it's been very collaborative so that's not appropriate. So the best way to take the work people have done in the thread and turn it into something publishable has yet to be decided.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364534">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tavis" title="Tavis"><img alt="Tavis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tavis">Tavis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364534/#Comment_364534" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-02T06:17:15+00:00" title="March  2, 2012  6:17AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So cool!

The lesson (rightly or wrongly) was to focus on getting the economy of scale in the format that was less easy to do with customer-side POD. People who would have paid $25 but not $40 are still customers at the $10 level, and enabling them to do softcover POD makes it easier to handle shipping. Getting books overseas proves to be a major issue - in the 21st century gamers are surprisingly worldwide - so if we can work with a local equivalent of Lulu that's a big advantage.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
