So having character death be too frequent and random is a bad thing, because the shitty feeling actually comes up, but having it not be possible (for certain players and games) is just as bad a thing because then you don't have the satisfaction which comes with completing a difficult and risky task.<br/><br/>What are ways that have been done with systems that mechanically can have your character die, theoretically in any encounter with a string of bad results, but are set up so that in reality it doesn't happen much, without cheapening that reality to the point that you don't expect character death and lose the satisfaction of not dying, but still get that sinking feeling when it actually happens?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281464">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon" title="lordgoon"><img alt="lordgoon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon">lordgoon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281464/#Comment_281464" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-18T11:52:15+00:00" title="July 18, 2010 11:52AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As far as I have ever been able to discover, there's only one way around this problem. First, one has to always make sure that every character death has meaning and importance within the overall structure of the narrative. This isn't too difficulty even in luck-heavy games, and it's dead easy elsewhere. Second, one has to ensure that players get more satisfaction from the overall narrative than they do from advancing their characters. This will in most cases either be a foregone conclusion or utterly impossible, depending upon whom you' replaying with.<br/><br/>The one thing that bothers me about this feature of most RPGs in which there's any such thing as "player characters," (which excludes a surprisingly large number of games, e.g. <i>Universalis</i>, <i>Everyone is John</i>) is that it requires an absolutely non-negotiable sacrifice of realism, since in the real world there are obviously plenty of deaths that are pure happenstance, and plenty of people who won't be able to derive comfort from a narrative in compensation for this fact. I've occasionally seen hints that some games (<i>Apocalypse World</i>, maybe?) make an aggressive attempt to be more realistic in this respect. I'd be curious to hear what others have to say about the topic, at any rate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_281469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jprussell" title="jprussell"><img alt="jprussell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jprussell">jprussell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281469/#Comment_281469" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-18T12:07:12+00:00" title="July 18, 2010 12:07PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lordgoon</cite>The one thing that bothers me about this feature of most RPGs in which there's any such thing as "player characters," (which excludes a surprisingly large number of games, e.g.<i>Universalis</i>,<i>Everyone is John</i>) is that it requires an absolutely non-negotiable sacrifice of realism, since in the real world there are obviously plenty of deaths that are pure happenstance, and plenty of people who won't be able to derive comfort from a narrative in compensation for this fact.</blockquote>\nWell, sure, but I'd say this is no more a sacrifice of realism than you see in stories of any sort (books, movies, whatever). Sure, some will have 'meaningless deaths' just to prove they're different, but those tend to piss off the audience <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I tend to take a sort of 'retcon' approach to dealing with this: these events are a story *because* they meaningfully address a narrative. In other words, the reason we follow Conan around the Hyborian age is because he had a lot of narratively significant stuff happening to and around him. The reason we're playing *these* guys in *this* dungeon is because there are satisfying themes going on, but there's probably some other band of looters dying horribly in traps or being eaten by trolls or whatever for no satisfying reason. <br/><br/>And all that is only if you're into thinking of the fictional world as a coherent place that you're accessing, rather than something being created for a purpose as you go, with only those parts that suit the purpose existing. (Wow, that was a vague sentence, but as a side note, I *do* like thinking of the fiction as a coherent world with stuff going on outside of the immediate context of the game/story/film). But I don't think 'realism' is a usual concern for people who are shooting for 'make things up that support the sort of story I want, and that's their whole existence'. I could be wrong, there, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281471">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281471/#Comment_281471" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-18T12:31:16+00:00" title="July 18, 2010 12:31PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If every death has meaning and that's known,then that's effectively the same as players knowing their characters can't die at all. For the tension to be there you have to have the potential of meaningless character death. Either you have it sucking on the one hand because it doesn't seem like the character can die (unless that's what you want, different type of game which is perfectly fine) or you have it sucking on the other hand because characters die too frequently. <br/><br/>I guess a good example of where I got the balance working right is I had a 3.5 Elf Bard (which I was told was a bad build), by the time I'd hit second level I had nearly died so many times that I realised this was true, so I took a level of Barbarian. I had the rage ability to bring into play any time I was near death for temporary extra hit points, but there was still the concern of dropping dead immediately after. The balance of not dying and tension was great, but in 3.5's case only possible with a Barbarian. I'm interested in being able to walk that line with every character, where you're regularly close to death, but if everything is played out with good tactics you end up surviving.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_281476">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281476/#Comment_281476" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-18T13:14:58+00:00" title="July 18, 2010  1:14PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 18, 2010 1:44PM by James_Mullen.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Posted By: migo&lt;/cite&gt;If every death has meaning and that's known,then that's effectively the same as players knowing their characters can't die at all. For the tension to be there you have to have the potential of meaningless character death. &lt;/blockquote&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI can't see how knowing my character's death, if it happens, will at least be a meaningful death and not just a random bit of bad luck a) is the same as knowing my character can't die and b) detracts from the tension of the story. Could you unpack that argument a bit, with some examples of situations that illustrate your point?<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: On reflection, it seems that two conflicting definitions of tension have been collated into one argument. First, there's the satisfaction of Narrative Tension, e.g. what's going to happen next? As a reader, viewer or player of a story, I can't be sure where that story is going and what revelations will be made or what fates will befall each character. A random, meaningless death produces the kind of shitty experience mentioned.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand though, there is Sporting Tension, e.g. will I win or lose? As a gamer, I try to optimise my strategies for the best outcome and min/max everything as far as possible, but I still can't be sure that some random bad luck will wipe me out... or secure my absolute victory. I rely on luck for both, so absolute victory and random death are consequences I accept at the start when I sit down to play.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, if I want a satisfying narrative experience, I want guarantees that my character's death will not be random and meaningless; whereas for a satifsying sporting experience, I want the sensation of having played well and beaten the odds, which requires the risk of losing/dying. Therefore, I'll make choices at the very start as to which type of game I want to play, which will provide the type of experience I'm looking for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281483">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281483/#Comment_281483" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-18T13:43:02+00:00" title="July 18, 2010  1:43PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 18, 2010 1:43PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some ways to make it not suck:<br><br>Make it not matter thematically (See 3:16)<br><br>Make it very much matter thematically (See TSOY)<br><br>Make it irrelevant to the player's engagement (See Grey Ranks)<br><br>Remove character monogamy (See Archipelago II)<br/><br/>Make it a cool stepping stone to further play (See Hero's Banner)<br/><br/>Make it a binary choice (See Montesgur 1244)<br/><br/>In none of these games can death suck.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_281485">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jprussell" title="jprussell"><img alt="jprussell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jprussell">jprussell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281485/#Comment_281485" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-18T14:03:24+00:00" title="July 18, 2010  2:03PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason is smart!

(And if so, does it suck more or less than the other ways that the character might fail?  Could the stakes for most conflicts actually be something besides just life or death, and would that make the few times when death is on the table seem to matter more?)<br/><br/>Or does it suck because it punishes the player, by taking them out of the game until they can make a new character, get their dead character resurrected, and/or come back into the game?  (If this is the case, why are you punishing the player?  Could there be another way to have a character die without making it impossible for the player to continue participating in the game?  Could character creation and re-introduction be streamlined?  Could the dead character continue to participate in the fight at some penalty, and only actually die at the end of the scene?  Could the player participate in some other way: getting to spend his remaining fate points on the actions of other players, running NPC allies, etc.?)<br/><br/>Or does it suck because it ruins the story?  (Does the group feel like the story is better when the original characters see it through to the end?  Is there a way to make the loss of a character and/or the introduction of replacement characters something that enhances the story rather than taking away from it?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_281489">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281489/#Comment_281489" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-18T14:28:49+00:00" title="July 18, 2010  2:28PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think there's usually a combination of attachment to the character and punishing the player.

That sucked pretty badly, with the verisimilitude necessary for introducing a new character into the party.<br/><br/>I'm thinking in some instances re-introduction could be streamlined by having NPCs that occasionally show up to help the party in various instances, usually work alone, and conveniently pops up shortly after a death. "Why fancy meeting you here, why don't we team up again to finish this off?"<br/><br/>Another thing I'm thinking is similar to what's being proposed for Guild Wars 2 - if you "die" you get a short period of time where you have limited abilities, if you kill off whoever it is that killed you, you come back to life at the brink. If you take too long to get revenge, then you die for good. There's always the chance for the save there, and it's more involved than rolling a saving throw. No solution for traps though, but some could be handled with SotC's off screen death.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281492">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281492/#Comment_281492" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-18T15:18:48+00:00" title="July 18, 2010  3:18PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 18, 2010 3:19PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: migo</cite><br/>Can you go into detail about how each game handles death?</blockquote>\n3:16 - you are a useless grunt.

It would be an immature reaction to say that <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i> is a shitty book because Sidney dies at the end, but it makes perfect sense to say that last night's game was shitty because your character died even if you thought that a great story was told and that your character's death was integral to it. The enjoyment of an RPG does and should come both from identifying your interests with those of the PCs in-game interests and from enjoying a well-told story. The fact that these goals can come into conflict is why there's really nothing similar to the GNS theory for literary criticism.<br/><br/>I agree that most of the games Jason mentioned are partial exceptions to this, but I find several of them unattractive for just this very reason. The exceptions are <i>Grey Ranks</i> and <i>Montsegur</i>, both of which are fundamentally tragic games in a way that I need to think more about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281524">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281524/#Comment_281524" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-18T19:33:45+00:00" title="July 18, 2010  7:33PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's not false, it's quite simple.

In the vast majority of media out there, you know that the main character won't die. Even if the situation seems like it will cause tension, it's not there, and if there's a surprise kill, it's not like there was tension leading up to it. Even though there were warning signs all over the Season 4 finale of Dexter, I wasn't concerned that any main character would die. \n<blockquote><br/>"Montsegur" is a perfect example of this: the tension of dearth looms over ALL the game, from star to finish, because everybody knows that some of these character will die.

It doesn't have to be the die rolls themselves, but the tension comes from the randomness, uncertainty and possibility of death. And yes, if I know the character only dies at the end there's no tension. If the character dies halfway through, it's unexpected but again no tension because it's unexpected.\n<blockquote><br/>And it's true that in TSOY you can't die until you risk death. But this only mean that you always have to consider risking death as an option.</blockquote>\nIf you don't want to die, you can pass it over as an option. That puts death firmly in your hands, at least the possibility of it, and the only thing that's out of your hands is that you might not die. I don't see how that creates tension.\n<blockquote><br/>I think that gaming culture too ofter mistake some limitation of older game system as "the way thing have to be".

We know the answer to that question, it's make it so that character death doesn't equal punish the player.<br><br>Robin is, as far as I can tell, asking a different question. For those of us who want there to be a thrill of success, how do we make character death happen with enough frequency so that it feels possible and arbitrary, but too frequently?<br/><br/>Now, me, personally, I can't answer that question. The first part kills it for me. I don't equate thrill of success with the possibility of character death (nor am I hoping for thrill of success when I play), so hey, this question isn't addressed to me. Also, my priorities when playing are so different that I don't ever want character death to feel arbitrary.<br/><br/>So Jason, your examples are great, if the question really was, how do you make character death not shitty. But that's just not Robin's question.<br/><br/>Of course, I have no idea why Robin is asking their question <i>here</i>... this place seems destined to give the answers it gave. But, I will throw up a ray of hope. Find Red Box Hack, it might do what you are asking.

And actually sky diving is pretty much exactly what I'm aiming for in this question. When you jump out of a plane, you know that if something goes wrong, you go splat and die. That's thrilling. You also know that it's highly unlikely, but that small chance of something going wrong and killing you creates the thrill. Now, I'll step into Dexter again, we know that Dexter is a popular TV series, and therefore if Dexter dies, there's no more show and no more money for Showtime. Therefore, Dexter has plot immunity from death. When he got captured and shoved in a car, we knew he wouldn't die. For him it was entirely different, because he doesn't know he's in a story, and every day it's uncertain for him. Now to get that feeling of tension, thrill and excitement in an RPG, there has to be that same "reality" for the player characters, for the player to get that kind of tension.<br/><br/>It's entirely a matter of personal preference, I have minimal interest in anything to do with World of Darkness, but I can also totally see why some people love it. The dark and depressing aspect is entirely the point of it, and if you like it it's great, if you don't it sucks. For me, it's damn satisfying in D&amp;D to narrowly escape death, but actually having it happen usually means that's the end of me playing due to the time investment (although one time in a Planescape campaign I had my character crushed to death in the Modron March and immediately replaced it with a Rogue Modron, but that was pretty much planned, when the Modron died, I didn't feel like following up). <br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: chearns</cite>Of course, I have no idea why Robin is asking their question<i>here</i>... this place seems destined to give the answers it gave</blockquote>\nThere doesn't strike me as being a strong bias for any type of game. I've seen plenty of threads on traditional RPGs and D&amp;D 4e here, and they're discussed in the same way as narrative focused rules light games. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Thanks, you are totally right, I did not read the original post carefully enough.

You build a character core (a general archetype for the characters you'd like to play across any setting.) Yet, you also build a character for each individual game. It might have been a good model for building characters in a single game and setting. Then you can make new characters following the bigger core quickly, and any awards are upshifted to the core up to the point of death. It would make for an interesting generational game or one centered on legacies and roles.

You say that in a game like TSoY, you do not experience this "tension" because you can always choose to avoid (permanent) death.<br/><br/>Consider this analogy:<br/><br/>When you play Poker, you can always choose to fold. If you fold, you are guaranteed not to lose the game--only the ante (a minor setback). Does this remove tension from the game?<br/><br/>The lesson is that you can't separate an individual choice from the rest of the game. In a game like Dogs or TSoY choosing to live is always meaningful, and, like in Poker, it usually means some kind of victory or gain for your opponents. Like in Poker, you have to constantly weigh the risk of death (losing the game) against what you're trying to achieve. It's hard for me to see how someone could look at that and not call it "tension".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_281722">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281722/#Comment_281722" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-19T12:36:41+00:00" title="July 19, 2010 12:36PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In regards to the poker analogy, you can choose in a D&amp;D game not to bite the plot hook, and therefore not worry about dying, all you lose is your time investment in making the character to do nothing. It's about the same thing. There's no tension in poker if you fold every time, because you know you'll slowly lose all your chips in antes. If you're choosing to fold when you see the odds are against you, it also removes tension. I've played poker games like that, and the only time tension came in was when it was getting late and the other players decided to change it from whoever wins the whole pot gets it to whoever has the most chips by X time gets the whole pot. I didn't like that, but it wasn't actually related to the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281734">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281734/#Comment_281734" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-19T13:02:39+00:00" title="July 19, 2010  1:02PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In Dogs, you can avoid the risk of dying by groveling or running away every time someone pulls a weapon, but otherwise, it's a risk you take, not a choice you make.<br/><br/>I lost a big post about how it works. :-( I'll recompose, but it might be tomorrow or later.<br/><br/>-Vincent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_281737">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell" title="John_Powell"><img alt="John_Powell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/nP846SDWNCDOK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell">John_Powell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281737/#Comment_281737" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-19T13:27:52+00:00" title="July 19, 2010  1:27PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 19, 2010 1:28PM by John_Powell.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In <i><b>Empire of Dust</b></i> any combat can result with a PC getting gored.

If you're playing to win, you should be minimizing your sense of tension and risk; and if you're playing for the thrill of risking it all, you shouldn't expect to win money.  Choose your game, and play it accordingly.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: migo</cite>While that's certainly interesting, like Dread, inevitable death isn't what I'm looking for.</blockquote>\nWho said anything about death being inevitable?  I'm just saying, if you want a life-or-death struggle to really be intense, you might be better off making it an uncommon situation: build up to it, so that when the moment finally arrives where your character's life hinges on the results of the dice, it is genuinely climactic rather than, y'know, just the fifteenth time you've risked death in the last half-hour.<br/><br/>Having mechanics that allow you to take a smaller (or larger!) setback but preserve your character's life can give you more options and more chances for genuine tension, not fewer.  If you think the moment is important enough (or you just want the thrill of risking it all), you can choose to put it all on the line; or if it seems like it would be more interesting and exciting to postpone that moment, you can do so and let the tension continue to build.<br/><br/><br/>Edit:<br/>\\/\\/\\/  Jesse's post below is pure distilled awesome, by the way!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_281780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281780/#Comment_281780" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-19T16:36:47+00:00" title="July 19, 2010  4:36PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So playing Burning Empires I had a big revelation about this.  What makes this work is that there has to be something else at stake in the fight OTHER than the character dying.  In Burning Empires using a Firefight conflict simply to kill someone is against the rules.  You have to explicitly what you tactically hope to achieve with the fire fight and life and death is a BY PRODUCT of the fight itself.<br/><br/>I've now started taking note of this in fiction.  I've been reading the Dresden Files books lately.  The following is said with advance apologies to Mr. Butcher.  In book four there's this extended multi-chapter fight in a Walmart.  The bad guys have only one Agenda: Kill Dresden and his friend Murphy.  Both are recurring characters and one is the star of the series.  There is absolutely nothing else at stake in the scene.  The only question on the table is do Dresden and Murphy get whacked by the bad guys?  By the very nature of the media the only answer can be NO.  It reduces the scene from one of conflict to one of exposition.  Dresden discovers something important during the fight that lets him move the plot along.  For me, the scene was incredibly protracted and uninteresting to read because of this.<br/><br/>In book five, however, there's a scene where some bad guys show up.  However, there's a lot more going on.  First of all they seem interested in *capturing* not killing Dresden.  There's a also a McGuffin they want.  And third, there's a not-known-to-be-recurring third character in the scene who is a liability.  Suddenly the scene becomes much more dynamic.  We know Dresden can't die but there's A LOT more to lose in the scene than just his life.  His freedom, the McGuffin and the life of the third character are all legitimately on the line.<br/><br/>In an RPG context, you're generally free from the "on going series" constraint.  You don't have a publisher to answer to which means your character can legitimately be on the line in such scenes.  If you combine this with certain system elements that basically allow the player to yield the other things at stake in exchange for reduced chance of death then you put a lot of narrative power over death in the player's hands.  Basically every moment of the fight is asking, "Is this worth dying for?"<br/><br/>What that means is that if the player doesn't feel this is the "it" moment for his character then he can always stop.  He can always say, "No, take the McGuffin, we'll fight again for it later."  Or "No, let the NPC die, I'll avenger later." and so on.  Whatever ELSE is at stake in the scene can be exchanged for the life of the PC and will therefore automatically create an interesting evolution in the developing story.  If on the OTHER hand the player goes, no, this really IS worth dying for.  And pushes themselves and actually DOES get himself killed well, then, that can't ever not be meaningful.  We found the reason they were willing to die.  After all they could have yielded and lived.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281827/#Comment_281827" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-20T01:03:48+00:00" title="July 20, 2010  1:03AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 20, 2010 1:17AM by noclue.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>The only question on the table is do Dresden and Murphy get whacked by the bad guys?

The question with Murphy is always how fucked up is her life going to get for sticking by Dresden and how miserable is that going to make him feel.<br/><br/>I do find it interesting that we don't produce movies or write books where the protagonist gets halfway through the character arc and then just randomly dies, but the stories are still imbued with tension. However, with RPGs often the rules make this kind of meaningless death possible to imbue conflicts with jeopardy and provide a sense of relief if the character survives, but then players are left with dealing with the aftereffects when the character does not. So, then some RPGs have developed rules to circumvent death, like resurrection in AD&amp;D, where now death is no big thing. And then they often try to make resurrection rare or costly, to put some of the sting back into death.<br/><br/>It seems contradictory to want death to be an ever present threat on the one hand, but always meaningful and thematic on the other.

A lot.  One big aspect of the game is overcoming the challenge posed by the environment (pre-cooked setting).  Any information gained is a big benefit.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's why I decided to let player knowledge = character knowledge.  A PC death is a setback (and it will be a pretty big one, since all new PCs start at 1st level), but the game is about challenging the player, so even in death the player gains something.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother big aspect on the DM's side is that one of my rules is to make the choices of the players matter.  One of the ways I do this is by revealing the choices they've made - and the consequences of those choices - when they head back to town.  (I hacked the Daily Powers in order to make sure this happens, though I haven't got a chance to playtest it yet - like I've said, there's been a lot of death.)  Once the PCs are back in town the DM is supposed to reveal the changes the PCs have made to the setting.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat this adds up to is that even if your PC dies or is captured, you still gained something to aid you in future play, and you can see the impact your choices made on the campaign.<br/>\n<br/>\n* - Actually there have been more captured PCs than deaths, but either way the PC has been removed from play.  In the case of captured PCs, only for the moment; rescued PCs will end up as henchmen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_281864">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281864/#Comment_281864" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-20T08:28:04+00:00" title="July 20, 2010  8:28AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite>It seems contradictory to want death to be an ever present threat on the one hand, but always meaningful and thematic on the other. Something's gotta give</blockquote>\nYou misunderstand, I'm not going for ever present and meaningful, I'm going for ever present and infrequent. Like skydiving. There's always the thought in the back of your mind that the parachute might not open. You know that the odds are very good in your favour that it will open, and maybe there's a 1/1000 chance that it won't, so you do it anyway, but the fact that you survive hurtling towards the ground at that speed is exhilirating. I'm looking for the same thing in combat. In systems where life is cheap, surviving is that much sweeter. Death is a huge inconvenience to say the least though, and it also is a downer, so if it happens frequently enough it starts feeling like a crapshoot and taking any satisfaction of survival away, because that satisfaction will only be fleeting. <br><br>I'm thinking something like segmented health bars in video games. How it works is that your health bar is split into 4 sections. Each section regenerates by itself, but once it's taken out completely, it doesn't regenerate. So if each section has 100 points, if you're down to 1/100 you can survive and get back to 100/100, but if it hits 0/100, you've got until you can get healing 3/4 of your health left. So survivability is actually quite high, but there's actually a pretty constant threat if you screw up of losing one segment entirely, and that makes you that much more vulnerable for the rest of the game (since you regenerate, health packs are pretty sparse rather than available everywhere). You could even have some boss monsters that could take out 2 segments with a single attack, so you want to be at full health when you take him on to survive, otherwise your chances are severely diminished.<br><br>Now obviously trying to transplant a video game mechanic straight to a PnP RPG won't necessarily work, but that's an example. Since you can actually regenerate health, you're probably not going to die, and in practice you don't really have the chance of dying in each battle, but serious injury in one battle means you can die in the next one.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281868">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281868/#Comment_281868" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-20T10:50:11+00:00" title="July 20, 2010 10:50AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Robin, <br><br>Just to make things clear, do you want to trick players into perceiving the risk of character death as higher than it actually is? There are lots of techniques out there for that. In addition there is a wealth of research over the past few decades on how people perceive uncertainty that can be exploited to cause this mis-estimation. <br><br>Alternatively, are you more interesting in finding the sweet spot of risk / reward that is most likely to maximize player enjoyment from an accurately perceived "death risk"? If so, be aware that both fictional attachment and particular degrees of risk aversion / attraction are variable enough to require your ideal game to heavily customize to the player, especially as reward/punishment dynamics of the "death risk" will necessarilly change a player's sweet spot. <br><br>When talking probability in game design it is essential distinguish between the odds and the perception of the odds, they far too often have little to do with each other.<br><br>   - Mendel                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_281875">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur" title="cwilbur"><img alt="cwilbur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">cwilbur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281875/#Comment_281875" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-20T11:27:12+00:00" title="July 20, 2010 11:27AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What it sounds like to me is that migo wants the *perception* that death is common and always a risk, with the *actuality* that death is infrequent.  I don't think that this is possible to sustain: even if you find one of the psychological tricks that will make people mis-estimate the odds of dying, in the long term players will notice that characters don't die very often.

When you take that leap, your amygdala estimates the chance of you dying at 100%, even though your cerebrum knows that unless there's equipment failure or you do something stupid, you're going to survive.  You are going to have a very difficult time transferring that gut-level reaction to imaginary characters.<br/><br/>And people are pattern-matchers.  If you want the perception among players that recklessness plus bad luck, or merely bad luck, can kill a character, then you have to create a situation where recklessness plus bad luck, or merely bad luck, *does* kill a character.  But if you want death to *also* be infrequent, you need to create a situation where recklessness and bad luck *don't* often kill characters, because characters are often reckless and players often have bad luck.  If you create a situation where you say death is common and often a risk, but in play it winds up being infrequent, players will pay attention not to what you say but to what actually happens. <br/><br/>You *can* have players know that character death is a frequent risk, but only if it really is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

extreme sports in general. Hell, it's even possible in fighting - people don't die with any frequency in MMA, in fact lower than almost any other sport but it does happen. It can be done in real life, why can't it be done in a game? And it's not about fooling someone about the probabilities, the players just need to know that in any given fight if they're reckless and have some bad luck they could die, and in serious fights even if they're prudent bad luck could kill them.</blockquote>\nNot to say that you're incorrect, but tabletop games don't get to "cheat" by thrusting you into situations to which you are evolutionarily predisposed to have a fear/thrill reaction (like jumping out of an airplane). Maybe there's a way to get a similar trick from a tabletop game, but it's probably far less visceral.<br/><br/>Fair enough, but there's also video games. First time I played Resistance I got killed rather quickly, then learned that the enemies could shoot through walls. Got a handle of that, and then I made it to the end of the level to be killed by the boss. Figure that out, and get it on the second go. I knew that if I fucked up, I'd die, therefore it was ever present, but once I knew how not to fuck up, it pretty much stopped happening. You still get the satisfaction from not dying there, because you know the reason you're not dying is because you're doing things properly. Super Mario would be another example, it's pretty easy to fall down a hole, but you can also go through every level without dying once and 30 lives to spare, and still get that satisfaction. It's different in skill based games than with an RPG, but it should still be possible somehow with character based skill to get that balance right.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281946/#Comment_281946" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-20T15:08:02+00:00" title="July 20, 2010  3:08PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Robin,<br/><br/>Everything I've said also applies to real life. For example, driving 250 miles each way to go sky-diving once a year may give you a big thrill. But which gives you the bigger thrill? The skydiving or the drive? <br/><br/>I can tell you that given some basic statistics I tracked down the drive gave you a bigger risk of death (roughly 400 miles of driving = 1 skydive, tandem dives for beginners are supposedly even safer). But is sure doesn't seem that way does it.<br/><br/>With life and with games often the reason we want to overcome challenges is to generally get better at overcoming them. Demonstrating competence, learning how to be more capable, and generally gaining acclaim from our peers all factor into this. The danger of completely stochastic "death gambles" is that they feel like strong reward punishment systems (because of how we are wired), but in reality they have no substance so people will get annoyed or bored by them rapidly - or create deeply maladaptive behaviors such as extreme risk aversion or risk attraction. <br/><br/>  - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_281957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Skage" title="Skage"><img alt="Skage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Skage">Skage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281957/#Comment_281957" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-20T16:02:24+00:00" title="July 20, 2010  4:02PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here is what it sounds like to me what you're saying: "How do I run games where there is a low probability of dying, but not so low that it never happen?" <br/><br/>D&amp;D has challenge ratings that try to handle that, where the DM is in control of how tough the villian is that your pcs are facing. This is a question of probability that's going to vary from game to game. <br/><br/>Another question, what about character death sucks for you? <br/>Is it just that while your character is dead you're not apart of the game? Or is it also because you care about the character's story?<br/><br/>If it's just that you're not actively participating in the game, then the gm could just let you play an npc while waiting for the next time you get a chance to bring in a new character. You don't have to have the moments when your last character died completely suck. Character death shouldn't be a punishment to the player. The player can't control the fact that luck wasn't on their side. "Awesome, my life doesn't get to suck until the next character!" I don't know about you, but I like playing in games where even if my character dies my night will still be fun. This doesn't mean that there's a cheapen feeling to wanting to keep my character alive. <br/><br/>Now, if you want the stories where possible death is always a plot point on screen during combat, that's extremely tough. Generally, those games are also only better as horror or one-shots for a lot of people. It's also tough to build a good story where you have combat on the screen a lot, and there's that chance that someone's going to die. The only way that I can think of to balance this out is only running combat scenes where plot is important enough for a character death. However, there are moments where fist need to fly, but character death isn't important enough to happen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281971">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281971/#Comment_281971" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-20T16:49:19+00:00" title="July 20, 2010  4:49PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: migo</cite><br/><br/>I'm thinking something like segmented health bars in video games. How it works is that your health bar is split into 4 sections. Each section regenerates by itself, but once it's taken out completely, it doesn't regenerate. So if each section has 100 points, if you're down to 1/100 you can survive and get back to 100/100, but if it hits 0/100, you've got until you can get healing 3/4 of your health left. So survivability is actually quite high, but there's actually a pretty constant threat if you screw up of losing one segment entirely, and that makes you that much more vulnerable for the rest of the game (since you regenerate, health packs are pretty sparse rather than available everywhere). You could even have some boss monsters that could take out 2 segments with a single attack, so you want to be at full health when you take him on to survive, otherwise your chances are severely diminished.<br/><br/>Now obviously trying to transplant a video game mechanic straight to a PnP RPG won't necessarily work, but that's an example. Since you can actually regenerate health, you're probably not going to die, and in practice you don't really have the chance of dying in each battle, but serious injury in one battle means you can die in the next one.</blockquote>\nAlbedo and Usagi Yojimbo (from <a href="http://www.sanguine.com" rel="nofollow">Sanguine</a>) both do something very mechanically similar.<br/>There are four "Wound" ranks.  <br/>Minor injuries net you the "Wounded" status.<br/>This isn't a big deal, except that it means enemies get to add dice to their Damage rolls agains you.<br/>Next up is "Crippled" which limits the actions you can take, then "Incapacitated" which knocks you out, and "Devastated" which is the Game Over of the game.<br/><br/>Usagi Yojimbo has no healing (except the passage of time).  You get screwed up, you know you are closer to death.<br/><br/>The important part for me is that these Wound ranks are a great indicator that death is near.  The question is "is it worth it to keep going?"  And players can intuitively understand that "enemies rolling more damage dice means increased chance of recieving an Incapacitating or Devastating injury."<br/><br/>Sure, they can sacrifice their objective and run, or they can choose to risk death and get the job done.<br/><br/>Further, there are martial arts techniques that you can use to shrink an injury down to a manageable one (turning Incapacitating Damage into Wounding Damage at the cost of being disarmed, or retreating, etc)  What usually happens is that players keep fighting until they are OUT OF TRICKS, or out of the resources needed to power those tricks, and then they run because they know death is imminent.<br/><br/>Is this the kind of system trick you are looking for?<br/><br/>Albedo is only slightly different, because it uses a varying hit point system for the Wound Thresholds based on body type, and they have some futuristic healing, but Albedo is also a great system because it allows you to intimidate enemies with bullets.

The players will calculate it. So, let's say there's a serious fight every game, and you want characters to die one game in ten. Sound reasonable? That way, in a game of four players, your character will die approximately every 40 games, on average. That's a long time \u2014\xa0probably a year of weekly games when you can't get together for 12 of those weeks for holidays, vacations, weddings, and, of course, funerals. So, every game, you should have a 1/40 chance of dying if you do everything right.</p>\n<p>Now, that's when they're being strategic, not picking fights with guys that are too big (and, in designing this system, you must make sure they don't get benefit \u2014\xa0or perhaps it even costs \u2014 to picking on guys too small, or it's just a game of bullying), and making good tactical choices. If they screw up in some way, you probably want their mortality to become markedly higher. A mismatch of weapon and technique, or failure rates of equipment, or not confirming information has to affect their mortality rate.</p>\n<p>I'd suggest that you figure out the truly dangerous things a character can do \u2014\xa0fight, climb great heights, make the wrong kinds of friends \u2014 and give them a 1/40 chance of catastrophic failure over the rough number of encounters that you'd have in your game over a year.</p>\n<p>Also, I would make it so that wounds, equipment failure, and the like don't threaten your ability to succeed, but <em>do</em> enhance your likelihood of dying. Like, if I pick a fight with a dragon and decide to go in alone, as an old man, against its poisoned and fiery breath, I've got a good shot at killing it, but it will almost certainly kill me. Make it so that <strong>desperation</strong> counts for something, and counts well, in fact. Make it so that, when your odds of survival are lowest, your odds of success are greatest.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_282070">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282070/#Comment_282070" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-21T09:01:33+00:00" title="July 21, 2010  9:01AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Random PC death in Dogs in the Vineyard</b><br/><br/>First, a most important feature of the game's rules: taking damage is a side effect of fighting, it's not how you resolve fights. You can take all the damage, yet win; you can dish out all the damage, yet lose.<br/><br/>When you take damage, you take it in the form of damage dice, which you leave on the table unrolled. The stronger the hit, the more damage dice: 3 damage dice for the weakest hit, up to 6 damage dice for the strongest. The more dangerous the weapon, the bigger the damage dice: d6s for a punch, d8s for most weapons, d10s for a gunshot. So a basic solid punch gets you 3d6 damage dice, while a basic solid gunshot gets you 3d10, and the most serious, decisive gunshot gets you 6d10. (In fact it can go even higher than 6 dice, but I've seen that in play only maybe once or twice.)<br/><br/>Because you're accumulating the damage dice unrolled, you can tell <i>generally</i> how badly you're hurt, but not <i>specifically</i> how badly you're hurt. This creates a powerful sense of risk in play. You can feel when the fight turns against you -- just look at all those big damage dice you're accumulating -- but maybe they'll roll well and you'll be okay! Or maybe they won't! It's your choice whether to stay in the fight, and you don't know how bad the consequences will really be, and you feel it right in the pit of your stomach.<br/><br/>At the end of the fight, you roll all your accumulated damage dice. For purposes of living and dying, we care only about the highest two: sum the highest two and set the rest aside. If the highest two damage dice sum to 20, your character's dead or dying, and there's nothing anybody can do. If they sum to 16-19, he's dying, but immediate medical aid could still save him. If they sum to 15 or less, he's hurt, maybe badly hurt, and he might need medical aid after all, but basically he's not going to die. Worth noticing: a 20 is possible only if you've taken a bullet, but a 16 is possible if your enemy's brought out any weapon at all. This is because Dogs in the Vineyard is a western, so guns are where it's at.<br/><br/>So here's you. You've seen a fight through to the bitter end. You've taken a couple of bullets but you don't know yet how bad they are -- I can say more about this if you like, some people choke on it even though it's very good sim -- and now it's time to sit down and pull open your shirt and see. You roll your big pile of damage dice, pull out the highest two, and...<br/><br/>...They sum to 20. This is, by far, the least likely result. A cool feature of the sum-the-highest-two mechanic is that no matter how many d10s you roll, a 19 is always more likely than a 20. The worse you get shot up, the more likely you are to die from it, but the more likely <i>still</i> that you'll cheat death by 1 point on the dice.<br/><br/>When you do get that 20, it's guaranteed dramatically appropriate, because you stayed in the fight when you knew the risks. If you'd wanted to be safe, you'd've run away when the guns came out.<br/><br/>...Or else...<br/><br/>...They sum to 16-19. You've cheated death for now, but here's the cool thing about 16-19: now it's somebody else's job to save your life. The old risk -- that you've gotten yourself killed -- becomes a new risk, and you feel it in your stomach <i>again</i>.<br/><br/>If there's no healer who can reach you in time, you die. Again, you knew it was possible when you stayed in the fight.<br/><br/>If there is a healer, now the healer has to roll dice to save your life. The odds are stacked on the healer's side, so again, narrowly escaping death is the most likely outcome, but dying remains <i>just possible enough</i> to make you feel it.<br/><br/>...Or else...<br/><br/>...They sum to 15 or less. This is the most likely outcome if you've taken only one bullet, or if guns never came out. In fact, if it's been a knife fight or something, 15 is to 16 as 19 is to 20: the most likely outcome of a gunfight is that you'll narrowly cheat death; the most likely outcome of a knife fight is that you'll narrowly cheat the possibility of death.<br/><br/>Whichever the case, you spend the whole fight acutely, viscerally aware of what you're risking, so that when the most likely thing happens and you cheat death, you feel like you've <i>cheated death</i>.<br/><br/>I'm happy to go into more detail if you're curious about any part of it, but that's how it works in broad.<br/><br/>-Vincent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_282074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282074/#Comment_282074" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-21T09:34:41+00:00" title="July 21, 2010  9:34AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That seems really, really cool, and I think I'll definitely have to check it out.

You keep fighting because things are happening too fast, and there's no time to do anything else.

There's no way to reduce Fallout, or shrug those dice away.<br/><br/>And the flip side is, you can see the stack of Fallout Dice building up on the other side as well.
