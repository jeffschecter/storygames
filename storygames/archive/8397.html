These portals do nothing to people, but they spit out cute little monsters like something out of a <a href="http://maplestory.nexon.net/WZ.ASPX?PART=/Main" rel="nofollow">Korean MMORPG</a>. In the decade since the portals opened, after the initial panic finally died down, hunting monsters has become a pastime for bored teenagers. They use melee weapons[1] (ranging from yard tools to museum pieces to decorative swords to stuff made by Nike and Adidas) to find and kill monsters, recover the valuable parts, and trade them in at the Monster Mart in the mall for money (though of course they're worth more if you take store credit). The hobby started with everyday people defending their homes, but nerds who wanted to play an MMO in real life have left it with a geeky flavor overall.<br/><br/>The default setting for the game is a small town somewhere in the U.S. My default would be somewhere in middle-to-southern California (one of those towns along or a little off of I-5 that I see when I drive to L.A.), but players are encouraged to set the game wherever they thing would be interesting, or somewhere familiar to them. My question is, what do you think monster hunting would be like in your neck of the woods, whether other parts of the U.S. or (especially) other countries?<br/><br/>[1]Guns are a little too effective against many monsters, and tend to destroy the valuable parts. Monster hunters are thus ambivalent at best about them, and like to have stupid flamewars on the internet about the subject all the time.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185523/#Comment_185523" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-31T15:25:50+00:00" title="December 31, 2008  3:25PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In Israel, 80% of the can/bottle recycling is controlled by organized crime. If you can do this for money, I don't see why organized crime wouldn't deal with this, or gangs (We don't have gangs here).<br/><br/>Also, if these portals are more permanent than "Open, spit, close", I'd see war over control of these portals. Scientists, military... especially when these things first come to being, and the government isn't too fond of releasing territory it controls, is it?<br/><br/>If these are actually dangerous, then how can teenagers with yard tools combat them? And if they're not dangerous, would I call them "Monsters"?<br/><br/>Also, with all the MMORPG players, I'd remove the "nerd" from it, and as soon as money gets involved, what would stop people who couldn't care less about MMORPGs from going hunting as well?<br/><br/>Also, if you take store credit, what does the store sell that you'd want? What do you do with these monster parts? The only thing coming to mind is like alchemical ingredients, but that actually work.<br/><br/>Also, for permanent and/or hassle/dangerous monsters, what about the portal location?

You're not supposed to point at it any more than you're supposed to punch holes at Pokemon. Ewen has also written about these things before, or at least some of them.<br/><br/>Then again, Ewen's mind is also obviously wandering - your game concept is so genre-referential that I don't know if mixing in real-world concerns like "how would this subculture look in your home town" is a good idea.

It'll be a farm-town phenomenon, essentially a childish version of hunting for moose, fowl and game animals. Considering the ages for teenagers who get into this (usually due to their fathers being hunters as well), I'd see monster hunting as something that would appeal to pre-teens and would be ridiculed by older teens. Somebody nearing 18 years would hunt real animals with a real gun, unless he got really invested in the monster hunting due to some unseen expert depth it had or something like that.<br/><br/>Also, we'd probably see a movement for monster rights among the teenagers. Essentially, they'd be split between the green, leftist monster rights advocates and the rural, right-wing hunting culture people. A strong gender split in this, of course. The geeks wouldn't care either way, they'd be too busy playing computer games and reading manga.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185528">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185528/#Comment_185528" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-31T17:31:07+00:00" title="December 31, 2008  5:31PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Most of the monsters are only really dangerous if people let them go unchecked or if they get too close to small children. They can at times burn, freeze, or poison crops and other plans, kill normal animals, and otherwise disrupt the ecosystem. They're right at that point where you can't totally ignore them, but unless you have a stationary portal, it's not quite worth hiring people to handle it professionally. (A lot of portals appear and disappear at different points around a given area, and don't stay in one place for more than a few minutes). There are actual dangerous monsters such as dragons, but they're very rare. The portals are too common for the government to have any hope of locking them all down, or even a substantial portion of them, though they certainly take advantage (or take precautions) where they can, especially on government land.<br/><br/>Monster Mart sells things like potions, weapons, holsters, etc., plus all kinds of monster hunting related merchandise. A lot of hunters keep a decent amount of store credit handy, because they buy healing potions, replacement weapons, magazines, etc. on a regular basis. You can convert store credit to cash; you don't get as much, but you do get real money. Monster Mart seems intent on giving people new ways to spend store credit and thereby keeping that much more of people's money.<br/><br/>Portal locations have had significant effects on places, good and bad. In Albuquerque, New Mexico the Winrock Mall (which in real life is an empty husk with one store) has a stationary portal, and Monster Mart bought it out and turned it into an indoor monster hunting park. It would not be anywhere near a stretch for there to have been people who lost their homes because of a portal, whether because of practical matters or eminent domain. Guy raises a good point that there are places where it would cause all kinds of strife, and I like the idea of American hunters occasionally seeing news reports about warlords fighting over portals, guerrillas fighting with monster parts, and so on.<br/><br/>You are right that non-geeks would get into monster hunting. It perhaps an unrealistic conceit of the setting that teenagers dominate monster hunting, but it's meant to be a game about teenagers, and to a lesser extent about issues with geek subcultures. In the setting there are monster-related TV shows that mix monster hunting with varying amounts of WWE, American Gladiators, and MMA, and there are some people who live off of monster hunting in one way or another, but they're meant to be the exception of the rule and (unless I decide to get into such things in a supplement) outside the scope of the game. By the same token, I could easily imagine monster hunting becoming a part of military service in some places.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>Most of that stuff is anime stylings, Guy.

Right now I have around 3-4 pages of setting info written up, and I don't want to go too overboard with that both for accessibility and because we're dealing with something that is at its heart unabashedly absurd.<br/><br/>For me working on the game and a novel, a big part of the fun of Slime Story is using it as a lens for pop culture stuff. In the novel I'm using changes in Monster Mart corporate policy to make fun of GameStop and its ilk, and hunters roll their eyes at that time on 24 when they did that thing with a salamander crystal, but by and large they love that Weezer song "Monster Girl" from the red album. This is also a game I want to get out into the world partly because I'm really looking forward to what other people might do with it, doubly so in terms of moving the action to Finland, Israel, Japan, China, or best of all somewhere I'd never think of.<br/><br/>Truthfully, I'm waffling on whether to include a section on monster hunting around the world, but looking at how it might be different in other countries will at the very least help me have some kind of answers to questions like Guy's, even if it's just with, "This is a silly game about teenage monster hunters, just go with it."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185530">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185530/#Comment_185530" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-31T17:31:52+00:00" title="December 31, 2008  5:31PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, since I went over the character limit in my last post:<br/><br/>In Japan, teenagers generally have to focus on college entrance exams as they get about halfway through high school, so I imagine monster hunting would become similarly a thing older teens look down on. Things are further and strangely complicated by the fact that owning guns or swords is against the law, and while the enforcement is apparently a little spotty, it's still very difficult even for an adult with a legitimate purpose to legally acquire a gun, much less a sword (and the LDP is looking to tighten up the laws even more). On the other hand, a lot of people will happily let kids play with wooden swords (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokken" rel="nofollow">bokken</a>). I don't know how much of it is real and how much is media portrayals, but there seems to be a cultural thing where kids in rural areas are very interested in nature, and boys especially love bug-hunting, with the big beetles being especially prized, and that could translate into a big interest in monster hunting. There would also be a lot of otaku monster hunters, and they'd make a nuisance of themselves by mobbing places in the countryside reputed to be good for monster hunting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185546">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JCunkle" title="JCunkle"><img alt="JCunkle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JCunkle">JCunkle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185546/#Comment_185546" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-31T22:09:04+00:00" title="December 31, 2008 10:09PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Neko, I want this game.

S. where hunting is a way of life.  I've been hunting since I was about 8.  It is a part of the culture here especially in small towns.  Lots of people revolve their lives around what hunting season is open.  They spent much $$ on all the things they consider necessary to make them good hunters.  So I could see monster hunting as no different from any other hunting except that you could get paid for it.  That would be a huge incentive for a lot of people.  Now as a geek I could also see monster hunting as a fantasy come to life.  It would be LARPing with real monsters to kill.  Sweet.  I don't think there would be any stigma attached in my neck of the woods.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to the game itself, I am interested in seeing it when it is complete.

Maybe Monster Mart lobbies Congress to pass the Slime Act (or some-such) that requires a license to hunt the Monsters (and Monster Mart is the only approved vendor for such licenses).  That way, Monster Mart markets to the teens and may even have age requirements for license validation (to match their target demographic).  <br/><br/>Also, guns would then be out for teens because teens can't get a gun permit for handguns and the license board (Monster Mart) can criminalize hunting with guns (because it cuts into their carcass profits).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185628">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185628/#Comment_185628" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-01T17:08:08+00:00" title="January  1, 2009  5:08PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: whiteknife</cite>I'd play it.

Slime Story is as much about character interaction and forming relationships as killing little monsters. Character advancement is based on accomplishing personal goals and making friends, so getting a girlfriend or finally saving up enough money to buy a car will do a lot more for you than killing monsters all day. (Though you can for example spend money from hunting monsters on trying to impress said girl).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: tomg</cite>From the Slime Story blog:<br/>"There\u2019s more\u2013possibly a whole lot more\u2013to squishies (the little slime creatures) than meets the eye."<br/>This is the most interesting thing to me.

Squishies are unusual among monsters in that they're the only ones that can actually reproduce (by binary fission). Because of this, one of the "Dangerous Monsters" in the book is a "squishy horde," basically a tidal wave of squishies overflowing everything. They don't quite conform to Earth biology as we know it, but they're something like single-celled organisms, despite being 4-12 inches across.<br/><br/>In the novel one of the \u201calchemists\u201d (a monster hunter who can make things with monster parts and use them in battle) starts discovering more and more ways to make different things with slime cores, including napalm, a chemical that attracts squishies, and a clean light source. There are also hints that squishies can absorb genetic and other kinds of information from other organisms, so that in very rare circumstances they can exhibit behavior that is much more sophisticated than usual.<br/><br/>In the RPG this will all just be something you'd have the option to mess with, but the novels are really living up to the \u201cSlime Story\u201d title.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wirebrain" title="Wirebrain"><img alt="Wirebrain" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wirebrain">Wirebrain</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185994/#Comment_185994" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-04T22:59:08+00:00" title="January  4, 2009 10:59PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Neko Ewen</cite><br/>[1]Guns are a little too effective against many monsters, and tend to destroy the valuable parts.

I've seen ground squirrels shot and left a reasonably intact corpse.(More than I'd say about a blow from an axe or a sword) After that, it's mostly a matter of local firearm laws, local towns might not permit firing in city limits and that minors in the US can't legally own a firearm (but then again swords would be right out too, due to "blades can't be bigger than a minor's palm" laws). <br/>BB guns, on the other hand could be seen as a weapon of choice for some hunters who'd rather slow down a monster than have it take a few swipes at him in close combat when he gets in close. The Red Ryder people could be making a killing. (no pun intended)<br/><br/>Anything above an air rifle or .22 caliber would be pure overkill.<br/><br/>I could also see licenses and "short safety courses", especially in California, regardless of what gear the kids use provided by the local Fish &amp; Game office.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thunder_God</cite>In Israel, 80% of the can/bottle recycling is controlled by organized crime.

War zones. More specifically, zones where there's enough conflict that civilian type people are more concerned with not getting killed by the people with axes to grind than dealing with cute overpopulation, or making pocket money.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake modern-day Baghdad (please!). I think during the early stages of the war and rebuilding effort, people would be too afraid to worry about the monsters. Eventually, they'd get to be a big nuisance, and the soldiers and insurgents would be too busy watching out for each other to really take care of it. Eventually, the soldiery (and maybe some of the larger, more organized insurgencies) would start offering bounties on these things. Guns of any sort, aside from licensed security personnel, would still be outlawed, so Iraqi teens would be limited to those melee weapons that aren't considered a big threat in modern-day warfare. They probably wouldn't care much about keeping the monsters intact. They'd care mostly about having something identifiable to bring in to the nearest outpost for the bounty. Eventually, as security improved and the infrastructure rebuilt, Monster Mart would follow McDonalds into Baghdad, and start taking over the bounty contracts from the soldiers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
