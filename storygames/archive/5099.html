This is a falling blocks puzzle game from the creator of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rez" rel="nofollow">Rez</a>, and what both games have in common is that they're very musically oriented, but they're not "rhythm action games" like Guitar Hero, Elite Beat Agents, Dance Dance Revolution, etc. It's more that they blur the line between music and sound effects. In Lumines there's a background music track, but everything you do with the blocks makes sounds that are smoothly integrated into the music. The music isn't the goal, but it's an integral part of the overall experience, and it makes Lumines more than a Tetris-wannabe (and Rez something other than a Tron-inspired Panzer Dragoon wannabe).<br/><br/>I've been thinking about integrating music into RPGs lately. I already play music from my iPod during most game sessions I run, but I'm wondering if it might be possible to make it a part of the game's actual <i>rules</i> in some way. It's tricky since the pacing of an RPG is generally dictated by the pace of conversation for those involved (another sacred cow to kill?). One of my RPG projects (Moonsick) involves scene cards being played on the table, and I could have a soundtrack prepared, and put a little icon with a track number on certain cards. I'm not sure how feasible it really is; for playing with my friends I could just make a playlist on the aforementioned iPod, but for a published game it'd get a little more complicated. Of course, what someone might do is take a well-known and widely available album (especially a concept album like The Wall or Year Zero) and integrate it into the core of a game. (Someone should organize a design contest...)<br/><br/>What other ways might one integrate music into a game?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_115200">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eldir" title="Eldir"><img alt="Eldir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i182.photobucket.com/albums/x208/loki_laufeysson/goplay_dotted_32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eldir">Eldir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115200/#Comment_115200" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-18T20:40:22+00:00" title="December 18, 2007  8:40PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting subject, especially since my friends and I are having a lot of fun putting together a soundtrack on my wiki for the game we're starting up next week.

If I had a <a href="http://www.zendrum.com/catalog.html" rel="nofollow">zendrum</a> or <a href="http://www.sweetwater.com/c645--Percussion_Controllers" rel="nofollow">midi controller</a> in the center of play, different players could reach over and hit various buttons to trigger different sound effects.  Players could even indicate their actions not by describing them ("I leap across the pit!"), but my hitting the "Jump" button, which would be super hot.  You could even work out a gesture-based resolution system (like in Shreyas' <i>Mridangam</i>) involving players trading sound effects or bits of music back and forth.  So play would be a bizarre cross between roleplaying and console gaming, because you'd describe stuff but also frantically hit buttons.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_115271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115271/#Comment_115271" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-19T08:25:22+00:00" title="December 19, 2007  8:25AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my current project, <i>A Flower for Mara</i>, the GM player (called the Director) has to choose music to open and close the game that reinforces the thematic content of the game.  I know that's not part of play <i>per se</i>, but I found that it was a powerful tool to set the appropriate mindset going into the game and then to provoke a certain type of reflection at the end.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_115306">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115306/#Comment_115306" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-19T09:29:41+00:00" title="December 19, 2007  9:29AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What if you go more free-form?<br/>Set your MP3 player up with a playlist that contains most/all of your songs. When something calls for a resolution, use the song's title, mood, and maybe even lyrics as inspiration for "what happens." Basically, it's <i>Everway</i> with songs instead of art cards. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
