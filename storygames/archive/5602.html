Boxing is definitely a martial art form. If you're looking for a story game manner in which to resolve the action of a one-on-one martial arts fight, then I think JJ Prince's Contenders, and even his <b>Piledrivers &amp; Powerbombs</b>, are two awesome current examples. Contenders doesn't hardly change at all if you take the boxing out of it, and replace it with something like MMA - or any other martial arts.<br/><br/>I also own the <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/8026" rel="nofollow"><b>Video Fighter</b></a> game, and it is totally a video game sim. Cute little game, but doesn't get out on the game table anymore.<br/><br/>The old WW's Storyteller game Street Fighter might also be worth checking out, if you're interested in a much more traditional look? In that vein you might even want to look at Palladium's Ninjas &amp; Superspies, perhaps along with TMNT.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_125603">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125603/#Comment_125603" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-10T14:59:44+00:00" title="February 10, 2008  2:59PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 10, 2008 3:01PM by John_Harper.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Burning Wheel</b>'s scripting has a great blow-by-blow feel. It works because the simultaneous scripting leads to a chaotic, frenzy of battle feeling.<br/><br/>And of course, <b>Riddle of Steel</b> has one of the most fun maneuver-based combat mini-games, ever. There are nice, juicy trade-offs in the maneuver selection, and then the moment-to-moment allocation of offense/defense dice adds a lot of tension. In RoS, the attacker retains the initiative (and stays on the attack) until the defender successfully turns the tables and the roles are reversed.<br/><br/>I'll add another vote for <b>Contenders</b>. It's fast, fun, and has just the right amount of tactics. There are no hard guidelines about when to stop narrating, but the card play determines who wins the round (and by what means), so you have a short-term end state to shoot for. When you hit that, you're done, and you do the next round.<br/><br/>EIDT: And Willow's forthcoming game looks sweet, too. Maybe she can stop by and give the skinny.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125850">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125850/#Comment_125850" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-11T14:53:10+00:00" title="February 11, 2008  2:53PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            More games that could port to RP and narration:<br/><a href="http://slugfestgames.com/games_eg.php" rel="nofollow">En Garde</a> (card game)<br/><a href="http://slugfestgames.com/games_kff.php" rel="nofollow">Kung Fu Fighting</a> (card game)<br/><a href="http://icehousegames.com/contest/icedes-5/IceFu/IceFu.pdf" rel="nofollow">IceFu</a> (pyramid game)<br/><br/>And it wouldn't be too tough to re-color <a href="http://www.gamecabinet.com/rules/WavingHands.html" rel="nofollow">Waving Hands</a> to suit martial arts instead of spell casting.<br/><br/>HTH;<br/>David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_125970">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125970/#Comment_125970" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-12T10:18:23+00:00" title="February 12, 2008 10:18AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Quite possibly my best martial arts experience was a game of Exalted, a duel in a burning airship hangar between two very wuxia inspired characters.  Pro: there was a lot of cool narration involving tricky maneuvers and using terrain.  (This was encouraged by Exalted's stunt system, which gives bonuses for just that sort of thing.)  On the downside, there was a lot of monotony in the actual maneuvers themselves, because when the magic swords are out, Exalted doesn't give you much of a reason to throw a punch or kick in there.<br/>(Watch any weapons duel in a Wuxia flick, like say Hero.  The weapons will get bound, and someone's going to do an unarmed strike.)<br/><br/>Mark, I think your question about narration is a little loaded.  The answer to that is going to depend on the narration rights predicated by the game, the narrative tendencies of the players, and how they interact.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
