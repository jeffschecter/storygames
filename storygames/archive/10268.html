I'm looking at the <a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/kids/books/step/" rel="nofollow">Step Into Reading</a> series of books by Random House for inspiration. According to their website, the series is designed to gradually get kids more confident in their reading ability. \n<blockquote>Step into Reading program is a unique leveled reader series that offers books at five carefully developed skill levels. This program offers a wide variety of fiction and nonfiction books. We have chosen topics of interest and colorful illustrations to make learning to read fun and exciting. Each step provides new challenges for young readers to master without being too difficult. The program is designed to give every child a successful reading experience- the grade levels are only guidelines; children can progress through the steps at their own speed, developing confidence and pride in their reading.</blockquote>\nThey split up books into five levels:\n<blockquote><b>STEP 1: READY TO READ</b><br/>Preschool\u2013Kindergarten<br/><br/>    * Big type and easy words<br/>    * Rhyme and rhythm<br/>    * Picture clues<br/><br/>For children who know the alphabet and are eager to begin reading. <br/><br/><br/><b>STEP 2: READING WITH HELP</b><br/>Preschool\u2013Grade 1<br/><br/>    * Basic vocabulary<br/>    * Short sentences<br/>    * Simple stories<br/><br/>For children who recognize familiar words and sound out new words with help.<br/><br/><br/><b>STEP 3: READING ON YOUR OWN</b><br/>Grades 1\u20133<br/><br/>    * Longer sentences<br/>    * Engaging characters<br/>    * Easy-to-follow plots<br/><br/>For children who are ready to read on their own.<br/><br/><br/><b>STEP 4: READING PARAGRAPHS</b><br/>Grades 2\u20133<br/><br/>    * More challenging vocabulary<br/>    * Short paragraphs<br/>    * Exciting stories<br/><br/>For newly independent readers who read simple sentences with confidence. <br/><br/><br/><b>STEP 5: READY FOR CHAPTERS</b><br/>Grades 2\u20134<br/><br/>    * Chapters<br/>    * Long paragraphs<br/>    * Full color art<br/><br/>For children who want to take the plunge into chapter books, but still like colorful pictures.</blockquote>\nHow would you re-define these levels in reference to story games? What are some foundational concepts that you think would need to be established in early levels before going on to later levels? Bonus points if you can think of five games and organize them as examples of each of the levels.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228215">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228215/#Comment_228215" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-27T13:28:27+00:00" title="August 27, 2009  1:28PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow. *bookmark*<br/><br/>This ain't gonna be easy....                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_228219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228219/#Comment_228219" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-27T13:40:10+00:00" title="August 27, 2009  1:40PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1.

Skills: Formal constraints, simple strategy, character versus player. Example: "Happy Birthday, Robot!", "Puppetland" (assuming an adult GM).<br/><br/>3. Movie-length games. Skills: Pacing, plot construction, trust building, more complex strategy. Example: Fiasco, Munchausen proper, Penny, Showdown. This is a well-populated tier of story games.<br/><br/>4. Miniseries games. Skills: Metaplot construction, deeper characterization, theme and premise, critique. Example: PTA, InSpectres.<br/><br/>5. Hard.

Kids start playing make-believe at very young ages, and not long after, start organically creating rules and adhering to them, etc. <br><br>I think this is a cool idea, and I think it's a good idea to write games to play with your kids (Shreyas and Vincent are big on this, I know). But I don't think the "Step into gaming" series is super necessary. It's less like reading and more like music appreciation; for some kids, their first concert is the Doodlebops, and for some kids it's Elvis Costello-- it's all about what their parents introduce them to and allow their kids to interact with and appreciate.<br/><br/>I know that personally, it's more likely that I'll help my kids play something I already love and feel is appropriate, even if I have to simplify it a bit first, and then once the girls show an interest and want games of their own, I'll go looking for kid-friendly games. But that's because I'm buying them and they'll come into any new kids' games with some amount of experience with the games I enjoy. I'd suspect that, since parents are the ones making the money decisions for kids, I'm not the only one.<br/><br/>Of course, what do I know? There might be a ton of hardcore gamers out there who'd be more interested in introducing their kids to the hobby, as opposed to specific games they like to play themselves. In which case, good on you. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228283">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228283/#Comment_228283" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-27T18:45:07+00:00" title="August 27, 2009  6:45PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul: I think he means kids.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DanielSolis</cite>I have a long-term plan to brand<i>Do: Pilgrims of the Flying Temple</i>and<i>Happy Birthday, Robot!</i>as part of a series that gradually introduce people (kids, usually) to story games. </blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_228299">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228299/#Comment_228299" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-27T22:05:00+00:00" title="August 27, 2009 10:05PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is all good stuff, but I'm wondering if there are content areas that can be gotten into as well as form.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228334">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228334/#Comment_228334" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-28T05:03:51+00:00" title="August 28, 2009  5:03AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hoho</cite>Shouldn't you be starting a Cub Scout troupe or Little League team or something?

In fact, I made some revisions to "Happy Birthday, Robot!" following that example.<br/><br/>Paul: I'm talking about kids <i>and</i> new gamers, presuming that anything that is designed to be playable by kids will also be playable by adults who haven't been exposed to story games.<br/><br/>And yeah, at a certain point even for "level 1," you do have to make certain assumptions: That the player is at an age where he or she <i>wants</i> more structure to their make-believe. That a parent is teaching their kids to get into the hobby, rather than specifically one game.<br/><br/>I suppose at the higher levels, I have to set some scope limits, too. Is this leading to specifically teaching you how to play an "advanced" game like D&amp;D or an "advanced" game like Spirit of the Century? That means I probably have to list out the core concepts that I'd restrict this series to, explicitly excluding stuff that is too complex to teach out of context or too unique to a single game. (Dice pools? Possibly. ORE? Probably not.)<br/><br/>Even with those assumptions, I know a handful of gamer parents who are itching to get any product that lives in the overlap between gaming, education, and parenting. I'm taking a bet that there are more out there, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_228378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228378/#Comment_228378" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-28T09:24:57+00:00" title="August 28, 2009  9:24AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh!

Making stories is hard. Not everyone - kids, the "masturbatory power fantasists" from elsethread, whatever - has a quiver full of techniques they're comfortable with, and a graduated scheme like this might be a good way to help them load up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_228537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon" title="lordgoon"><img alt="lordgoon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon">lordgoon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228537/#Comment_228537" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-28T21:27:28+00:00" title="August 28, 2009  9:27PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've actually been trying to do something like the same thing for adults, recently: I'm writing up a syllabus for a course in "interactive writing" that I'm gonna try and teach in a local MFA program, when the stars are right. Here's how I've been thinking:<br/>\n<br/>\nStep One: Think up alternate endings.<br/>\nTexts: "The Lady or the Tiger," the John Sayles movie _Limbo_<br/>\n<br/>\nStep Two: CYOA Games<br/>\nText: _The Cave of Time_ (the first ever CYOA children's Book) , _Life's Lottery_ by Kim Newman<br/>\n<br/>\nStep Three: Interactive Fiction Games<br/>\nTexts: A Mind Forever Voyaging, Photopia, and if I get really ambitious I might teach them the basics of a simple IF programming tool like ADRIFT<br/>\n<br/>\nStep Four: ST Games based on other Media<br/>\nTexts: Primetime Adventures, Pantheon<br/>\n<br/>\nStep Five: Utterly Original Storytelling Games<br/>\nTexts: Lyttony! (a game I'm designing - OK, shameless plug here), Universalis<br/>\n<br/>\nDon't know how close this was to the sort of thing you were looking for, but I'd be curious to hear any thoughts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228562">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228562/#Comment_228562" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-29T06:22:22+00:00" title="August 29, 2009  6:22AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that helps! I think Colin had a good idea in breaking down some essential elements common to a broad spectrum of story games and then organizing them into some kind of hierarchy of prerequisite skills. Colin proposes:<br/><br/>Active listening<br/>Reincorporation<br/>Metacognition<br/>Formal constraints<br/>Simple strategy<br/>Character versus player<br/>Pacing<br/>Plot construction<br/>Trust building<br/>More complex strategy<br/>Metaplot construction<br/>Deeper characterization<br/>Theme and premise<br/>Critique<br/>Tactics/strategy/operations<br/><br/>Somewhere in that list, I would probably include an introduction to the whole concept of a GM, which is somewhat unique to RPGs (unless you count referees in sports or parents who get called in to settle arguments over Monopoly).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_228659">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228659/#Comment_228659" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-29T23:17:33+00:00" title="August 29, 2009 11:17PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 29, 2009 11:18PM by ccreitz.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jeez, where's Jared or someone to tell me I'm way off base?
