It sounded (TO ME) like he was talking about it as an alternate to playtesting.<br/><br/>2) This:\n<blockquote>What is Playstorming?<br/><br/>Playstorming is our favorite way to make games at ISS. It works like this: One of us is too lazy to come up with a whole idea for a game so we play with whatever little we\u2019ve got. We think about what we want the game to do and develop rules as we play.<br/><br/>Our Playstormosophy:<br/><br/>From chaos, order is born. The playstormers should be ready to drop everything and immediately implement any changes that appeal to them. There should be no attachment to the flow of the game. Stop, change, evolve, enjoy. <br/>Each playstormer is responsible for their own fun. The game-bearer need not worry about entertaining the rest of us. Each of us will suggest the rules and modifications that we feel will make the experience more enjoyable for our own selves. <br/>To be a game-bearer is to be alone. The game-bearer decides which rules, if any at all, will ultimately be used. When putting together the final game, they are under no obligation to accept any of the suggestions previously playstormed. It is a terrible responsibility that they alone must bear. <br/>The new world after the storm. While the game-bearer is under no obligation to accept any suggestions, playstorming works best when everyone involved has an open mind. You may walk out of playstorming with a totally different game than the one you walked in with. That new game may be even more awesomer and beyond. </blockquote>\n(From the imagination Sweatshop page)<br/><br/>So!<br/><br/>Does the above deserve more unpacking?<br/><br/>How does it fit into the rest of the design process for a game?

Like, "I have an idea, but it's lonely and needs little idea friends so it can develop into a healthy adult idea." Or as a way to break you out of a rut. Like, "I have an idea, but I cannot for the life of me get this idea to work. Help!" It's not the entirety of a design process. It's more of a way to shake up your muse and get things flowing.<br/><br/>That said, we have in fact created a game from beginning to end in just a few playstorming sessions. We didn't know if it was possible when we started out, but used the convergence of Free RPG and JiffyCon as an excuse to give it a try. The end result was <a href="http://imaginationsweatshop.com/?p=36" rel="nofollow">Trial &amp; Terror: Supernatural Victims Unit</a>, our little game about <i>Law &amp; Order</i>-like procedural crime shows set in a <i>Buffy</i>-esque version of New York City. We sat down will nothing more than a sliver of an idea for that game, playstormed it three times, and ended up with something that surprised us.<br/><br/>I don't want to play favorites, because I dearly love playstorming, and I don't think I've had a rough time of it yet, but under the threat of torture, I might admit that my absolutely favorite sessions are the ones where someone brings the tiniest of ideas to the table and we start almost completely from scratch.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_156734">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol" title="Epidiah_Ravachol"><img alt="Epidiah_Ravachol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol">Epidiah_Ravachol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156734/#Comment_156734" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-15T13:24:22+00:00" title="July 15, 2008  1:24PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also!

That comes before (sometimes!) and after. Someone has to take responsibility for the game and shape the rough ideas you come up with into a jewel of a game.   <br/><br/>It's hard to put into words how fun the creative synergy is of playstorming. There's something about the fact that everybody is supposed to be giving feedback and giving ideas all the time.  It opens up and frees the process.  Playtesting, once you have a real structure in mind and want to see how it works, is a whole nother beast.  There when people say, "let's do it this way", someone has to damp them down and say, "no, really, try it the way it's written so I can see if that works." This is important, but it is a very different dynamic. You're getting feedback on your creative design when you playtest, playstorming is harnessing other peoples' creative energy. <br/><br/>The other big thing that you get is the immediate feedback on how an idea works.  You not only get lots of ideas, but you can then implement them on the spot to see how they feel in motion. That is very different from just thinking about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_156742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol" title="Epidiah_Ravachol"><img alt="Epidiah_Ravachol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol">Epidiah_Ravachol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156742/#Comment_156742" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-15T13:38:00+00:00" title="July 15, 2008  1:38PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 15, 2008 1:38PM by Epidiah_Ravachol.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Levi Kornelsen</cite><cite>Posted By: Epidiah Ravachol</cite>We sat down will nothing more than a sliver of an idea for that game, playstormed it three times, and ended up with something that surprised us.</blockquote>\nThat last time through - Did the changes to the rules get less and less?<br/><br/>Basically, as you went through it repeatedly, were you working from creating to polishing?   And was there any significant "tuning up" of the stuff after that, as you put it into the PDF in my other window?There was indeed a polishing process going on. <i>Trial &amp; Terror</i> is an odd one, though. Most of the time when we playstorm, the game belongs to one person. It's theirs to do with as they please. <i>Trial &amp; Terror</i> didn't turn out that way, and it ended being very much a group effort. Also, there was a time limit. There are plenty of avenues we didn't explore because we knew we didn't have the time. So when we found something that we liked, we let it be and tried tuning up the parts that we didn't.<br/><br/>After the third playstorm we added one rule to the game that we had not tried, and it was kind of a variant of a few rules we did try and reject. And then there was probably a little more tuning going on while we struggled over explaining what NYC's role is suppose to be, but nothing significant.<br/><br/>Since JiffyCon/Free RPG day, we've done a few actual playtests and blind playtests to learn a bit more and polish it up for a more final version of the game, but what we learned through that process is not in the PDF on the site.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_156745">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156745/#Comment_156745" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-15T13:57:46+00:00" title="July 15, 2008  1:57PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's useful to come in with very few ideas but lots of fictional reference to inspire everyone.

Playstorming was just something my friend Jim and I would do whenever we talked about the games we wanted to design. We'd be at some restaurant, one of us would mention some idea and before long all our dishes would be shoved to one side to make room for the dice, and we'd be frantically scribbling on napkins. Yes, we'd have dice and pens, but no paper. That's just how we rolled. And then about a year ago, I approached him and a few other friends about formalizing it bit. The ISS was born and we've been stumbling our way through it trying to figure it out as we go along.<br/><br/>What worked for us might not work for others and what didn't work for us might be the magic for others. That said, to do it as we did:\n<ul>\n<li>Grab friends who you know are interested in the design process. This was vital for us. Each playstormer is responsible for their own fun (which is a fundamental difference between playstorming and playtesting). If your friends just want to play, they might not enjoy the playstorming process.</li>\n<li>Keep in mind that you won't cover the same amount of story ground as you would in a regular game. As a rough estimate, we found that after playstorming for four hours (which was the limit of our endurance) we covered about as much story in the game as we typically did in one hour. Times vary, of course, but this can be surprisingly jarring if you're used to a well paced game.</li>\n<li>If something isn't working for you <b>stop</b> and figure out how to make it work for you.

We haven't had a real problem with this, but it's a nightmare I've suffered through in the past, where someone gives you suggestions about your game and won't take no for an answer.

I've always looked at this kind of thingas a way to extablish "our tradition of rules" for a single campaign, intended very much to be broken down into bits after it was over.</blockquote>\nThat Setting Session stuff is intriguing. Playstorming, as we do it, is far less procedural than that. I mean, you've basically quoted all the rules we have for it in the playstormosophy. So we don't have anything like the tokens used to determine who can input when. We do let the game-bearer reject ideas out of hand--it's just discouraged unless you know immediately obvious why you might reject the idea. So there is a filter there of sorts. But as the game progresses, it will build its own procedures.<br/><br/>To compare it to your freeplay idea as you describe it here, I think freeplay is more of a polishing technique than playstorming.<br/><br/>Where freeplay might be:<br/>Gamer A: "Hey, I've got these square pegs. Let's figure out how to fit them into our round holes."<br/>Gamer B: "Let's shave the corners off them!"<br/>Gamer A: "Awesome!"<br/><br/>Playstorming is more of:<br/>Gamer A: "Hey, I've got all this scrap lumber that I want to do something with."<br/>Gamer B: "Let's make pegs to fit in our holes!"<br/>Gamer A: "Awesome!"<br/><br/>It's still hole-stuffin', any way you look at it; but the playstorming will probably occur much earlier in the process than the freeplaying.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_156819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156819/#Comment_156819" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-16T01:13:35+00:00" title="July 16, 2008  1:13AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Epidiah Ravachol</cite>Gamer A: "Hey, I've got all this scrap lumber that I want to do something with."</blockquote>\nFor no reason I can name, this makes <i>perfect</i> sense to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_156962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol" title="Epidiah_Ravachol"><img alt="Epidiah_Ravachol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol">Epidiah_Ravachol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156962/#Comment_156962" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-16T12:19:17+00:00" title="July 16, 2008 12:19PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Levi Kornelsen</cite><cite>Posted By: Epidiah Ravachol</cite>Gamer A: "Hey, I've got all this scrap lumber that I want to do something with."</blockquote>\nFor no reason I can name, this makes<i>perfect</i>sense to me.<br/>Whew.

So he just made up some as best he imagined them to work from what he'd heard. Mugger games were a later development out of this).<br/><br/>So anywho, the way it workd early on is that the person presenting this minsi wargame basically created thesituation and laid things out, then players took turns saying what happened with their guys, sorta freeform style. The presenter acted as a ref, with input from all players. In any case, if events seemed to call for it, they'd make up mchanics on the fly or use simple random die rolls ( a bit like in 1001 Nights) to decide between differnt choices.<br/><br/>Presumably, precedent, at least within the game session itself, also affected later stuff.<br/><br/>One notable difference, from what I can tell, is that th Mugger Game guy ( Paddy Griffith) wasn't inherently trying to playstorm something into existence that would later form the basis for a recordable and repeatable game exactly. My personal impression is that each session/event/whatever was it's own thing.<br/><br/>Here's a page worth looking over:<br/><a href="http://www.wargamedevelopments.org/Wargame%20Developments%20Handbook.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.wargamedevelopments.org/Wargame Developments Handbook.pdf</a><br/><br/>You'll find it alphabtically                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
