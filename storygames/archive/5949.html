I want to talk about the flip side here.<br/><br/>Tell me why the dungeons were built, besides "ooh its a crazy mad wizard! He's CRAZY! He builds dungeons!"<br/><br/>I'm not talking about extensive natural caverns. I'm talking about worked stone, doors and traps, magical fountains, whatever. Tell me why it was built in the first place and whether that relates to what its doing now. <br/><br/>Example (feel free to expand/riff on this):  Dungeons are Real Estate.<br/><br/>1) Dungeons as Housing Projects.  When the elves got sick of watching man destroy the forests, they took over. Men live in poverty, and elvish experience has shown that if allowed to roam the surface, men will cut down any tree they come upon. So it became necessary to make dwellings for man beneath the earth, where he could perhaps do less harm (or, at least, bother the dwarves instead). So massive underground communities were built, housing thousands of humans and other "disadvantaged humanoids". Officially, it's all still governed by the elvish authorities, but in practice they rarely set foot down there unless they have to.  Or to buy drugs - turns out the creatures of the deep underground make some seriously powerful stuff that some elves are addicted to. Men and the other creatures eke out a living selling Liquid Darkness, hustling, and doing whatever they can. <br/><br/>2) Dungeons as Middle Class homes: Like industrial loft conversions, only underground. Now they're well-lit, spruced up a bit, and convenient to the center of town - just go up! Some folks really get into the spirit of living in a converted dungeon - trapsmiths make good money restoring old traps and making them non-deadly but elegantly functional so they can be shown off.  In a few centuries, the irony is that these will fall into disrepair and become true dungeons like the ones they were inspired by.<br/><br/>What makes building a dungeon economically viable?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_132965">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WillH" title="WillH"><img alt="WillH" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v488/Telpierion/minitardisicon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WillH">WillH</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132965/#Comment_132965" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-06T12:10:30+00:00" title="March  6, 2008 12:10PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 6, 2008 12:11PM by WillH.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            They attract well armed and equipped adventurers.

First of all, for some reason you've got caves. Maybe it's like our world, where caves happen naturally in certain areas. Maybe there are Dwarves down there buidling cities, abandoning them, and filling up the world with little nooks and crannies of underground adventuryness. Maybe there's a whole underground world of interconnected caves spanning the world.<br/><br/>And there's treasure. The Dwarves mine gold and make it into stuff. The Dwarves get overrun by monsters, or trade with their neighbors. Loot gets distributed.<br/><br/>And down there things live: communities of goblins breeding like flies, big monsters that eat them and keep the population down, organized communities of Drow, Dwarves, and whatnot. Sometimes one of these things even gets powerful enough to impose some order on the chaos. There's a complex society and ecology churning away in the deeps.<br/><br/>And sometimes its spills over into the world. A particuarly successful goblin tribe starts raiding farms for food, and maybe taking money. Adventurers are a peice of this ecology. They go down into the earth, kill some of the monsters, shake up the ecology. Sometimes they come out with a giant heap of wealth. Sometimes they die, and whatever they brought with them becomes part of the underground economy.<br/><br/>Actually, (shameless plug coming) <a href="http://planet-thirteen.com/Dungeon.aspx" rel="nofollow">I made a game based on this very idea</a>.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_132969">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132969/#Comment_132969" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-06T12:28:05+00:00" title="March  6, 2008 12:28PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 6, 2008 12:29PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another take on real estate:<br/><br/>Building underground is a colossal undertaking; there's no possible financial return on your investment.

I've sorta punted the question and answered a slightly different one:<br/><br/>How might dungeons come about other than being dug out by crazy surface mages for hidey purposes?<br/><br/><b>Borne of the Earth</b><br/>The massive world of underground labyrinths was built by creatures who did not have a choice: they were not surface dwellers. They escaped from another plane through a portal that led to a giant cave deep in our earth. It was not enough area for them to survive so they expanded it, using spells to disintegrate 10-foot cubes of rock at a time to craft passageways and rooms. Perhaps they died off eventually, but excavators stumbled upon the ancient tunnels.<br/><br/><b>Tunnel for Power</b><br/>The earth is a source of great power. The deeper you go, the stronger this power is. Sorcerers talk of a dead god who is trapped at the center of the Earth. Even as he slumbers, his power can be tapped by those who understand the forbidden, arcane ways. Close to the surface, it is hard to dig tunnels. One must enslave the humanoid races to do the backbreaking digging. As the tunnels get deeper, magic makes the work easier. Get a few thousand feet down and the tunnels almost dig themselves. Of course, the magic there comes alive, too, and it can manifest all kinds of horrors that man was never meant to know.<br/><br/><b>Buried Cities</b><br/>Ten thousand years ago, the world was covered by vast cities of unimaginable beauty. Their builders' prowess enraged the jealous gods, who cursed the stone buildings to sink into the ground. Today, little is left of that civilization. It has all but disappeared beneath the soil. The tallest buildings of the ancients might still poke out of the ground, though, and brave souls might venture down there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133022">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133022/#Comment_133022" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-06T14:59:59+00:00" title="March  6, 2008  2:59PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So assuming that the incentive is economic: <br/><br/>Mining: Dwarves hollow out immense mines looking for mithril (which is valuable enough to make huge mining operations viable).

Where the hierarchy of sin builds from an adventurer deciding they're not going to adventure, but instead make money some other way, and there always being horrible consequences.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133059">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133059/#Comment_133059" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-06T17:46:17+00:00" title="March  6, 2008  5:46PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Burr</cite>The world opens and closes like a flower.

My point being that I really don't like handwavey magic (I tried to indicate this briefly above). Instead I like it to have a complex cosmological reasoning that informs the belief systems of the inhabitants of the world. So if such exists, there has to be a reason why it exists. And people's beliefs about the reasons would be an important part of play. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhy are you going down? To be closer to the dead god? To eventually free him one day? If you do, do you believe that you will attain apotheosis yourself? Or immortality? Or does this unlock the afterlife? The orcs believe that it will cause the end of the world that will end the eternal suffering that is life. What does your character's culture say? Does your character buy into that? How does his beliefs manifest in terms of worship, or his own magic? <br/>\n<br/>\nI could go on, but you get the idea. I don't want to give folks the idea that my solution is "Because magic makes it cheap." That's just the surface explanation. Underneath there has to be an understanding of what this does to the cultures involved, and how that informs their interactions. Which is, after all, the real meat of fantasy. In my opinion. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133356">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133356/#Comment_133356" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-07T15:41:07+00:00" title="March  7, 2008  3:41PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I find most plausible (involving least straying from familiar reality) the directions of:<br/><br/>- The dungeons are buried ruins, perhaps built by ancients with phenomonal skills such that they survive, cities under the sands in desert settings, consumed by the jungle in others, blending with the Conan "cities of green stone" concept for example.<br/><br/>- Earthdawn's example of dungeons as the "bomb shelters", for example a world where every 2000 years there is a decades' long event that makes surface life untenable for civilized humanoids (but doesn't wipe out the ecology) thus resulting in the creation of immense living quarters with water and some effort at life sustaining techniques.<br/><br/>Unless it's the "one off megadungeon with unique explanation", a good plausible explanation requires that campaign world/backstory support the dungeon.

The mechanics of smuggling arms into<br/>Gaza have been documented widely. At any one time, there are between 10 and 30<br/>main tunnel shafts underneath the border. Wealthy families in Rafah, called<br/>\u201csnakeheads,\u201d finance tunnel openings to these main shafts in either their private<br/>homes or rented properties. The \u201csnakeheads\u201d then rent their tunnel openings to<br/>independent gunrunners or members of Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and Fatahaffiliated<br/>militias, who are then responsible for moving guns and goods from Egypt<br/>into Gaza. When a tunnel is completed, the primary investor and his/her relatives are<br/>entitled to a percentage on every shipment passing through it. Packages of arms and<br/>ammunition are pulled by cables and electric motors through the tunnels, which in<br/>some places reportedly reach depths of between 50 and 60 feet in order to avoid<br/>detection.</blockquote>\nI don't know how the term 'Snakeheads' arose, but I think it's fascinating, and if I ever use this idea there will definitely be Snakeheads involved.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_188825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188825/#Comment_188825" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-17T11:21:09+00:00" title="January 17, 2009 11:21AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 17, 2009 11:26AM by David_Berg.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Edited to delete what I wrote.
