The story isn't almost entirely dependent on the GM and players are doing much more than just occasionally reacting to the GM. RPGs that give players control over their character and nothing else are becoming boring to me; I just feel like the players are not involved very much and it's too much of a one man/woman show. What are some Contemporary RPGs that have more collaborative Story Game elements, but would still be considered RPGs in the sense that the focus is still on advocating for a character from their POV? Or, more simply, what are some RPGs that give players more to do and GMs less to do...that are collaborative to a degree  but still character driven?  I know PbtA and Lady Blackbird have a bit of this going on, what other games involve players more regularly?  Perhaps there are even games with mechanics that more regularly involve players but not necessarily in the story building sense? I guess the cyclical nature of PbtA games would qualify? Anyway, thoughts?

The reason I got rid of them is because I thought they were like other mainstream systems that I'm tired of, being that I generally prefer Indie RPGs and Story Games; also, I don't have much time so if I'm going to get into a heavy system needs to be worth it. Can you go into how heavy the system is and can you detail the aspects of the game that more heavily  involves players. What do players add to the story that they don't in other games? If you could compare the heaviness to other games and go into detail about how the players are involved I would greatly appreciate it <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459745">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459745/#Comment_459745" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-30T04:30:22+00:00" title="January 30, 2017  4:30AM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I mean, if you're allergic to involved rules then you might not like FFG SW. Personally I found it only got *too* clunky for my tastes when dealing with the rules for upgrading gear; fortunately you can kind of leave that in the players' hands, and the game functions fine if everyone just wants to stick with normal gear.<br/><br/>But the big thing it does that's super cool is that every roll generates a certain number of Successes, Failures, Advantages, and Threats. Successes and Failures cancel one another out, so if you roll 5S, 2F then you've succeeded by a margin of 3. Same with Advantages and Threats, but what they day is move the story along through introducing unforeseen complications or twists, whether beneficial (if Advantages win out) or deleterious. There are also Triumph and Despair results, which roughly correspond to "Crits" in other systems, but these are appropriately rare.<br/><br/>So, the thing is, a dictatorial or (ironically) less confident GM might just try to narrate all outcomes himself, but the real idea is for the players to be able to suggest where things are going based on the results. (Margin matters, too: success by 1 looks very different than success by 3, and a Threat of 1 is very different than a Threat of 5. This is only really codified in combat, but groups are expected to develop a consensus on just how good / bad a particular result is.) Now, I will say that I've ended up GMing the game a lot for players who are less confident taking the narrative reigns, for the most part, so I do end up making a lot of suggestions, but I always give the players the option to interpret the dice for themselves in terms of what is happening in the fiction.<br/><br/>PCs can also spend light side destiny points to gain either a bonus to a roll or a slight narrative advantage, like the old "bale of hay beneath the window you just jumped out of" trick. What's especially neat is that you never run out of light side points, exactly, because every time you spend one it gets flipped over to the dark side and the GM can use it. I spend them like candy when GMing because I want the PCs to have them available most of the time, and because I don't want *them* to hoard.<br/><br/>The Flagging is also really great, especially because every character has both an internal and an external motivation. (It's a little different in the Jedi one, where pretty much everything is internal, but this makes sense for that part of the setting.) The books are written in such a way that it seems like the GM is sort of supposed to have an "external" plot, but like most Flag-based games, it's really pretty easy to just base everything around the PCs' own stated interests.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459755">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459755/#Comment_459755" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-30T17:50:32+00:00" title="January 30, 2017  5:50PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jeff,<br/><br/>Also, all of my games qualify (oddly enough, except for the one you've played!
