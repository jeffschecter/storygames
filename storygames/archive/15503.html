We make up a story together, our invented truths springing from the cards we hold; and they step into the unknown, pausing at every awkward touch, hopeful despite everything to come.</blockquote>\nThe new draft has incorporated the feedback gathered from play at Go Play NorthWest, CozyCon, Geek Girl Con, the Self-Critical Hits podcast and other various instances of play and conversation.

What we did in the first game would be impossible now, actually, according to the rules.<br/><br/>The first time, we were poking around in the basement when I narrated the door upstairs creeping open and a bunch of people coming into the house. We locked the basement door but, in a few minutes, the folks who'd arrived in black SUVs were sawing through the lock with a police-style forced entry bolt-cutter.  So we ended up all jumping into the machine and being transported to the white city, where everything moved in a strange blur and dark monkey-like shaped darted about the rooftops.  That's when we discovered that going to the white city doesn't really work, because the player with that card is constantly narrating.  But it was kinda surreal and Narnia-like.<br/><br/>The last time we played, my character went out in the backyard and dug up some wires leading from the machine to somewhere else (another house?). We went next door and found that the neighbor's house contained a huge miniature model of the white city spread out everywhere, on counter-tops and tables.  Then, when the other characters turned the machine on, it ended up causing one character's palms to start bleeding and ultimately killed him.  So that game had much more of a dark psychological horror feel.<br/><br/>It can go in a bunch of different directions, but, ultimately, the actual "plot" of the narrative matters a lot less than the interplay between the characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_352930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352930/#Comment_352930" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-02T00:04:20+00:00" title="January  2, 2012 12:04AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We went to the White City both times I played. I can see how it's possible to avoid that, but it feels like the whole game pushes you in that direction.<br/><br/>We did run into difficulty with one player having to narrate a lot. That issue is exacerbated if you split up, because then you lose a lot of opportunities to seize or pass off narration. But it did seem to <i>mostly</i> work out via the ability of a player to give up the City narration if they were stuck. Also, we found that if you're astute about the bounds of the narration authorities you can distribute narration while in the City at least a bit more evenly: whoever's in charge of the Teacher gets say in all aspects of the Teacher's story, which can often pertain to things that happen in the city.<br/><br/>Caveat: I haven't read the new version yet, so I don't know if any of this is addressed further.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352947">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352947/#Comment_352947" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-02T05:56:56+00:00" title="January  2, 2012  5:56AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What was the machine for you guys?

So there's no going to the White City all together, though one or two characters could leave as long as someone stays in the house.  That's how we played it when my character went into the backyard or when my and Jackson's character went into the neighbors' house.

For players who think tactically, it gives them an incentive to do something the game wants you to do, and I don't think it messes up the game too much.  However, Jackson seemed to think (and maybe I'm misrepresenting him here, this is just my recollection) that you weren't really intended to <i>actively describe</i> stuff on your card -- like when I had the black SUVs show up -- but, rather, only answer the questioned posed to you about your subject by the other players. That makes it less of a "reward" to have a certain card -- because you can't actively narrative an interesting idea you have, only what people ask -- and I think it makes the tactical pursuit of other cards less likely.  Still, I can see attempting to have characters touch when you feel like you're "done" or creatively exhausted with the cards you have and want something fresh, but that's a different thing and (I think) something that's more in keeping with Jackson's original intentions.<br/><br/>I haven't played the game yet in the "only answer questions" mode, but I'm really excited about what that'll do to the game and I'm interested to try it out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352971">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352971/#Comment_352971" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-02T13:30:44+00:00" title="January  2, 2012  1:30PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, yes. I think the games I played had a SORT of "only answer questions" practice in effect. Basically, when you were messing with the machine, or the city, or whatever, people would be aware that player X was the only one who could make authoritative statements, so they'd ask her questions constantly. It essentially boils down to GM-like authority constantly vetted through the other players, which tapers off as you run out of questions to answer. Once the Machine-narrator establishes sufficient operating procedure, or the City-narrator carves out a sufficient space to play around in, you don';t need to rely on them except in special cases--trying something new, exploring a different area.<br/><br/>We weren't really strict on that, though...I'm prtetty sure the owner of a narration card would supply information without an asked question from time to time.<br/><br/>The real issue I've found in play is with the Narrator card, the holder of which answers questions about the characters' past and relationships. Both times I played, the second time especially, it was kind of hard to get this role revved up, because players simply didn't ask many relationship questions. The few that DO get asked mostly come at the beginning, to get a relationship sketch roughed out, then the role gets sorta dropped. I've held the Narrator card for large chunks of a game somewhat desperately wishing for the other players to ask me questions or otherwise give me a pretext for detailing relationships or past history. The role COULD be a robust means of exploring the personal side of the friendships throughout the game,, via flashbacks and piecemeal revelation...but it's hard to spotlight that in play.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_352979">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352979/#Comment_352979" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-02T15:50:35+00:00" title="January  2, 2012  3:50PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joel, the narrator role is pretty different now, due to the issue you mentioned (it pretty much only came up relatively early in the game).

I almost wish it was impossible to go to The City in the game, though I would hesitate to insert that preference into the game, even if I were facilitating or introducing it, because any constraint on the nature of The City seems antithetical to the game's premise.<br/><br/>But IMO the whole point of the City is that it is inaccessible.<br/><br/>I also agree with what Joel said about the Narrator card in the original draft -- I like the new version a lot better, on paper. (And not just because Jackson changed it based on my feedback.) It remains to be seen how it will work out in play. But to me, the rotating voice-over is a pitch-perfect emulation of the sort of YA genre that the game plays off of.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352987/#Comment_352987" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-02T17:05:26+00:00" title="January  2, 2012  5:05PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            how did the fates came into play in your games? <br/><br/>did you make them happen as part of the story or were they a kind of addendum in the end, a quick snapshot in the future of the characters?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_352991">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352991/#Comment_352991" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-02T17:47:01+00:00" title="January  2, 2012  5:47PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I think the new rules are pretty good for the city: you can go there, but you can't ALL go there, which makes it only part of play and not the central focus.<br/><br/>We had a big discussion about fates after the last game too.  I tend not to look at them much until the game's over.  Other players (and Jackson) seemed to like viewing them as foreshadowing the future, but there were some concerns about driving in the direction of one fate, switching cards, and suddenly having what you were doing before not match with the fate you ended with.  I don't think that's a big issue, but it does require players to be less deterministic in their framing of certain sorts of events (like their character dying, especially).  In practice, some epilogues seemed to emerge pretty naturally from narrated content and some seemed more tacked-on after the fact, but in both cases we had a mix of those in the two sessions I played, never all one and all the other.  It's possible that has to do with the nature of some of the fates?  Not sure; needs more evidence.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_353002">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353002/#Comment_353002" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-03T00:47:43+00:00" title="January  3, 2012 12:47AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, clearly I need to shut up in this thread until I sit down and read the new version.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_353003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353003/#Comment_353003" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-03T01:38:16+00:00" title="January  3, 2012  1:38AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ice Cream Emperor I almost wish it was impossible to go to The City in the game, though I would hesitate to insert that preference into the game, even if I were facilitating or introducing it, because any constraint on the nature of The City seems antithetical to the game's premise.<br/></cite></blockquote>\nYes.

You don't have to come up with a whole plan, let alone a REASON for why the machine (or whatever) is doing what it's doing, or why it exists. You just have to describe the next logical thing, answer the question directly. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ivan</cite>why did you decide to tie in the narrative-authority swap mechanics with the touching?</blockquote>\nI wanted the game to hinge around touching, for the players as well as for the characters. Contact is very important to me, and i believe it's important to most humans... thinking back to my teenaged years, when touch was a big social step and was never guaranteed, well, i wanted to put that in this game. Since the narrative-authority mechanics are the gamiest part of the game, game-gamers (part of my audience; in the venn diagram, most of the people who play silver and white and also post on these boards would count as game-gamers: they come to the table to push buttons and unscrew things and watch the mechanics work) would enjoy engaging them. Thus.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ivan</cite>What about the accepting/refusing the touch?</blockquote>\nThere are lots of games about doing a thing. I'm interested in games about responding to a thing (when the thing being done is done by another player). This pushes the players to examine their characters a bit, and it also makes statements about your character if you make a choice based on strictly mechanical reasons. <br/><br/>For example, if i want to make sure i retain the Machine card, then i'll have to make sure i get to choose which type of cards we exchange, which means i have to knuckle under to whatever your character is doing, or else behave warmly to them.<br/><br/>I don't think this is the best way to do either of these things, but it is a way. I am excited for the games that will do this better, in the future.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_353299">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman" title="Ross_Cowman"><img alt="Ross_Cowman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2VVx8Kc--zY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACZ8/3Pco6NeJ4Ng/photo.jpg?sz=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman">Ross_Cowman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353299/#Comment_353299" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-06T09:42:34+00:00" title="January  6, 2012  9:42AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "There are lots of games about doing a thing.

That's just the human brain, &amp; connecting dots.

I think the game initially orients the players towards making the mysteries wrap together (the photos &amp; machine in the same room is a powerful connecting device, separate from the game mechanics), but leaves it open enough that on a second or third play you may find that the game is more open than you initially thought it was. I do think most people, "gamer" or no, when they play it for the first time will naturally weave everything together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

must be a connection</i> and that <i>the connection must be resolved in play</i>. Not assumptions that are at all unique to gamers, of course; but I do feel like the belief in narrative resolution is maybe a little overdevelopped in our games and community at large.<br/><br/>I mean, when I played, and I had the photographs* card, I also answered questions in a way that suggested a connection between the machine and the photographs. (And therefore, indirectly, the city.) I'm not trying to be all like 'avoid the obvious at all costs!' But actually travelling to the city is IMO a much more significant problem for the game, in terms of both themes and narration-rights-distribution.<br/><br/><br/>* Notice incidentally that it's not called 'the city card.'                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_353446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353446/#Comment_353446" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-07T22:38:37+00:00" title="January  7, 2012 10:38PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ice Cream Emperor</cite><br/>Nothing really specifies that the machine takes you somewhere?</blockquote>\nMy assumptions laid bare!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_353452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353452/#Comment_353452" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-08T03:08:05+00:00" title="January  8, 2012  3:08AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Daniel: But it <i>was</i> called 'the city card.' recent change.<br/><br/>Celebrate this with me: i believe we've just hit the structured freeform equivalent to, like, "but if i'm astride my mount i get a +4, so if both my mount and i are lying prone &amp; i'm suffering a -4, shouldn't the modifiers cancel one another out?"<br/><br/>that's actually not what i mean at all, but now i've fallen in love with that fake example of munchkinery so i'm leaving it.

I think it's a great leading-on, if you know what I mean. It leaves you there with your assumptions, and your assumptions take you where you will. Maybe someone else's assumptions will surprise you.

So I said, I would play none player characters just to get things moving. (I did play the Shadow man)<br/>\n<br/>\nInterest was ok, some of the group grabbed a card or two as we were chatting and blurted, what\u2019s this feeling card stuff?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I explained about the rule when characters touch within the game these cards are exchanged. \u201cWow what the fuck, who\u2019s touching who here\u201d was a valid response which got lots of laughs.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, we got down to reading through the book, which was fine. The setting, theme didn\u2019t meet much enthusiasm, being teenagers male /female and using touchy feely cards got A response like \u201cthis doesn\u2019t look good for four guys!!! and you no we cant take this serious.\u201d<br/>\nOk I said \u201chang in there its got a good set up\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\nLike I said the intro went good, passing the rules around to each player to read. Character creation was fine, maybe some of the explanations of rules were hard to verbalize? (Reread once or twice)<br/>\nIntro of characters to each player was done in a mixture of in character and out of character. The rules I think don\u2019t determine which, so a bit of confusion was met here.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the player with the Narrator card set the scene, it had the desired effect and all were quickly drawn into the story.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe story unfolded with the cards in full swing, when it came to areas of responsibility the guys would look to that player for his dialogue.<br/>\nThe relationships surfaced many times along with the details not rubbed out at character creation.<br/>\n<br/>\nCard swapping happened genuinely a few times but did reduce near the story end to a fight for the card with the epilogue, which someone wanted most.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe timer was used but only got to Sunday pre dawn.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe story itself involved the Teacher disappearing, the machine emitting a white flash making those in the vicinity of the cellar disappear into the City.<br/>\nThose in the city experienced, a dark 1920 feel, with ash or carbon dust in the streets or on the trams they entered.

(Created by the player with the City card.)<br/>\nTelephone conversations, (Ceated by the player with the Machine card. He said telephone cables went into the machine, which prompted a player to call numbers in the teacher\u2019s personal telephone book.<br/>\nAlso a shadow figure, which had melded with the teacher in the City and separated on there return to the house.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Do you remember which rules tripped you guys up? And was a re-read enough, or did you end up putting the rules in your own words, to better communicate them?</b><br/>\n<br/>\nHard to remember this one, But the one I can remember which tripped one player up and another had to explain in his own words was, On the part which says,<br/>\n<b>If you have the Machine card, start here.<br/>\nUs kids can\u2019t see the future. But if we knew, what could we learn about who we are, about what we must be willing to do, since these fates will come true?<br/>\nThink about this yourself for a moment.</b><br/>\n<br/>\nThe player reading it, was confused had to re-read it. Maybe a bit deep? Or the bit written,<br/>\n\u201c Since these fates will come true? he said \u201cis this a time travel game.\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso placing names and relation ships on character sheets got a bit mixed.<br/>\n(The unlikely crush). Players were in debates who had the crush? We settled on the arrow pointing, suggesting the character with that sheet had the crush on the named in the box.<br/>\nLooking over the sheets, player and character names were put in the wrong areas (dotted outline/ under line) or not in boxes at all but above them. This could be due to the layout rather then players? But my mates are untidy sods.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was generally your normal stuff when learning new rules. Everyone hears or interoperates differently.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>I'm interested to know what the epilogue was. Which one they were fighting over,</b><br/>\n<br/>\nThe card epilogue,<br/>\nI will betray one of these friends for incredible riches.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe players character sheets what I care about,<br/>\nWealth. Myself.<br/>\nRecognition, knowledge, myself<br/>\n<br/>\nNote: One player crossed out two instead of three,  Greedy sod!<br/>\nBut in his defence would it be better to just say how many to cross out?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso the player who got the Epilogue betrayed his sister shoving her off the tram as they were leaving the station for the light. <b>Sibling Sister</b> and one of his details <b>My parents prefer my sister to me</b> he then inherited the family fortune.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Finally, i'm interested to know if you could tell me more about how it felt "educational".</b><br/>\n<br/>\nHmmm I did try to get them to spill the beans on this,<br/>\nOther comments were \u201cthis would be good for kids who are dealing with these issues with feelings and such.\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose Story games dig down into such stuff like (Feelings, change with personal depth not experience points.)<br/>\nMy group might find that too personal or just plain uninteresting. Ignorance is bliss.<br/>\nI\u2019ll try to bring this up next week. Get back to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I forgot to say last post,<br/>\nThey game play was roughly 80% in character 15% Dialogue and 5% Out of character discussion about things like, players authority of their card area or where the story was going.<br/>\n<br/>\nThings were accepted quite easily with no fuss and where the story was going didn\u2019t loom its head!<br/>\nIts amazing, thinking back how in the game they were,,,,for say 2.5 hours.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps.

It was great fun. The new rules are tightened up and delightfully refined from those I played last.<br><br>I played with Abi, Bryan and Michael (our very own Stupidgremlin!). I had not read the new rules prior to play, so it was a fascinating journey of discovery.<br><br>I'll say this straight-up: the other players, through NO influence from me I SWEAR, immediately established that the machine transports you to the city. One player injected some doubt about that, like maybe it just atomizes you, but "the machine transports you" was the default assumption throughout the game, and it turned out to be true in the end. However, the game did NOT end up being about exploring the city. Only one character went there, and it was at the end, and we only got the barest idea of what happened to her there. So it felt like the hushed, terrifying mystery of it all was nicely preserved.<br><br><i>I</i> played <b>Marlene</b>, shy and straight-laced girl who cares about belonging and knowledge. She loves her little bro Pritchard but tries not to show it, and has a super-secret crush on Andi.<br><br><i>Abi </i>played <b>Andi</b>, a brash bad girl who cares about knowledge and herself. She's total best friends with jared, and oblivious to Marlene's crush. Indeed, she's kind of oblivious to Marlene in general.<br><br><i>Bryan </i>played <b>Jared</b>, a cocky thrill-seeker who cares about recognition and wealth. He's partners in crime with Andi and acts as a rival to Pritchard, pushing the sensitive younger boy to measure up to his standards of devil-may-care badassery.<br><br><i>Michael </i>played <b>Pritchard</b>, a timid and high-strung boy who's stuck hanging out with his sister's cruel friends, and cares about belonging and knowledge. He 's sensitive about death, can't stand Jared's constant teasing, and seems to want support from his sister that he seldom sees.<br><br>In play: <i>Andi and Jared got drunk on the teacher's booze, and were excited about trying to figure out the machine, just for the thrill of it. Marlene wanted to share their madcap adventure but kept saying stupid, cautious things that made them despise her. Pritchard was freaked out more than anyone about the presence of death, and wanted to put the teacher properly to rest. Marlene got fascinated by the unearthly photographs, and in finding out more about the teacher's sad, lonely life. She managed to pull Andi into this fascination, and they discovered together, but never quite connected the way Marlene hoped. They found the teacher's last will and testament in the unopened letter: to be placed in the machine, along with all the photographs, and sent away.<br><br>Marlene wanted to fulfill his wishes, but couldn't bear to lose the photographs. She convinced Pritchard, in the name of honoring the dead, to help get the teacher into the machine. Andi thought that maybe the teacher came FROM the other world of the photos, and wanted to go there. While she and Marlene were alone in the basement, she convinced Marlene to operate the machine and send her. Pritchard saw the whole thing from the top of the stairs, and Marlene told him it was for Andi's good, and made him swear not to tell Jared. It was well past dawn, and they fled the house, the photos secretly tucked in Marlene's satchel.</br></br></i><br><br>Their ultimate fates: <b>Marlene </b>became a celebrated surrealist photographer, living a bohemian lifestyle in Paris (<i>envied by untold numbers, but understood by none</i>). <b>Pritchard </b>became chef and a front-runner in a TV cooking competition, but committed suicide before the show concluded (<i>die during my attempt at something great, and be celebrated posthumously</i>). I honestly don't remember what happened to <b>Jared</b>, which is appropriate considering his Fate card (<i>comfortable and forgotten</i>). <b>Andi </b>appeared years later, in another small town, and began a a quiet life as an eccentric and reclusive photography teacher, building a strange machine in her basement (<i>I will never get it back, though it will haunt me well</i>).<br><br>*****<br><br>I love love love the new categories of cards: "thinking cards" and "feeling cards." Very simple, direct, instinctive even. And having a moment-to-moment prompt for what your character is feeling has much greater impact on play than only having a "fate" that you're somehow "playing toward." Bravo.<br><br>I also really dig the way character relationships are assigned. Nice and simple, and a neat dealie where your choice impacts which Fate you're playing with. And the single sentence about deciding which items on your sheet your character keeps secret really excited us. We had great fun deciding which parts of ourselves we were hiding from our friends ("I love my brother? Yeah, I'm TOTALLY keeping THAT secret.")<br><br>The change in the Narrator role from "describe relationships" to "give first-person, present tense voice-over" is brilliant. It still covers the fleshing out of relationships, but it's expanded to be broader than that, and particularly usefully, it gives you a concrete, easily understandable narrative device to do it with! It's a device that's fun to try out for even minor things, leading you to "practice" with it a lot more, whereas I found the old Narrator didn't get used very much beyond the first ten minutes of play.<br><br>The rules for time passing are BRILLIANT. It's easy in this type of game (certainly in every time I've played S&amp;W) to just "play straight through" a linear sequence of unbroken time, no scene breaks or editing. The rule that when someone decides to cross off a time period, the Narrator places the friends in the house (and in different locations!) is a nice way to gently force scene changes and (even more importantly) solo activity and private, possibly intimate conversations. We did, however, show a tendency to under-use the power at our disposal; often we'd end up only "cutting" a few minutes ahead, beginning the scene with "so here we are doing the thing we had just set out to do before the time shift." Maybe the mechanic could use some refinement or clarification that pushes more toward larger leaps and moving the story forward?<br><br>Some things we struggled with in play:<br><br>I found it awkward getting into the read-aloud portion of the book. I knew it was coming, but the first few pages didn't mention it. I read the flavor text of page 2 and page 4, then found the read-aloud instructions on page 5. Then I had to ignore the instruction on page 8 to go back and read page 4. <img alt=":/" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/confused.png" title=":/"/>  I'd appreciate some clarification, and putting the read-aloud instructions as up-front as possible.<br><br>Once we got into the read-aloud it went pretty smoothly, with a wee bit of confusion at the "don't read the italics" stuff, quickly smoothed over. I really like numbering off 1-2-3-4 and reading the social contract around the table. It felt very equalizing and bonding. Though I did notice that, as I happened to get the Narrator card, I did a lot of the talking in the next part. I understand the reasoning behind giving all the first person intro to the Narrator, but it felt like my voice was being given unfair weight, exacerbated by the fact this was "my" game I was bringing and facilitating in the first place.<br><br>Some players were confused by the instructions on the Thinking cards. When asked to read the Thinking card text aloud, they sometimes only read the top section, thinking the bottom part was something unrelated. And the wording of the instructions threw off a player or two. Like, when it says:\n<blockquote>Ask questions in your character's voice or to clarify what they perceive...<br><br>About what the photographs of the city of the city show, what it must be like there, and at what price we could get there.<br><br>About how the machine works, how to operate it, and what it does.</br></br></br></br></blockquote>\nAt least one player couldn't make the connection between "Ask questions" in one line and "About" in the next two lines, requiring explanation from an experienced player (me) on what their duties actually were.<br><br>Also, while as I noted above the Narrator is much improved, I still find there's a timidity factor to overcome in making use of the Thinking Cards fully. The Machine is probably the easiest: someone messes with the Machine, and the bloke with the Machine card's on duty. The photographs are similar, but not as much to explore about them (at least not as much OBVIOUS), so they tend to fade from play a bit. (I had Marlene go over to look at the photos deliberately because I noticed we hadn't really used the Photographs card.) The teacher is a bit easy to forget about because well, obviously, he's dead, and he's not a cool machine to fiddle with, and you have to really consciously strive to have your characters investigate his life.<br><br>Which is all to say that I find myself wanting some way for the rules to nudge us more strongly to exercise our Thinking Card duties in general.<br><br>We encountered some uncertainty regarding the lines of authority on describing our environment. Like, "create fiction freely, except..." seems clear, until you start wondering: "well, really, this is the Teacher's home, so EVERYTHING in the home is about the Teacher and must be answered by the holder of the Teacher card." After awhile, we kind of stopped making up environmental details freely at all, instead deferring to the Teacher cardholder for practically everything that wasn't the Machine or the Photographs. Not sure how to demark that productively; I mean, some stuff, like searching through the teacher's papers in his desk drawer, DO feel like they fall under the Teacher card, but I'm not keen to see people asking permission to describe EVERY little thing in the house.<br><br>*****<br><br>Anyway, all in all it was a marvelous game with new friends and old. Thanks, Jackson, and good luck on the new revision!*<br><br>Peace,<br>-Joel<br><br>*Which, dare I hope, might be accompanying you to Gamestorm in a couple monjths? <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_357269">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357269/#Comment_357269" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-01T22:01:34+00:00" title="February  1, 2012 10:01PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Totally heroic amount of feedback, Joel! <br>This comes at the best possible time, you are a gleaming star. <br><br/>Thank you!                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357279/#Comment_357279" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-01T23:09:09+00:00" title="February  1, 2012 11:09PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_357439">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357439/#Comment_357439" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-02T17:56:07+00:00" title="February  2, 2012  5:56PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm a terrible playtester, but maybe some of this is useful. I hadn't read the game when I played it.<br/><br/><b>What I didn't like:</b><br/>The read aloud parts were awkward. I find it hard to understand when things are read to me in general though, so maybe that's just me. I didn't like having to read out loud either. I couldn't concentrate and immediately forgot what I read. I had to peek at the rules during the game to figure out what I was supposed to be doing.<br/><br/>I like the way play begins, but I felt some character motivation was needed. When we were supposed to start playing there was an awkward silence of about 20 seconds where we just looked at each other. In the end I used one of my wants (money) and went in search of valuables, but it didn't feel very satisfying. I would have loved to have somewhere on my character sheet say: ''This is why I break into houses'' or ''This is why I'm at the photographer's house'' or ''This is why I hang out with those guys.''<br/><br/>The ''what I care about''s were a bit too generic for my taste. I guess I need a bit of hand holding in my games, I don't have a lot of experience with rules-lite games.<br/><br/>Setting wise, I didn't care about the silver city. I would have preferred a version where we just get the machine and nobody knows what it does. This is a pet peeve though, but maybe it crossed your mind too at some point.<br/><br/>It needed more feeling cards. I think it would have worked better with more active/direct/teenage-y feelings, like anger. <b>Confused </b>was very lukewarm.<br/><br/>Fates getting switched around was kinda weird. If I remember correctly one player had ''I don't care about money'' but last minute he got ''I betray my friends for a big payout'', which felt weird.<br/><br/><b>What I liked:</b><br/>I really liked the touching rules. It really works with the teenager angle and is just pure genius. <br/><br/>Liked the machine a lot. Gave me lots of ideas in-game and out. It's a great set up.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>It did a lot of things very well and I liked the game a lot, which is why I have so many opinions about it.

If we tried to stop it it would have felt like blocking. <br/><br/>The machine has a door in its belly for Christ's sake, where are we supposed to think that door goes?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_358702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358702/#Comment_358702" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-10T11:12:59+00:00" title="February 10, 2012 11:12AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 10, 2012 11:13AM by jackson_tegu.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well said, Jaime.<br/><br/>I don't want to punish people for not blocking their co-players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_358751">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358751/#Comment_358751" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-10T14:52:11+00:00" title="February 10, 2012  2:52PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would have loved for there not to be a silver city, just a machine in a basement.<br/><br/>Oh, Jackson, where can we get the playtest version?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_358758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358758/#Comment_358758" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-10T15:31:42+00:00" title="February 10, 2012  3:31PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 10, 2012 3:32PM by jackson_tegu.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wait, you don't have it?
