The type of game we play is scaled above character-driven RPG - so a story about an event that has characters, but they are secondary to telling a complete event. Examples of this can be found on the record of our plays, here: http://shichitenhakki.wordpress.com/ Our most recent efforts have been using the Slipstream commercial setting, using out own rules. But I see no reason why the tools we have developed could not work for other applications, which is where I would appreciate your help.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow part of the tools developed that I would like to invite you to test, is a table. This is a table to which you propose questions to which the answer could be yes or no. It cannot handle complex questions such as 'what happens if'. This table incorporates the ideas from several games and pulls them together into one lookup. You formulate the question (for example, does the bridge collapse when the explosives go off), decide the probability of the answer being Yes (ranging from Million to One, to Shoe in), then roll two d6 (of different colours so you get a result ranging from 11 to 66).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe wording is deliberately pulpy. The odds are not literally a million-to-one. That's the way we like it. Thoughts on this? <br/>\n<br/>\nThe table will read out variable results. Yes and No, obviously. But also Yes/No And - additional benefits or penalties, Yes/No But - a result paired with an opposite effect (Yes the bridge does collapse, but it crashes onto a passing ship), and Yes But Only If - something story-significant happens (Yes the bridge did collapse with the explosion, but the blast also killed the current central character).<br/>\n<br/>\nShould this sound as if it fits your story-telling style and you would like to try the table, please drop me a line. Also, if you do, please post up your findings here.<br/>\n<br/>\nAndrew                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_316491">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bottlesorter" title="bottlesorter"><img alt="bottlesorter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bottlesorter">bottlesorter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316491/#Comment_316491" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-13T20:07:39+00:00" title="March 13, 2011  8:07PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 13, 2011 9:59PM by bottlesorter.">edited March 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Future tools coming, including the card decks we have developed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_316504">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whduryea" title="whduryea"><img alt="whduryea" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v220/Nugan/noose755.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whduryea">whduryea</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316504/#Comment_316504" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-13T22:37:44+00:00" title="March 13, 2011 10:37PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I feel like maybe we need a single playtesting request/resource thread. Right now we have a number of threads by developers looking for playtesters, and several outstanding offers to playtest or critique work-in-progress games. It would be nice to see all of this brought together in one place. It would reduce clutter, and make it more likely for these two groups to find each other.<br/><br/>Or does a thread like this already exist somewhere?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
