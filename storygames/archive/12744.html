Like a lot of our previous controversies (the "why isn't the community supporting me by buying my game?" meltdown of 2006-2007, for example), I think this one has been a long time in coming, following the exodus from the combined Forge-IPR booth after 2007-8 (?). Are these the continued ripples of that or the beginnings of some larger change?  Hard to know yet, perhaps.<br/><br/>For examples of  this general trend, there's:<br/>-- a few threads about booth stuff on SG: <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=12722" rel="nofollow">Selling at GenCon</a>, the <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=12729" rel="nofollow">First-Timers Area</a>, and the <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=12735" rel="nofollow">GPA program</a> <br/>-- some conversations about sales <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23s&amp;Mode=like">#s</a> in <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=12717" rel="nofollow">the Design Matters thread</a><br/>-- Chris Chinn providing a wider historical perspective <a href="http://bankuei.wordpress.com/2010/08/14/not-a-marriage/" rel="nofollow">over here</a><br/>-- Elizabeth <a href="http://blowback.twoscooterspress.com/2010/08/more-gencon-why-selling-at-ipr-during-the-con-was-a-mistake-for-me/" rel="nofollow">over here</a> (EDIT: check out Rob's response, too) and <a href="http://blowback.twoscooterspress.com/2010/08/con-sales-at-ipr-the-response/" rel="nofollow">followup</a><br/>-- Vincent and friends <a href="http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=526" rel="nofollow">over here</a> and conversations <a href="http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=528" rel="nofollow">mentioned here</a><br/><br/>Another major concern seems to be Games on Demand and in general better integrating GoD/IGE into the overall indie games experience at GenCon.  This has also been a perennial topic, even back when Kat Miller was running it every year and things seemed somewhat more organized.  I would venture to suggest that the indie publishing community loves the idea of strengthening both on-site and future sales through supporting play at conventions -- in addition to enjoying playing games with each other -- but hasn't ever really settled on a model that feels really optimal.  Honestly, this may be something that is always under inspection and revision, just like publishing / distro / marketing / convention methods, in an attempt to keep making it better or suit current needs / trends.<br/><br/>Threads on GoD are popping up:<br/>-- <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=12684" rel="nofollow">here on SG</a><br/><br/>There's also the annual discussion of the ENnies and indie games' role in awards, but I'm not sure we've really said anything new there this year.  Am I wrong?<br/><br/>In some ways, it's interesting that none of these conversations seem to happening on The Forge, at least yet.  Another sign of shifting things, perhaps, or maybe people are waiting to post more thoughtful responses when they get a chance.<br/><br/>What about other folks?  What themes are you hearing or pondering?  What conversations did you seem to have more than once?<br/><br/><i>A small request: can we try to talk about the conversations that are happening without trying to argue with folks or blame them for having these conversations or concerns?  I realize a lot of this stuff is potentially controversial and involves money and status and all that crap.  But it would be nice to be able to check the pulse of the community on various issues without having this degenerate into a mess.

The biggest issue I remember, from conversations at GenCon, was how to critique games effectively.

I'd been pretty cynical but I think the things they say they want are actually things they want at this point. So that's cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
