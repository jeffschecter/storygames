You've been playin' games and takin' names. Hopefully at least one game, perhaps more.<br/><br/>What was your most favorite character you played in the last six months?<br/><br/>I've played a bunch of games, most notably campaigns of <br/>Savage Worlds (Multi-Dimensional Conspiracy)<br/>Marvel Supers (Annihilation)<br/>Apocalypse World<br/><br/>I think at this time my favorite character is Sunset, an indonesian (at least, as far as anyone can tell) Battlebabe from Apocalypse World who wears cargo shorts, flip-flops, a heavy hanten jacket, and carries very long knives and a rifle for when things get fun. I like that she's passionate, a hard heart for justice, and very competent about bringing it about. She can sway folks (+2 Hot!), but also easily swayed herself. Fiercely loyal to her friends (all the characters are female), fatalistic but optimistic, and hell-bent on making sure the just are rewarded and the unjust put in the ground.<br/><br/>How about you?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410592">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410592/#Comment_410592" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-27T12:56:19+00:00" title="March 27, 2013 12:56PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Finbarr Cailean, a cleric of Cayden Cailean, the drunken god of bravery, travel, and liberty.

He was a stand-up comic / dirty-limericist at the big taverns in the city, very likeable, and a good ol' friend of one of the PCs. He came to her for help, because he'd swindled his brother out of a lot of money, then his brother had gotten a big gang together to shake him down, and he had to borrow the money from The Blue (the Icon dragon that runs Drakkenhall) to pay back his brother, but now The Blue wanted his money back, and well, you know.<br/><br/>Not yet a character in an actual game, just a character in my head: A wizard who had a ritual go awry, and he swapped places with his familiar. So he likes to fool people who come to him for help. His old cat familiar now walks around the tower in human (wizard-robed) form, and occasionally licks his arms and chases mice and eats them, but also answers the door and confuses people. I mean, he has at least average intelligence. The actual wizard is stuck in cat form, and amuses himself by studying visitors and how they treat him as an animal. He'll communicate through his familiar-in-human-guise as long as possible. If he reallllly trusts you, he'll let you in on the secret, and then you have to parlay with a hyper-intelligent, talking cat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410603">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ColinC" title="ColinC"><img alt="ColinC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ColinC">ColinC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410603/#Comment_410603" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-27T14:15:32+00:00" title="March 27, 2013  2:15PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In our Archipelago III 'Isles of Amma' game I'm playing...<br/><br/><b>Dasa - Second scion of House Akan</b>.

With his Heart Of A Dying Star he obliterates all those before him, and uses its pulsing power to rise from the grave when he finally falls. When the star goes out, he will not rise again.<br/>He's also in charge of the training of new recruits. In Sunday's session, he also absorbed the essence of a shadow demon he vanquished, so we'll see where that goes.<br/><br/>As an MC, I'm also very fond of one of my NPCs in Apocalypse World, a leader of a cybertech cult named Rex.

I'd have to say my favourite this last semiennia would be from Andrew/Pheylorn's Star Wars World game, my character "The Gand Of The Kell Of The Gand". Or Kell, for short. I came in to the campaign a couple sessions late and they'd kicked it all off with a very heady and deep bang, so I was somewhat left behind on the deep plot front. Nobody's fault, and if I'd cared I'm sure we would've fixed it. Anyway, Kell came in with a past reputation for being a decent Mr. Fix-it (jury rig move), and was largely the comic relief. Through some Ikea "How do I have these parts left over I swear I put it together right" madness, Kell ended up establishing a workspace/infirmary, as well as gained deep political ties through the great Kell family ("What great Kell family? I've never heard of them." "Ahh, yes, well, they are best known for ruling Kell Spa- I mean Hutt Space. By which this Gand means the Hutts rule Hutt Space. There are no Kell. We did not have this conversation. This Gand has things to fix.") even though Kell never proved worthy of a first name, and barely was allowed to use the family name. <br/><br/>Eventually, Force-Powered Gand-bots were the order of the day. As befits dramatic structure, being the common fool, Kell was the only character to rise from nothing to great power and not be destroyed by ideals. A nice point of hilarity in an otherwise rather dramatic run.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/semajmaharg" title="semajmaharg"><img alt="semajmaharg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/482/n0TRVVHW3SOVY.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/semajmaharg">semajmaharg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410637/#Comment_410637" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-27T18:43:59+00:00" title="March 27, 2013  6:43PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Honestly?

I'm still sore I failed to persuade her player to continue her story in our subsequent game of Monsterhearts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410645">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WPTunes" title="WPTunes"><img alt="WPTunes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/193/nI9P6PIU22T8F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WPTunes">WPTunes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410645/#Comment_410645" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-27T19:42:03+00:00" title="March 27, 2013  7:42PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Really, my only choice is my Halfling rogue in a D&amp;D 4E game.

Henry Chayefsky is one part amateur sportsperson and Throwball (rules unspecified) fanatic, one part fire/ice mage with a tower shield who throws magic curve-balls, and four parts huge beard &amp; gold teeth. He's the first character I've played that even tries to be "heroic", and in that regard it's a lot of fun. Blasting things, speaking sports metaphors, almost killing myself in an attempt not to lose my shield, charging into situations with no regard for the finer details of the plot and a possibly misguided feeling that everything is going to be ok. I didn't really think that I was ever likely to enjoy playing a quasi-superhero in a medieval fantasy hodge-podge, especially after D&amp;D, but Henry and the universe he inhabits has been real enjoyable Saturday morning cartoon fare. He got real mad when the main villain cursed him and his beard fell off. It's broken a spell of my thinking that the only good roleplaying is emotionally challenging, metaphorically dense roleplaying, and I think I'm better off for it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410668">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TotallyGuy" title="TotallyGuy"><img alt="TotallyGuy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TotallyGuy">TotallyGuy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410668/#Comment_410668" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-28T01:40:42+00:00" title="March 28, 2013  1:40AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 28, 2013 1:41AM by TotallyGuy.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rufus Wedderburn, a portly man who couldn't decide between becoming a politician or a wizard.

Simultaneously arrogant and dismissive of the deserter knight Thorne, yet at other times maudlin and openly lamenting how he's never actually got the chance to see any action - never drawn his sword on a man, unlike Thorne who fought, suffered and returned with nothing. It was great fun to play into those contradictions. <br/><br/>He bullied innocents, blew his chance when brigands did attack - spending the whole encounter on his back in a brook, unable to right himself in heavy armour - and was convinced that one day, he would have a part to play, and find his honour by the sword.<br/><br/>And he got it, of sorts, starting an order of 'plague knights'  on murder missions to clear out the infected hiding in the woods. His honour was killing unarmed old women and children, mind, but he was doing it for god and the king, so that was ok.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
