Being stuck in a pattern of thought. Thats the only arena where brain damage in relation to rpgs makes sense to me, at any rate.<br/><br/>So traditional games condition gamers to think in certain patterns,and this force of habit is hard to break; but breaking it can be fruitful, in that it opens up new vistas of enjoyment and fun.<br/><br/>The norwegian game design trend is tearing itself away from numbers and resources. Games are being designed to revolve more and more around <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3144" rel="nofollow">improvisation and cooperation</a>, and less around competition and resource management. <br/>This has got me thinking.<br/>The indie-culture as a whole seems very focused on the same things rpgs have always been focused on: Numbers, resources and competition.<br/><br/>Now Im asking this: <br/>Is this a form of brain damage? <br/>Does this focus (I would say overfocus, but thats just me) on rules and system, and manipulation of the two, remove fokus from the very core of roleplaying: Play?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76115">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76115/#Comment_76115" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-16T13:41:16+00:00" title="June 16, 2007  1:41PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Hm.

Sometimes system is that, sometimes it's "you perform this role and i'll preform that role," something it's something else.   System, as a purely abstract concept, is just codification.<br/><br/>Now, for me (and this is just about me talking here), game design is about that codification -- it's analogous to writing codes of conduct or a computer program, in that you're trying to detail classes of behavior, action and reaction.  Whether that's "I roll to hit and...miss.  Darn!" or "As the Prince, I'm trying to woo the Peasant Girl.  Her motivations on the sheet are to save her her father from the dungeon &amp; also to marry her true love, the blacksmith's son.  Let's go!"<br/><br/>Some people may see number &amp; points as the ultimate expression of roleplaying, but I don't think that's the general consensus (if there is one) of the indie design movement.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Temple" title="Temple"><img alt="Temple" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b340/kreutzer/ubt.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Temple">Temple</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76125/#Comment_76125" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-16T14:24:12+00:00" title="June 16, 2007  2:24PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But is system the only way to access those dimensions of play?

If you have issues with the stuff people have been saying over at Knife-Fight, please try to engage the people there.<br/><br/>That said, I disagree with your conclusion for a couple reasons. First, ALL improvisational systems utilize structure---aka system---to varying degrees. I've written an article for <i>Push</i> on the topic, and I could share it if you want. The deal is that most of the structure in traditional improvisational systems is implicit and/or informal. This gives the impression of "free-form" or near "free-form", but most improvisation is actually very structured. RPGs can utilize overt system---aka mechanics and all that---because they don't have an (traditional) audience to impress. I view this as an advantage. As system influences play, the fact that RPGs can utilize structures that normal improvisational systems can't, means RPGs can produce fiction that a more "traditional" improvisational system can't. That's the long way of saying that I think your distinction between "improv &amp; cooperation" and "numbers &amp; resources" is a false dichotomy.<br/><br/>Second, you're wrong in saying that "most" indie rpgs are obsessed with resources and numbers. In the better indie rpgs, mechanics serve to focus play. Are you familiar with the idea of the Fruitful Void? The basic idea is that the heart of play, the thing that really matters, the thing that players are really obsessed with, is NEVER systemized. Rather, the rules focus play on that "void".<br/><br/>A great example is resolution in DitV. It's a common misperception that resolution in DitV is "about" resource management, even though it does involve resource management. The purpose of rolling all those dice is to limit PC action. Because PCs have a limit, they have to choose vary carefully what they are willing to fight, and what they are willing to let go. If the GM raises with, "I shoot the innocent bystander", the player has to decide whether its worth blowing all their good dice on saving the bystander, or whether its more important to let the person die in order to win the conflict. In other words, the resolution system forces thematic decisions, not tactical ones.<br/><br/>[edit] <i>Cross-posted with a couple people</i>.

(I hope it's not a train.) I see these indie games wich have rules with dice and poker chips for who is having GM fiat and rules about the structure of the story regarding the characters, and I think: Man. This is like a club for amateurish fanfiction writers. (No offense, I'm a wannabe writer myself with not much success.) It's like it wouldn't be _roleplaying_, but how to write a story that has the structure of the genre this and that.<br/><br/>When I'm roleplaying I don't wanna get bonuses for narrating correctly. I want to make decisions in another world in someone else's boots. And I don't want to know nothing about story things and GM things. I want to have moments when it really becomes hard to decide what to do because of ethical and moral things. And it really won't help, if I know what it means mechanically.<br/><br/>I think rules light is not a sollution for this, but maybe rules devoid or how would you say. It's not that the rules should be simple, but the rules shouldn't cover some things. (Is this the fruitful void? Dunno.) I want to roleplay. I want to seduce noblewomen.<br/><br/>Temple, is that what you mean?

Otherwise you wouldn't be <i>damaging</i> people, you'd just be changing them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe brain-damage thing is saying that people who like one sort of story are natural and healthy, whereas people who like another sort of story are damaged goods.  I don't buy that, and I don't think many people here <i>do</i> buy that, so why are we discussing things in those terms?<br/>\n<br/>\nY'know, I'd be <i>perfectly happy</i> to have a discussion of conditioning and training, and what gets learned on an explicit level vs. what gets learned on an implicit level.  I just can't go there if we're going to blithely assume that there's no meaningful difference between that and brain damage.

The terms are not to be used, because everyone will jump on it. Use your own words instead and noone will say that "it's not this and that". Sure, they will throw you links to the closed Forge forums saying "We speaked it over it's old stuff, and it's called like this." or saying "Hmm, interesting, it's similar to this term." But you will get more meaningful responses and less "This term doesn't mean that."<br/><br/>So, don't forget: the terms are there to not to be used.

Humans have been conditioned through millions of years of evolution to enjoy play, puzzles, and challenges. If someone has an innovation in game design that breaks the mold, by all means they should bring it forward. If people like it, they'll play it. If not, it is not due to any damage.<br/><br/>Player on Player conflict is can be good and bad. When its good we call it competition. When its bad, its annoying. When its really bad, its an argument.<br/><br/>Character on character conflict (in the absence of conflict between players) is really cooperation. The players are cooperating to create adversity for each other in the shared fiction. It can also be both good and bad. When its good, its character development. When its bad its a distraction.<br/><br/>Good and bad above are defined by what it does to the game that the group is playing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76187">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Temple" title="Temple"><img alt="Temple" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b340/kreutzer/ubt.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Temple">Temple</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76187/#Comment_76187" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-17T06:38:44+00:00" title="June 17, 2007  6:38AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My use of "good" and "bad" were just to illustrate my position with regards to your example.<br/><br/>Of course I realise that not all playervs.player conflict is "bad," and not all character on character conflict is "good," objectively speaking.<br/>I do think, however, that what you call competition is not a neccessary part of roleplaying.

There's a lot of conditioning when it comes to language use.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76240">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Temple" title="Temple"><img alt="Temple" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b340/kreutzer/ubt.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Temple">Temple</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76240/#Comment_76240" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-17T13:36:52+00:00" title="June 17, 2007  1:36PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            True.

If you're after Socratic deconstruction of conventional thinking, using it might have a point, because you'd want to invite such a spirited discussion to surface and override preconceptions.  Otherwise, "brain damage" is distracting to the point you're trying to make.  To the extent any learned behavior becomes rigid enough to increase the difficulty of adopting or even apprehending alternative behaviors, it's legit to bring up conditioning.  But I don't think you can't call mere opportunity cost "damage" per se.<br/><br/>I had a boss once who liked to chastise people using terms like "you fucking moron," but when people got pissed, he'd say he wished people would just hear his words as "content neutral."  What he meant was just what you appear to say above, that people should somehow ignore the denotative and connotative meaning of a term and look at the speaker's intent.  However, I think you have to pay attention to the actual language being used, especially when that language happens to be polarizing.  Intent is also important, but to get to the intent you have to interpret the language being used and the paralinguistic cues involved.  Since we don't have face to face interaction here, raw text has to carry a lot more water in conveying meaning.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76242">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76242/#Comment_76242" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-17T13:43:37+00:00" title="June 17, 2007  1:43PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Temple</cite>I find it rather odd that people cant look past the words to the meaning underneath...</blockquote>\nWhy would they bother?<br/><br/>That's not a jab, that's a real question.

There's basically been two responses:<br/><br/>1. No, and <br/>2. I don't like the term brain damage<br/><br/>The term is highly charged and was used in the context of RPGs to slam a whole group of folks. So, the reaction to the term is understandable and since the concept of brain damage is not central to your question, why not just chuck it?<br/><br/>You pretty much do that in a later post with the suggestion that when you say brain damage we should hear the more value neutral term conditioning. So, we should read the question:<br/><br/>Is this [focus] a form of conditioning? <br/><br/>To which I say, yes, probably, but so is everything else we do. The question that interests me is "is this conditioning dysfunctional?" Are we stuck in patterns of thought that prevent us from achieving our goal (that goal I will describe as play or fun)? I'd answer probably not. I don't feel the sense of frustration that I think would accompany such failure. These games seem to be providing fun for lots of folks, so this conditioning passes the use-efficacy test for being at least minimally functional. <br/><br/>The next question, I guess, would be are these patterns maximally functional, meaning does this conditioning lead to the maximum amount of play in the most efficient and consistent manner? I'm not sure how to answer that question objectively. Subjectively, I think numbers and rules can be kinda cool (admittedly they can be uncool as well). Show me a Norwegian game without that focus and if it is way cool, but I don't like it, then I've been conditioned.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_76315">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76315/#Comment_76315" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-17T21:03:04+00:00" title="June 17, 2007  9:03PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 17, 2007 9:03PM by Levi Kornelsen.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Temple</cite>Because if you look at the original post, it is well worded, polite and asks a real question.

exactly this manner.  It's not to inform, but to shock and call attention.  If you call people using umbrellas "babykillers," you're doing it to make your point heard -- maybe not <i>understood</i>, but heard.  Of course, then you have to deal with being understood, and maybe even being heard at all in the future because of the people shouting at you drowning your future discourse out.<br/><br/>You're within your right to tell us we're splitting hairs, and we're within our rights to tell you that you're treating a cultural &amp; linguistic issue too lightly.  All that talk drowns out your point.  Sure, it got our attention Skjlag, but was it the right attention?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76330">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Temple" title="Temple"><img alt="Temple" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b340/kreutzer/ubt.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Temple">Temple</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76330/#Comment_76330" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-18T02:37:58+00:00" title="June 18, 2007  2:37AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, I see it from your POV now, and I can only agree.
