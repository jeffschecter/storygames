I'll be interested in what people think. It's just a rambling musing on ways to keep releasing content for a game.<br/><br/><hr/><br/><br/>You know what's great? Buying a game, being a fan of it, being able to go to your friendly local game store and get <em>more</em>\xa0for that game and incorporate it into your play, reinvigorating it and helping you keep enjoying this game you love. Or maybe you don't even have to buy it, if the designers release it for free\u2014less support for the <acronym title="Friendly Local Game Store">FLGS</acronym>, but easier on your wallet. Or maybe you don't have to <em>buy</em>\xa0it, but you do have to do <em>something</em>\xa0for it, some kind of weird activity.<br/><br/>At this point, we've moved beyond the "single simple perfect game" vs. "supplement treadmill" debate, I hope. The problem isn't supplements, it's poorly-thought-out supplements, it's supplements with too many moving pieces to interact with the core and the other supplements cleanly. It's supplements produced cynically to keep milking a property.[1] But neither is a single-book game perfect. If the book is a seed to the random number generator of our brains, we sometimes want or need other books (or content) to get more seeds to get more outputs.<br/><br/>So, we've started to see some games doing an interesting thing, making free well-considered content that fits in and adds to the replay value of the original game. The two big examples of this are, to my mind, <em>Fiasco</em>'s playsets and <em>Apocalypse World</em>'s playbooks.[2] There's an interesting difference between how they get produced: playsets are mostly fan-created, and Bully Pulpit collects the ones they think are best in a series of playsets-of-the-month; playbooks are mostly creator-produced, and distributed through things like donation to a kickstarter, or by running the game at a convention. Both models are cool, and both involve a kind of community involvement or club aspect.<br/><br/>But here's the real point: both are <em>just large enough</em>. There's enough content that you can't just tell it to someone. By way of contrast, consider Distinctions in <em>Smallville</em>\u2014or, for that matter, Moves in <em>Apocalypse World</em>. You can (and should!) make custom Distinctions or Moves readily and easily. But they're too small to distribute as a Thing. They're more like an after-dinner mint than a recipe.<br/><br/><hr/><br/><br/>[1] Let me say: I don\u2019t think that any but the second of these claims can be made substantively, but the other two are at least perceived to be the case sometimes.<br/><br/>[2] While the names are very similar, they\u2019re importantly different: playsets are collections of content for different settings, to be used one-at-a-time in each game. Playbooks are types of character, to be combined in the same game with the other playbooks and with the playbooks in the core Apocalypse World book.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_343767">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343767/#Comment_343767" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-23T14:28:07+00:00" title="September 23, 2011  2:28PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sooooooooooooooo yeah.<br/><br/>The "supplement treadmill" never existed. That doesn't mean there weren't bad supplements or supplements that missed the mark in some way.  But there just weren't purposeless/non-play-oriented supplements, that never happened.<br/><br/>(Unless we're talking about game fiction, fuck game fiction.)<br/><br/>I've thought about this quite a bit (while looking at my gigantic supplement collections, ahhh, consumah satisfackshun).<br/><br/>The best supplements I have really do fit your idea of "more and new inputs to get more new outputs from the same thing".  This is a good way of thinking about it, and perhaps a way of distinguishing the supplement from the "play aid", an equally (or more?) important but different type of support (sometimes jumbled into supplemental material too).<br/><br/>Here is one of my best supplements, it fits this definition perfectly:<br/><br/>The Forgotten Realms Campaign Sourcebook for D&amp;D3.  D&amp;D3 is interesting in part because its corebooks avoid actually doing much world-building/setting-building/situation-building as scrupulously as it can.  So a highly detailed, extremely evocative supplement ranging from the birds-eye view to the extremely concrete "here are this guy's stats" is an input you simply can't get from D&amp;D3. Yet at the same time it's aspirational/inspirational.  All the <i>tools</i> to make your own Forgotten Realms-detailed campaign are in D&amp;D3.<br/><br/>In fact, one supplement I can think of is reviled <i>because</i> people didn't approach it with your definition:<br/><br/>Dirty Secrets of the Black Hand.  This is an oWoD supplement that details a global, high-powered occult conspiracy of very nasty infiltrators and vampiric antiheros trying to deal with an evil alien/interdimensional menace.  Now, because I have always had your attitude towards supplements, I found this one to be pretty interesting - it was one of the first crossover-friendly campaign books I'd seen, it explained how to use a very heavy-handed tone in order to smooth over intra-party conflicts that had been baked into the rest of the setting, and it presented a format for a higher-power adventure-style campaign that I hadn't seen in WoD material before. However, because it "didn't fit" with the established world, it was (and still is) reviled and attacked as a bizarre/weird diversion from the normal game line. To me, that's the ideal thing for a supplement!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_343770">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343770/#Comment_343770" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-23T14:36:56+00:00" title="September 23, 2011  2:36PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>The "supplement treadmill" never existed.

Johnstone recently gifted me a copy of his print-only playbook quartet. It's extremely rad.<br/><br/>AW expects hacking as part of game play. Vincent realized that 'house-ruling' is something everyone does because you can design for groups you've never met or for campaigns you've never played in. So, why not incorporate it into the fundamentals of the game? Moving from custom moves to LE playbooks isn't that big of a step. And moving from that to Dungeon World is something that, apparently, is not only feasible but wildly popular as well.<br/><br/>I think part of the reason for this is encouraging fan-made content and hacking instead of litigating against it. Vincent's design process is pretty transparent and he actively encourages hacking and the like. I'm not sure size is really an issue. A play book is basically five custom moves arranged around a character concept with easy to make art and a little layout. Not something you can tweet but not really much larger. And they're are some small playbooklets kicking around that are basically just three or four custom advances. <br/><br/>However, I'm not sure that playbooks aren't to supplements as zines are to magazines. The first has a budget of zero-dollars and the second tens of thousands. <br/><br/>Sure, no one pays for a single mint, and no one expects to pay for home made cookies, but if you want a box of them, it'll cost you. More if you want them to actually be tasty.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_343814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343814/#Comment_343814" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-23T23:44:56+00:00" title="September 23, 2011 11:44PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I do think there's a possibility that there are more than one way for supplements to be used, so people might have different attitudes towards supplements.<br/><br/>I mean, another Monster Manual is like the first Monster Manual, but "just more, give me more".<br/><br/>That's cool!

The GM didn't really have more power than the players in terms of deciding what flew and what didn't; we were pretty egalitarian about that. The thought was, if your friend wants to do this thing, and this thing is from the rules somewhere, then sure, let your friend do the thing they want, and if it totally sucks then we can talk about that later." There was just way too much stuff in WoD for us to want to take the time to decide what goes and what doesn't.<br/><br/><b>"How did that work with, like, Themes and Tones and stuff?"<br/></b>We didn't like to proscribe themes and tones.

We didn't think about it that much. A setting fact wasn't incorporated until someone who had either a) read about that fact, or b) made it up went and incorporated it during play. Then it was true, unless we talked about it afterwards and decided to cut it.

Of course, my experience with games that have lots of supplements is mostly with Rifts and D&amp;D (and a tiny bit of Shadowrun). Rifts was the kind of game where a gonzo mix of weird characters spread across half a dozen sourcebooks was the norm, and D&amp;D tended to not make many supplements with classes that wouldn't fit into a generic D&amp;D campaign in the first place.<br/><br/>But to get back to the OP, I do like how we're seeing some games like Fiasco and Apocalypse World (and Technoir) that explicitly encourage people to make new material, and provide an easy avenue for doing so. Making a new playset for Fiasco is a hell of a lot easier than making a new class for D&amp;D4e, and does a lot more to change the overall game. I'd like to see more of that, and not just because it gives me an avenue for putting more weird anime shit in my gaming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_343910">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343910/#Comment_343910" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-25T01:41:46+00:00" title="September 25, 2011  1:41AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 25, 2011 1:45AM by JDCorley.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Lula</cite>The publishers' vision and intent for how the game should be played doesn't matter.

It makes it really hard for people to keep things straight, in my experience, when everyone only has a piece of the puzzle, none of the pieces fit together, and certainly it makes it REALLY hard for people to make good decisions if they don't have a "view of the board", so to speak.<br/><br/>My very, very best World of Darkness games were the ones where I had really limited what the game was going to be about up front, before anyone ever turned up.

I don't disbelieve you, but what's in my head when you say those things may be completely different from what you're talking about.<br/><br/>I think your point about focusing on things can be applied to RPGs pretty broadly, actually. Game design tends to be most successful when it has a small, reachable, specific target and goes for it hard.<br/><br/>Gonzo and fun probably describes us, yeah. We had some pretty wacky character and theme combinations.<br/><br/>As for what was in those supplements and the original game that made us want to play that way: it was more of a "huh, these things can interact mechanically, let's see what happens when we make them do it."<br/><br/>It's like playing with Legos. You take the parts for the space station out of the box and you make a space station like it says, and then you have a very pretty functional space station. You take the parts for the castle out of the box and you make a castle like it says, and then you have a very pretty functional castle. But when you can stick the castle parts on the space station and vice versa, eventually you're going to try building a hideous amalgam of the two; and none of it will do what it said it would on the tin, but by then you're kind of attached to your dragon with a flamethrower and your space pirate with a peg leg and a martini.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344563">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344563/#Comment_344563" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-30T16:12:09+00:00" title="September 30, 2011  4:12PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Lula</cite>I confess I am confused about what there is to be confused about.

If you added up all the clans from all the other books, there were probably 40 or so.  7 is easier to keep straight. (3 is even easier - 1 is easier than that.)

Why do I need to know about the next guy's clan, though? I don't think characters' knowledge about each others' clans ever really came into the game. No one brought it up. No one even brought it up with the NPCs, except to react to the things they actually said and did which acted out political allegiance. There are lots of times I've played RPGs in which people made character background choices which I didn't understand, and they were fine. For example, my friend once played a character from Tibet, and I've never been to Tibet and I know very little about the country, and her character was pretty deeply tied to the country she came from and the politics there and stuff. It was fine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DLinkus" title="DLinkus"><img alt="DLinkus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DLinkus">DLinkus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344675/#Comment_344675" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-01T23:18:16+00:00" title="October  1, 2011 11:18PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><br/>Well, take the clans.  In the normal ole Vampire book there are 7 clans.  If you added up all the clans from all the other books, there were probably 40 or so.  7 is easier to keep straight. (3 is even easier - 1 is easier than that.)  Particularly if not everyone has read every single page of every single book and knows every single thing about it.</blockquote>\nThis seems to be running with the assumption that characters know everything the player does. Personally, I always liked the limits that the dots on the sheet in the knowledges section placed on how much you can drag in your metagame information. We loved to talk about the weird stuff we had read in supplements before and after game, but when the GM introduced an element that we had all read about in some brand new supplement, we assumed our characters didn't know what we did, because that made it interesting. I don't think limiting our choices to 7 clans would be the answer, limiting our character's knowledge to default clans (and of course, their own) more than did the trick. You don't have to make things not exist in the game world to prevent people's characters from knowing about them.\n<blockquote>Like, where does the "all books are valid" approach leave the casual player who owns a Xeroxed character sheet, some d10s, and that's all?

Usually, we would encourage new players to start out as a character brand new to being a Vampire (when playing VtM, same idea for other games). This way, knowledge could be introduced to the player and character at the same time. In the rare case that they were insistent on playing a wise, old, well learned about their situation character, we'd all pitch in and make sure the player was aware of things their character should be when they came up. <br/><br/>I've had some very excellent experiences with limited oWoD games (one of my favourites was an all Tremere game that a friend ran), but a mish-mosh of clans makes for some excellent fun as well (even if the PCs don't care about clan rules and loyalties, NPCs do and the inherent issues of befriending the "enemy" can make for stories easily). For our games, it was the GM's job to help make the pieces fit, and with their help the puzzles tend to look nice in the end (even if the pieces were from all over the place). We wanted to play characters that acted like real people, not make decisions based on a pre-chosen feel that the game was supposed to have. In my experience, you don't need a view of the board if you're just playing a character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344676">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344676/#Comment_344676" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-01T23:41:44+00:00" title="October  1, 2011 11:41PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DLinkus</cite>This seems to be running with the assumption that characters know everything the player does.</blockquote>\nNope, not at all.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DLinkus</cite>We wanted to play characters that acted like real people, not make decisions based on a pre-chosen feel that the game was supposed to have.
