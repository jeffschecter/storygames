So many people yearn for them - many people I know have gotten tired of one-shots and just want to sit down for some week-in week-out campaign play. I think its got to do with something that doesn't happen in the shorter games - character experience and familiarity. Most shorter games rely on stereotyping to give their characters background and depth, starting them off as fully fledged people with presumed backgrounds that people can draw on. Campaign games start you off with quite 2D characters, with the intention that they grow through play, and that you experience their growth directly throughout a story that can potentially become very epic (another things short games don't often feel like they're achieving). <br/><br/>On the back of that, can anyone tell me what story games out there are appropriate or designed for long term or campaign play (defined in my head as being for 5 or more sessions, or at least for more than one mini-plot arc)? I've heard that the Burning Wheel is like that, PTA can do it and well, and I think that Hot War could turn out as that sort of game (though the agenda mechanic makes me wonder and the pre-game scene is a nice mechanic to simulate longer term character familiarity).<br/><br/>In those games that are suitable for long play, can you tell me how they address the concept of campaign play within the game text - is it something they can do purely coincidentally, is it part of the mechanic, does the author go into depth about how this game can be appropriate for campaign play, or what?<br/><br/>Basically, I've decided that this whole super-cool story games thing will only benefit me if I use it to address issues which matter to me in roleplaying games, and the one major frustration I always have is with campaigns that plod along with no pacing or build to a climax, that don't end properly, and that leave my characters in limbo once its done. On the other hand, I love the campaign. Any thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133547">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133547/#Comment_133547" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-09T04:56:46+00:00" title="March  9, 2008  4:56AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            With the Owe list establishing who's a recurring character, In A Wicked Age is specifically designed for long term play, albeit with a rotating GM and a roster of characters rather than a consistent party throughout.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133548">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/oliof" title="oliof"><img alt="oliof" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.mausdompteur.de/gravn32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/oliof">oliof</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133548/#Comment_133548" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-09T05:26:52+00:00" title="March  9, 2008  5:26AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 9, 2008 5:28AM by oliof.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love one-shots, but they have a few draw backs: You seldom get comfortable with the game and your characters to be at ease playing, since you're always in the adoption/assimilation phase; on the long run this can be unfulfilling. Also, you often lack phases of denouement, as every new game needs do go steve-jobs-BOOM-style and there's no place for quiet reflection, stunting the repertoire of pacing instruments. Finally, there's little space for long term goals and motivations to be pursued and/or developed, stunting the choice of expression of theme.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy hypothesis for the abundance of one-shot-style play with indie games is the following: The high-impact 15 minute demos and the reports about them. In addition, a lot of people get to know indie games at conventions, which is inherently one-shot-gaming; my suspicion is that they bring these experience back to their gaming tables and try to get "there" within the single-session-scope, forgetting there's other ways to play with a group at home.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has been said before that a lot of indie games need about three sessions to "blossom", and I think this is not articulated enough. Also, the physical properties of indie books might convey the idea that they are for "short games" \u2013 i.e., one-shots or double-session play. Hopefully noone thinks I ask people to write longer texts just to alleviate this problem\u2026<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, here are some indie/story games I know to be viable for campaign play (5 or more sessions): Dogs in the Vineyard (serial play,  gets to finale play after 7 to 12 sessions according to various reports), Burning Empires (four-arc super structure that only gets out of the way in campaign play), The Shadow of Yesterday (as much campaign play as you want, transcendence is a tool to avoid aimless characters), Artesia (including the option of full-blown wars as campaign elements), Reign (even moreso), Sorcerer (kickers to be resolved in one session probably are 'weak').<br/>\n<br/>\nOnly one game (burning empires) gives you a campaign-like super structure, the others give you other tools to be informed about the campaign's content (Dogs: Traits, Fallout; Sorcerer: Kickers; The Shadow of Yesterday: Keys; Artesia: Life path and Arcana; Reign: Passions and whatsitcalled; Burning Empires: Planet burner) and status (The Shadow of Yesterday: distance-to-transcendence; Reign: Company Rules; Sorcerer: R-Map and distance-to-resolution; Dogs: Reflection). If you have any of these games, it might be worthwhile to re-read them with an eye turned towards campaign based play instead of "how do I make this all click <i>right off the bat</i>"  \u2013 I know it helped me.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso: Reading campaign information for mainstream/trad/whatever games might help you see what you want and don't want of what's in there. I have the full set of PDFs with the 'Age of Worms' adventure path on my disk for analytical purposes; but I'd still like to run this beast (with something other than d20, and probably not on tracks laid out as hard as written); and I bought several Savage Worlds 'plot point campaigns', namely Pirates of the Spanish Main and The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane  \u2013 these are somewhere between scripted campaigns and emerging-from-play campaigns; I still have some issues with them, but this is not the place to discuss them.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinal Note: The list of sample games is what I'm comfortable making judgements about, not what I think are the only games supporting campaign-based play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133558">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133558/#Comment_133558" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-09T07:15:42+00:00" title="March  9, 2008  7:15AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm used to playing campaigns which last at least a year or two at one session a week, or more (some have been four or five years), and that is very much the norm for almost everyone I know who games (and there are lots of people who game around here). Short form games of the type usually talked about here are uncommon.<br><br>The biggest thing that we get out of them are detailed and involved world design and investigation, and very in-depth characters that we really identify with. I can *get* a character in a one off and enjoy playing him, but not to the extent of knowing all about each of his family members, and writing pages of back-story, and commissioning character artwork from people on the internet, and all that sort of thing. I love knowing that much about my characters, and really exploring them and becoming them, and I like to do the same with the game world, drawing pictures of it, making maps, exploring it's cultures and customs and foods (sometimes we go so far as to have meals with the gaming group that suit the food of wherever the game is set) and so on.<br><br>I don't think we are unique in this, it's what people mean, I think, when they yearn for a campaign, that involvement with a particular piece of fiction on a scale far larger than the equivalent of a TV episode. It's like watching an episode of SG1 is fun, but watching the whole 7 series and delving into the fandom is more fun. My wife, for example, is only slightly interested in one-offs (and in her mind by most story games) because they don't offer that depth of character immersion.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133570">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133570/#Comment_133570" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-09T10:42:22+00:00" title="March  9, 2008 10:42AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a forerunner to my thoughts, I use long-form and short-form to describe the same things you're talking about. <br><br>I'm pretty much universal in my longing for long-form gaming. I can and do enjoy short-form games, but my preference is for the same style of character and setting growth you're getting at. <br><br>It may or may not be important to note that my gaming career is characterized by a lot of beginnings to long-form games that rarely go more than a couple months at a stretch, and do not include any games lasting even close to a year of constant play. <br><br>Out of the indie-style games I've played or heard of, I think Burning Wheel definitely fits this criteria, and encourages it with it's life-path system.. It creates characters who appear to be in the midst of their lives, rather than at the beginning. Character growth is slow enough that you won't likely become mighty in any short span of time, although you can be pretty powerful if you don't mind starting out as an older character. <br><br>A favorite of mine is The Riddle of Steel, which I've played fairly extensively. As this has a fairly traditional resolution system, it can fall into the same traps that traditional campaign-style games do, unless both the GM *and the players* are focused on the Spiritual Attributes. It's a gritty, deadly game that allows for and somewhat encourages over-the-top scenes charged with thematic content. <br/><br/>Blood Red Sands is a game in alpha testing that I'm somewhat familiar (though I've not yet managed to set up a playtest of it) that may also fit the bill. It is currently designed to play out in 10 "Ordeals" each of which is intended to last for 1-2 four hour sessions, so you're probably looking at an average of 15 sessions to go from start to finish. <br/><br/>My own design efforts have gone in this direction as well with my oldest in-design game Mage Blade. Mage Blade is designed to play out long-form, with a beginning a middle and an end. It isn't likely to be one of those years-spanning games (though it has the potential, if the players wish to drive it in that direction) but it's hardly worth playing as a one-shot, given the Goal-based metasystem.<br/><br/>Dogs in the Vineyard is another that I think needs longer-term play to really get at the meat of the themes it's meant to explore. You can get some serious thematic bang in a one-shot, but the longer play allows for the "And now? How about *now*?"questions. A few towns to allow the players/characters to set their judgement precedents. Then a few more towns to challenge the judgements they made before. Then a few more towns to push even harder on the judgements they kept from the first set of towns to the second, with a few "here is the fallout of the decisions you made in town X" thrown in for good measure.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133572">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133572/#Comment_133572" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-09T11:07:38+00:00" title="March  9, 2008 11:07AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You can shine the spotlight on more things:<br/><br/>More character facets<br/>More setting facets (settings?!

In our group, one-shots are unusual -- we've done them, but typically only in the context of "Hey, I just got this new game and I want to test it out this weekend" or "Since only half of us are going to be here next week, we'll just do a one-shot."  Most of the time we do a game that lasts 3-6 months, meeting approximately weekly.  That's enough to get through a couple of good story arcs and reach a satisfying conclusion, without going on so long that the GM (or anyone else) gets burned out on it.<br/><br/>It also addresses at least one part of Shevaun's original question, in that nowadays most of our campaigns are actually built with the notion that we'll be playing for 12-24 sessions and then moving on to something new.  Establishing a firm expectation that the campaign will reach a good ending within X number of sessions did wonders for us: it really suits our group's preferences and gives us all something to aim for, which in turn helps the pacing of the game <i>feel</i> better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Storn" title="Storn"><img alt="Storn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Storn">Storn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133679/#Comment_133679" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-10T07:25:40+00:00" title="March 10, 2008  7:25AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is something about the pacing of a longer term games that can really be gold.<br/><br/>My most successful long term campaigns that I've been part of (GMing or playing) often has that magical session where nothing goes boom!  It is slow, contemplative session, but serious role playing occurs, character development is forefront.  This does not happen in one shots.  Or even 3 session arcs.<br/><br/>Then there is the evolution aspect.  Seeing characters and the situation change over time.  The subtle changes are usually the most interesting in hindsight.  <br/><br/>Then there is the density of detail aspect.  When you've run a 9 year setting, with multiple campaigns set in it, it really becomes this rich stew.  It is an oil painting.  Not a pencil sketch anymore.  <br/><br/>We've been trying to get a longterm campaign going... but damn, the logistics of it has been murder on our game group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133682">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133682/#Comment_133682" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-10T07:51:11+00:00" title="March 10, 2008  7:51AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Longer-form games allow different qualities to bubble to the surface. It's somewhat akin to the difference between a short story or a novel. Or a movie as compared with a serial television show (The French Connection vs. The Wire, as it were).<br/><br/>Short-form games tend to explode  (with action or melodrama or whatever). They paint in broad strokes. They tend to be straight forward and simpler. I don't mean that in a pejorative way. I just mean that the characters tend to have one or two motivations and when those motivations are resolved (and they can't take too much to resolve because you've only got one to three sessions) the story is finished and the characters get put away.<br/><br/>Longer-form games are on a slower simmer. They have the room to become more intricate. They can spend more time focusing on color. You don't have to shy from subtlety: You can spend sessions layering on new dimensions to a conflict until it slowly reaches that explosive moment that short-form games tend to generate in the space of a single session. In my experience, those moments tend to be more satisfying because of the greater level of ownership of the situation. We didn't just agree to start in the situation, we slowly built our way up to it.<br/><br/>Neither short-form nor long-form games are superior to the other, they just have different qualities and serve different needs.<br/><br/>Games that benefit from longer-term play include:<br/>Burning Wheel<br/>Burning Empires<br/>Sorcerer<br/>Trollbabe<br/>Dogs in the Vineyard<br/>In a Wicked Age<br/>With Great Power...<br/>Nine Worlds<br/>Conspiracy of Shadows<br/>Polaris<br/>HeroQuest<br/>The Shadow of Yesterday<br/>Primetime Adventures<br/><br/>I know there are others I'm missing from my list, but I've got to get to a meeting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133685">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133685/#Comment_133685" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-10T08:17:16+00:00" title="March 10, 2008  8:17AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why watch the same soap opera for ten years?

I think we need to distinguish between long-form and open ended though. They are not necessarily synonymous, although they often are.<br/><br/>At BWHQ we have a long-form Burning Wheel game, currently on hiatus, which is not open ended. There are definite end conditions in place and once we attain them, the game will be over. Burning Empires is the same way. You might play a full campaign in 18 to 26 sessions, but then you're done.<br/><br/>Other games I'm in do tend to be open ended. Our In a Wicked Age game is. I'm in a couple BW games that have campaign arcs. Once we finish an arc, we'll set out new goals and keep going. I've also got a tSoY game that we come back to now and again that has a more freewheeling, open ended quality.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133732">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133732/#Comment_133732" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-10T10:37:43+00:00" title="March 10, 2008 10:37AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 10, 2008 10:43AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What's interesting, Thor, is that before we became enlightened about this (we meaning at least the people I used to play with), there was no distinction between these two. That is, the game was technically "open-ended" in that there was no planning for how long it would go. But there always was a sense that, perhaps, if you played long enough, you'd get to the end. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou never did, of course. The game always died out... or you're still playing it at glacial pace 20 years later, like I am in one case. Or the game crashed to a close due to somebody moving or something. But that doesn't change the fact that GM's especially had a notion in their heads that they would mount things up to a climax after ten years of play and the characters were all 20th level, and figure out a fitting ending to it all. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, basically, there's a third sort. "Open-Ended" means "Indeterminate." Or "We don't know when it'll stop, but we expect that it will come to a close if it doesn't collapse under it's own weight at some point." As opposed to "Permanent," meaning an expectation that the game will not end until the players decide to quit playing for some reason like moving. <br/>\n<br/>\nLike the General Hospital of gaming, no end even contemplated. This is rare, but explicit in some groups. That's because this instance of the game becomes the hobby in question. "Pete's Game" is the hobby. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I'd categorize like so:<br/>\nShort Form - what's the break-off here... 10 games? ;-)<br/>\nLong Form - Longer than short form<br/>\nOpen-Ended - Length undetermined<br/>\nPermanent - indended not to end<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133754/#Comment_133754" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-10T11:54:03+00:00" title="March 10, 2008 11:54AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like long term play but not open-ended play.

Long term Primetime Adventures is awesome but it's composed of a series of finite Episodes.  Long term Sorcerer is awesome but it's composed of series of finite Kickers.  They are "open ended" in that you can always tack on another Town, Season, or Kickers but each of those come to an end and you can evaluate whether you want to go on or stop without just giving up.<br/><br/>I've run both 7th Sea and Riddle of Steel in a semi-open ended manner and both games kind of just had to stop because there was no finite sub-unit of play.

I was going to come in here with my own terminology, but Mike beat me with his. <br/><br/>Short-Form and Long-Form I use pretty much the same as Mike describes it. <br/><br/>The other terms I use are Close-Form and Open-Form. <br/><br/>Close-Form is like MLwM, or TMW... games with a definite, usually mechanically determined ending. This can be rigidly structured like "We'll play X sessions, then it's over" like Blood Red Sands, It's Complicated, and a few others I've seen. It can also be "When certain conditions are met, it's over" like (I think?) MLwM, and my own previously mentioned project, Mage Blade. <br/><br/>Open-Form is games that have no defined ending to the campaign or arc. Most traditional games are like this. Dogs in the Vineyard is like this as well, unless I missed something that said that you're supposed to play for a certain number of towns. They may end, but it's not pre-defined in any way.<br/><br/>Permanent is a new concept to me, to be honest. I thought that those 20 year games were just the games that were Open-Form, and hadn't reached a point where they've stopped for whatever reason. <br/><br/>Now, I want long-closed-form games. I want the game to go for a while, to have room to explore characters' personalities, secrets, and situations. I want them to have time to grow, to accomplish things through effort. I want the story to grow and rise toward the eventual climax. And then I want it to end, hopefully with the heroes conquering, but dying gloriously in the attempt is pretty good too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133923">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133923/#Comment_133923" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-11T05:08:48+00:00" title="March 11, 2008  5:08AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My last five campaigns have been as follows<br/><br/>(1) Long-form open / permanent.

It's probably hardly ever the case that somebody puts together a group and says, "we're going to play this game as long as bloody possible." What happens is that the game starts, and, then, at some point some the following dialog occurs:<br/>\n<br/>\nGM: "I've been thinking that these characters are getting pretty high-level... what do you think about me bringing the campaign to an end. <br/>\nPlayer: "No way, man... this game is just so much fun... I don't ever want it to end."<br/>\nGM: "Huh... glad you feel that way man... I guess we'll just keep it going then, indefintely." <br/>\nPlayer: "Great!"<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat's really interesting about these things is that often the expectations about length are not really set. The players think that, eventually there's going to be some climax, but the GM hasn't even contemplated an end to things, and is actively trying to figure out what to have the players do once they've slain all of the gods. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134183">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134183/#Comment_134183" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-11T16:42:18+00:00" title="March 11, 2008  4:42PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Note that permanent, as opposed to Open-Ended-Because-We-Haven't-Talked-About-It is pretty rare.</blockquote>\nIn my experience, this is very true and totally crucial to why I personally as a GM keep burning out and running into doors and yelling "ow my nose, stupid door, why aren't you open!"

These, while being long enough to move forward an interesting plot and get acquainted with characters, don't seem quite long enough to me. No long-term goals are explored, no character growth occurs. This is not what I want as a GM, because it's more fun to write with the characters in mind, in a personality sense rather than an ability sense. As a player, it feels like the character's just getting interesting. Campaign length isn't the only factor that affects this, but it is the most relevant. Longer games allow you to really get in character, because you've had the time to figure out who that character is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
