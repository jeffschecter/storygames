Are there enough people interested in doing so and having such a community? <br/><br/>I wasn't part of the Forge community but I feel as though it was a place that was serious about rpgs about design and about theory. You can't say that the Forge didn't improve RPGs; the form was largely stagnant and the Forge caused a swell of innovation\u2014yes, not all of it good, but lots of it was and is, and there is still a ton of work to do. What am I missing? Why aren't we still doing this? What happened? <br/><br/>If I hosted a website strictly for this purpose (i.e. design, theory, innovation, etc.) would people come?  A place to come with goodwill and offer each other solutions and to put our egos aside and try to make really, really good games, and to solve the problems of certain forms and create new ones. To think critically about games and theory. Is this something people still want?

Some things you can do on a "build it and they will come" basis, while other things are like capturing lightning in a bottle.<br/><br/>Specifically, what made the Forge work for us was that a large number of roleplayers in the X generation (those who'd started in the hobby in the late '80s or through the '90s) shared common ground in being dissatisfied with the traditional rpg culture that was still the standard in the early '00s. In hindsight there were specific issues in the rpg culture that we were interested in addressing, and we did. These concerns were a multitude, and they all interconnected in a way that made the Forge very important for an ambitious young designer; it wasn't just game design, and not just rpg theory, but also publishing practice and marketing.<br/><br/>Notably the people who did the Forge thing haven't disappeared anywhere, it's just that our interests have diverged sufficiently for us to have less to talk about together: some have fixed their roleplaying and are thus happy playing (as opposed to doing self-therapy on web forums); some have become productive designers keen to work on their own stuff; some run contests or workshops or local scene support. Some even do rpg theory on occasion. What we do not have, however, is a pressing collective need to lay out the rpg conundrum in the open and solve it together, day by day. I can't speak for everybody from the Forge, but I think many people simply don't need that sort of thing anymore because we already have all the answers, and have thus transcended the need for the Forge [grin].<br/><br/>For a "new Forge" to be a meaningful endeavour, there would need to exist a similar generational experience, a need for collective action. Roleplaying's a small subculture, so we're not talking huge numbers, but that scale's still not something you're going to achieve without an actual demographic need for it. If one were to hypothetically start up a new Forge-kind website, I would expect it to lack in membership interest, unless one happened to tap a new demographic need with it.<br/><br/>I cannot say whether and when the time might be ripe for something like that, I'll note. The OSR trend was the most recent equivalent of the Forge, and I don't know what the next "big thing" will be. One could imagine it to be something that requires new rpg theory, new game design, new methods of publishing, in which case something pretty similar to the Forge could be the thing to do. A forum is, after all, a great place to host in-depth correspondence and invite new people to participate as you go along. But you absolutely got to have something to talk about first, and that's far from given.<br/><br/>One might also consider whether it'd be possible to do something similar to the Forge, except less intense, because the people are in different places in their lives and so on. Various things have been tried in this regard, one might say that Story Games has developed into one of those attempts - more of a cultural saloon than a workshop. You can see how SG compensates for the lack of that intensity and zeal by having a much wider and more casual range of topics, for instance. Other attempts at doing Forge-like things at lower intensity abound: we do mailing lists, blogs, con gaming, lectures, IRC channels, design workshops and such instead of a 24/7 forum, because that's perhaps a more appropriate medium for where we're at.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466294">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466294/#Comment_466294" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-17T05:57:38+00:00" title="September 17, 2017  5:57AM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A practical note on setting up the forum, by the way: hold off on doing that until you actually have a mass of on-going conversation sufficient for justifying a new forum. This is very concrete: you need to know many people who want to talk with you about this stuff all the time, such that you cause some place like Story Games (or wherever you meet these people) to congest with the traffic. That's when a new forum is necessary. Starting the forum first is pretty backwards, I personally think.<br/><br/>This is incidentally how Ron Edwards set up the Forge forums, by the way: he originally started the Forge as an article hosting site related to rpg theory discussions he had elsewhere, and then started up the forum to have a more friendly place to discuss the related issues. When he started the forums, he did that in the context of an already-existing community of discourse, even if its size at the time paled with the later popularity of the Forge.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466297">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466297/#Comment_466297" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-17T11:43:29+00:00" title="September 17, 2017 11:43AM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Forge existed to serve two propositions.<br/><br/>One was, <i>you can create a roleplaying game that works exactly how you want it to work.</i> The reason for all of the theory was to tear down conventional wisdom about how rpgs must work so that we could see how they might work.<br/><br/>The other was, <i>you can publish your game yourself.</i> When the Forge began, PDF was new, PayPal was new, and print on demand was very rare. Lulu was new, OneBookShelf didn't exist, Kickstarter REALLY didn't exist yet.<br/><br/>When the Forge closed, it was because <i>you can create a game that works how you want, and you can publish it yourself</i> was a done deal. It was how the world worked in 2012. We didn't need to keep reaching toward it.<br/><br/>My advice is, if you want a "new Forge," have a project. Have something you're trying to accomplish, not just something you want to talk about, have a plan, and make it ambitious.<br/><br/>-Vincent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466300">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466300/#Comment_466300" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-17T15:23:02+00:00" title="September 17, 2017  3:23PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jeff, I think there are plenty of groups out there working to innovate in RPG design, and none of them have taken off Forge-style.  <a href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">@DanMaruschak</a> created Re-Forged and it didn't see a ton of work.  <a href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">@James_Mullen</a> seems to have had more success with Games on Trial, and you should probably check that out, but that's not huge either.<br/><br/>As for theorizing, I think individuals are still having new ideas about how RPGs can work, and talking about those ideas, but I don't see any desire to assemble all those words into one place.

(When I say "problems," I'm saying they have a lot of room to grow, and from <i>my perspective</i> they have a lot of problems).Their problems and the difficulties of solving their problems and innovating in the space isn't going to be something of mainstream interest, but I think I would like to work on the project and see where it gets me. I'm interested in making games work that shouldn't work in the GMless Story Game space and finding novel solutions. I have a lot of frustration and dissatisfaction with the GMless Story Games I play, but I also see great promise in them; there is a certain magic that can happen in collaborative storytelling and when it happens it's hard to beat.<br/><br/>I'm also interested in the space between Story Games, as Ben Robbins defines them <a href="http://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/460/defining-story-games/" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and more mainstream RPGs\u2014think of something on the spectrum between a pure Story Game, as defined above, and a PbtA game. I'm interested in how to get the best out of both of these forms\u2014to the extent possible\u2014without ruining what is great about each of them. <br/><br/>I think as Vincent suggested, I will do my own thing, and try to tackle and solve difficult problems with whatever gusto and time I can manage...the work will speak for itself, for better or worse. Anyway, I bought the domain GMless.com\u2014check it out in seven years, haha <img alt=":smiley:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title=":smiley:"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466307/#Comment_466307" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-18T00:19:57+00:00" title="September 18, 2017 12:19AM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 18, 2017 12:46AM by David_Berg.">edited September 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Mongrel_GM" rel="nofollow">Mongrel_GM</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Excellent points.

There was some wrangling, there were some agreements, there was some wisdom that's been succinctly recorded, and there were some ideas that remain communication hurdles to this day.

If you go to a store with a <i>big</i> RPG selection, though, you'll see a lot more self-published games that bear little resemblance to D&amp;D than you would have in the 1990s.

Later traditional designs are a bit like fixed wing aircraft, story games like helicopters. The origin of helicopters is a big deal in aerospace history. But it wouldn't be accurate to say that fixed wing aircraft design was stagnating until the invention of the helicopter. <br/><br/>*****<br/><br/>I'll have to say that one theory that I'd like to explore more, and discuss, is MDA theory. For me it has been absolutely eye-opening: from a player, GM, and designer perspective. It takes the idea of providing or facilitating play experience tailored to the individual and makes it the central consideration. From simple to complex designs, from loose to rigid rules sets, it seems to be the most useful tool I've ever used. And it has the added benefit, when used well, of side-stepping all of the ego bruising that is so easy to fall into. I even think it helps players, GMs, and designers think about how people with different play goals might possibly have a beneficial in-game experience together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander" title="Rob_Alexander"><img alt="Rob_Alexander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/638/nM7WEDAVEW1RY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander">Rob_Alexander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466310/#Comment_466310" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-18T09:06:04+00:00" title="September 18, 2017  9:06AM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 18, 2017 9:15AM by Rob_Alexander.">edited September 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Echo <a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">@Eero_Tuovinen</a> and on all points.

The part that I focus on more is how the game mediates the social interactions at the table.  Like, do your procedures make the players talk to each other, or just to the GM?  Is the group structure purely cooperative, or partly competitive?  What does the game do, via inspirational material, character sheet design, reward system, etc. to communicate the point of play and get everyone on the same page about what that is?  Do we want a GM who acts as boss, or referee, or facilitator, or do we not want any one person in any of those roles?

And I can confirm there are many things that are given fro granted today. Before reading anything at the forge my approach to making/hacking games was mostly about finding practical ways to do things that I felt the games I played were doing wrong. There I found so many people making the same mistakes that I did that they had coined a term for it: Fantasy Heartbreaker. It was nice to learn about other games, ideas and different points of view about roleplaying games.<br/><br/>But at the end discussing about loose mechanics and game fragments became impossible, Ron himself closed ant thread that wasn't about a full completed game as he considered these loose discussions spam. That was the thing that killed the forge to me and I ended up finding and moving to SG before the forge finally closed.<br/><br/>Things here were more hectic, casual and chaotic, but even with that it felt less confrontational than they were at the forge on the last months. It was fun and even when at times there were more players than designers, not too many people frowned at you when you started a thread on crazy mechanics that could or not end up turning into a game.<br/><br/>As time went on SG had its troubles and personal drama too, some rules had to be enforced and we found out that it was for good. Here I ended up learning even more than on the Forge, that games were more about how the people playing them understands them, that how good they turn out depends more on the dynamic of the players than of the actual mechanics used, but that these are the ones that transmit the players what's the game about and if they aren't clear to start with, players will either need tons of additional advice, end making up a different game from your text or completely ruining the experience.<br/><br/>So, if this new Forge were to be about theory... I'd probably read some of the stuff every once in a while. If it were about design I'll definitely like to participate. But the thing that got me more interested in the last few months was the idea developed in these two threads:<br/>-<a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21203/subscene-that-assumes-gms-will-hack-but-that-strongly-values-design/p1" rel="nofollow">Subscene that assumes GMs will hack but that strongly values design</a><br/>-<a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21229/open-design-guides-for-collaborative-design-using-markdown-git-etc" rel="nofollow">[Open Design] Guides for collaborative design using Markdown, git, etc.</a><br/><br/>The basic idea is this: at Github programmers share bits of code for others to use as they want, so nobody has to figure out and write a whole program/application by themselves. People there also collaborate on other people's projects with pieces of programs and other stuff, so projects get completed faster.<br/><br/>Now imagine that applied to RPGs: you could design a conflict resolution mechanic and ask people to help you develop the rest of the game, establishing some standards like genre, etc. But there's more: those people could take those parts and make a different game. Mechanics could also be edited by others to suit their needs. It's more or less the part that I liked most from the Forge and SG, except that everything is CC, free to use and modify.<br/><br/>Sadly it died way too fast, I managed to post something at the Github reservoir but had no feedback and haven't seen anybody else post anything. The Github platform is definitely way too complicated for some people and there's no similar but simple enough solution able to help people share info in an organized way, keeping different versions of the same files nor different collections of the those files.<br/><br/>Who knows, perhaps this will happen when the proper technology is available or gets easier to use.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466319">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466319/#Comment_466319" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-18T17:14:13+00:00" title="September 18, 2017  5:14PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 18, 2017 5:15PM by Bill_White.">edited September 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Back in the early days of the Forge, in one of their weekly conversations about running the place, Clinton Dreisbach (n\xe9 Nixon) said something like, "About 5% of people will never get this": that the Forge is about creator ownership, about self-publishing for tabletop role-playing games. And while the theory stuff "became bigger and bigger," in Clinton's words, by the end of the Forge, Ron was pretty adamant that it should be a place where anyone, regardless of their design approach, could come and talk about what they were trying to do and get advice and support from the Forge community. <br/></p><p>With respect to "Forge theory" (and Ron insists he never used that term), it seems to me that the Big Model in particular was less a theory of design than a heuristic for unpacking unsatisfactory play--necessary for designing the game you want, as Vincent puts it. That's why you can find a whole bunch of threads where people are interested in trying to use the Big Model to unpack why they're unhappy with their current game. The Big Model invites paying attention to the social context in which the game is taking place (i.e., the real people and the relationships among them) as well as the clashes or disconnects in terms of aesthetic preferences and expectations among the players. <br/></p><p>That's not to say that there weren't RPG design-related concepts, like the "lumpley-Boss principle" that defines <em>system</em> as the means for determining who gets to say what is true about what in the fiction when, the "Czege principle" that it is unsatisfying to have to both establish (fictional) adversity and determine the means through which it is overcome, and ideas like handling time, reward cycles, and IIEE (i.e., intent, initiation, execution, and effect as elements of resolving a task). But by and large there was an attempt to focus discussion on "actual play" in a way that now strikes me as a kind of "ethno-phenomenology," i.e., a community's attempt to understand or make sense of its own mental experience via systematic reflection--to address, in other words, the question of what it is like to role-play.</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466320/#Comment_466320" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-18T17:35:14+00:00" title="September 18, 2017  5:35PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" rel="nofollow">WarriorMonk</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Sadly it died way too fast, I managed to post something at the Github reservoir but had no feedback and haven't seen anybody else post anything.

If it's the key somebody needs to progress their art, then I'm all for it, but personally I don't get it.

I mean, the fact is that we still do all the same things we did at the Forge. Game designers have been doing these things for decades <i>before</i> the Forge. However, only very rarely do we gather into greater communities, it seems.<br/><br/>Speaking for myself, I spend a considerable amount of time every year doing very Forge-like things: I craft rpg theory and debate it, I design and playtest my own games, I review and playtest <i>other</i> people's games... I just don't do these things at the Forge anymore for obvious reasons, and there isn't any pressing need to publicize this stuff all the time, so I haven't exactly yearned for a replacement platform, either. It's interesting how low on the list of priorities an open online community seems to be for me when it comes to the art of gaming; I can see how I need the communal contacts <i>to some degree</i>, but apparently that degree isn't nearly so much as to make a forum community mandatory. I seem to make do just fine with more private and traditional social networks.<br/><br/>Part of this is very probably age: 15 years ago, if I had been doing the sort of stuff I've been doing e.g. this summer, I would likely have been very keen to publish and publicize the work. Age has brought a modicum of disinterest to me, and a sense of perspective; not only do I care less about other people's opinions, but I also understand better how mediocre my work is, and therefore I have less need to seek peer approval for it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466325">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466325/#Comment_466325" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-18T19:35:28+00:00" title="September 18, 2017  7:35PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>Out of topic, but in case nobody's said this yet about the project, I'll share my personal thinking on why the Github thing isn't a complete community solution...<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nI'd barely call it a sharing solution, there's not much of a practical way there to foster community-like exchange of anything that isn't mechanics.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>...by itself: it's not the platform so much as the fact that compiling and recombining discrete game mechanics isn't my idea of high-quality design.

However I get that you need to see the art in it. I took the github proposal as a box of free tools that could spark game ideas for people more oriented to think in terms of programming and engineering. I expected most of the stuff there to be content-free bits of things that could be used anywhere, not high quality design complete proposals. I'll give it to you that this isn't everybody's cup of tea. I'm not even a programmer nor an engineer, though I get them a bit as I work with a group of the former and my dad is one of the latter. Even with that I'm not sure this kind of content was what everyone else had in mind when the project was proposed. Anyway...\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>Coming back to the subject matter, it's an interesting question why communality in game development isn't more of a no-brainer.

Like, meeting a few people at the Forge who lived in your same city or attended the same conventions and play the same games, so now you've got a group you can talk to about design. Then you would think -why should I expose my sanity arguing on a forum about my personal projects? What's there to gain? If this were my case, I wouldn't vouch for another Forge neither. And I wouldn't even call this 'age', well, perhaps not in the sense of 'getting too old for this' but common sense from experience.<br/><br/>However I still can't find a group actually interested in game design in my country, not to mention one that would share some of my interests. Heck, I can barely find a group in my same native language. Groups of players yes, I can totally find, but people knowledgeable on tabletop RPG design, those are as mythical as Bigfoot in my country and even in online communities speaking spanish. (I found a forum about RPG design in spanish once, but there were so few people there that it ended feeling quite slow, and I could barely found subjects and threads that picked my interests, mostly it was material that came from here)<br/><br/>So I'm up for another Forge, anytime.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466326">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466326/#Comment_466326" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-18T20:12:25+00:00" title="September 18, 2017  8:12PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As far as the "open source design" project, I voiced my reservations in that thread - they are basically the same as Eero's. To me, games are boutique items: finely crafted pieces of art, at their best. I can't really imagine how a "mass produced" version of this kind of thing would be an advantage - when we're working with personal creators and essentially simple ideas, I'd rather have the personal touch every time.<br/><br/>Some kind of repository of game mechanics and ideas sounds vaguely interesting, but, unless I have high faith in its curation, has little utility for me. (I'm pretty sure I could never use it directly, after all - even if I draw on some subsystem out of such a compilation I would need to adjust and/or modify it to make use of it in one of my own design projects.)<br/><br/>Jeff,<br/><br/>The idea of another Forge, that's interesting! I certainly miss having a community which draws together a variety of designers and encourages both critical thought and wide-open experimentation.<br/><br/>I think your thoughts about "story games" as a category (collaborative GMless roleplaying, basically) needing some more work, thought, and development are spot-on, and it's a really exciting field of game design. Of all the things that are interesting about story gaming/roleplaying to me, that's probably the most interesting. And I would bet we're not alone in that regard!<br/><br/>Two questions for you to ponder:<br/><br/>1. What would the goal of the community be, and what kind of people would it attract? How focused or loose would its process be?<br/><br/>2. How does or does not the current Story Games fulfill that niche? What would the hypothetical new Forge offer that Story Games does not, and how might it attract different people, more people, fewer people, or whatever your goals are?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466337">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466337/#Comment_466337" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-19T09:09:59+00:00" title="September 19, 2017  9:09AM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" rel="nofollow">WarriorMonk</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>The basic idea is this: at Github programmers share bits of code for others to use as they want, so nobody has to figure out and write a whole program/application by themselves.

By being struck down, a diaspora with no center nor border, the Forge has become more powerful than one can possibly imagine.<br/><br/>Seriously though, I'm honestly not that sold on the idea of a new Forge-style workshop. If somebody started it I'd probably check it out, but the fact is that what made the Forge relevant to me (and probably most others) was the place we were then in our roleplaying, and what we could give each other. No slight intended towards e.g. Jeff, but I am not so intensely enamoured and curious towards his roleplaying and ideas as I used to be about say Jason's over the last decade. Feeling that the peers at the forum could elevate your own gaming was a major motivator in putting in the effort.<br/><br/>Looking at what made the Forge a success, it would realistically improve your odds a lot if you had not only the right time and place as I speculated earlier, but also a big fat visionary leader with a bold program. That's the sort of thing that it's actually worthwhile to join and work with, even if it is also simultaneously divisive and socially risky.

The normal moderation rules didn't apply there. Instead, the rules were "post whatever you like, and have a good time doing so!" with the added proviso that you should "be nice, damnit!' <br/></p><p>The idea was that you could just shoot the breeze with folks with whom you'd been interacting in a really focused, structured way during the rest of the year.

There's <a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=19404.0" rel="nofollow">a nice thread</a> started by Emily Care Boss where she imagines what games she would play and who she would play them with if she were at Forge Midwest, and one where Judd talks about <a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=14961.0" rel="nofollow">the impact the Forge has had on him</a>. <br/></p><p>So, anyway, it occurs to me that you could do a kind of mini-Forge here on Story-Games by inverting that formula: establish a category called something like <i>GMless Forge</i> and moderate it in order to support the project of articulating and refining GMless games and best practices for play. <br/></p><p>You'd probably also want something analogous to the Forge Booth; that is, a real-world project that served as the focal point for a lot of people's efforts at GenCon.

Perhaps, a category simply call GMless. I think it's probably a long shot convincing Jason and James  that it's a worthwhile idea. I'm the one  tinkering with something in the ballpark of these ideas and I'm not even sure that it would be a good idea, haha <img alt=":smiley:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title=":smiley:"/>. Anyway, it's defiantly  something to think about and I wouldn't object to as I am interested in seriously thinking about improving GMless games, not only in my own game designs but in crowd-sourcing ideas to get others perspectives and to pushback on each other's ideas and see which ones are solid and stand up to the test. However, I can see that from Jason and James perspective such a category might be redundant being that we already have a category dedicated to design,  which may be read as a place where we can look for opportunities to question our widespread assumptions about, and to improve upon, different forms (i.e solving problems in RPG forms that address issues and lack of satisfaction in the experience of players and GM's, and addressing these different problems in a number of ways that cater to different tastes and aims in gaming). As for me, I think the best path is to improve upon the issues that I find relevant, by addressing them in my own games through design innovations.
