                    For a while now, there has been this thing nagging on me: I'm dissatisfied with the local (ie. austrian) online community. Now, Austria in general (And the area around Vienna in specific) isn't big, but there are at least three FLGS and one yearly gaming convention here in Vienna, not to mention quite a bunch of LARPs organisations. But as far as the internet goes, things look pretty bare, with only a few small and pretty inactive forums and web-communities around, most of them forums specific to organisations. (Like gaming clubs or shops.) There seems to be little cross-pollination, almost zero discussion besides the big three (D&amp;D, DSA/TDE and Shadowrun.) and not much awareness or anything besides their own forum.<br/><br/>Understandably, Austria is a bit handicapped in being relatively small and german-speaking, meaning that many of the austrian gamers will probably just read german boards (Of which there are quite a few nice ones.) or go and look at the big english-speaking ones, if they speak the language well enough and are interested. (Or, like me, do both.) Also, as not all local gamers are comfotable with english, most of the rely on the FLGS to keep up with the hobby/industry, further limiting their idea of "What Is Out There".<br/><br/>Still, it seems like such a waste. Judging by the hundreds of people visiting the convention (Even discounting board and tabletop gamers, LARPers and people dragged there against their will.) there should be quite a bunch of gamers around but the community seems to be extremly insular, without anything to really connect them. And I think that sucks, because I'd love to see a good austrian forum.<br/><br/>So I've been thinking: <b>What could I do to create and/or foster such a thing?</b><br/><br/>Now, setting up a forum is easy, but building a community, <i>that's</i> hard. Which is why I thought that maybe Story-Games might have some ideas on that subject.<br/><br/>The first step is, obviously, to actually identify what I want. In an ideal world, the end result would be something like Story-Games: Friendly, relaxed and open-minded regarding games, with at least a healthy interest in things Indie without being very snide about it. I realize that this probably won't happen, as S-G has other great forums (Like the Forge or RPGnet) and an established and pretty connected community in general to draw on and I'm certainly no Andy K. (I have neither his drive, friendlyness or "fame".) But still, it's something to aim at, even if I'll never reach it.<br/><br/>When do internet communities work? The way I see it, online communities need something to cluster around (The theme/goal of the forum and what it is <i>about</i>.) and something to draw members from. (A pool of reachable potential members that can learn about/be told of the forum and thus become interested in being members.) To use S-G as an example, "A Relaxed Place to Talk About Games" is the idea our community clusters around, while other internet-fora serve as the main Potential User Pools. (PUP from now on.) For most local forums, the PUPs sucks, as there aren't any big forums to advertise through and the local subculture isn't organized/connected enough to make word-to-mouth a very promising thing, so most of them rely on the old and tried method of "random user stumbling over the forum by google" and hope that he talks his gaming friends into visiting. (The forums created by gaming societies have slightly better chance to get users though their members, but don't hold much of interest for non-member.) So, without much of an online PUP to draw on, searching the real world for potential users and finding some meatspace way to recruit them seems necessary.<br/><br/>Some of the forums try to attract more members by making the "Theme" less focused, adding Tabletop, CCG, LARP and other sections, but (IMO) often make the mistake of adding more sub-forums then the userbase can use, thus creating an "empty" forums where many forums are almost never posted to and thus are actually less likely to attract and hold users. (<a href="http://www.fantasy-rpg.at/" rel="nofollow">Fantasy-RPG.at</a> is, IMO, an example of this, with 19 sub-fora, most of which see less then one new post per month.) So I think that a game with as few sub-fora as possible (Although as many as are necessary), or at least one where categories exist but don't fracture the forum (Like here on S-G.) is more likely to create and hold a "living" userbase.<br/><br/>Another thing: I think a forum lives and dies with the "core users", active users that spend time on the forum, add interestin content even in the absence of new users and are welcoming and helpfull towards them. Basically, the Andys, Mikes, Tonys or Levis of the forum. (I just picked some well-known Users that I could remember the names of. Not really representative of anything except my bad memory.) Getting a few interested "core users" as early as possible is probably an important part of wether a forum attracts new users or not. After all, interesting content tends to spawn more interesting content and attracts users. (And even more important, makes them stay.)<br/><br/>Something I'm wondering about is how much the technical side of things influence community success. I remember I've stumbled over quite a few forums in my internet time that looked interesting but that, in the end, proved to be too much of a PITA to use, thus making it not worth my while as a user. (Mostly small things like bad structure or convulted menues that weren't much of a problem individually but which added up.) So that's probably something to keep in mind too.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Well, that's all I can think of right now. (After taking the whole damn day to finally complete this post.) Right now, this is just a Little Idea and thankfully so, as I'm still trying to see wether this has any chance of success and wether I'd actually be the right person to start something like that. (Seeing how I'm generally lazy, chaotic and don't have much on the side of IT knowledge.) Still, right now I think it might work, if I actually get my ass up, eventually. Maybe...                </div>

In fact, I think, people actually form communities around what they reject. The Forge rejects "system doesn't matter" and assertions that the roleplaying hobby is actually an industry with a meaningful differentiation between producers and consumers.<br/><br/>But participating at The Forge is work. It's enjoyable and rewarding work. But it's still work. And sometimes you just need a break. Story Games breaks away from the work culture of The Forge, and provides a space for appreciating the same hobby that doesn't expect work, challenging of assumptions, and striving from participants.<br/><br/>There are lots of positives at Story Games, and at The Forge (one is the culture of shared support). But as harsh as it sounds, you don't build a community on positives. You need something to reject that can serve as a foundation for the positives.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>

It does sound a bit depressing, but you may have a point. The whole "Come to us because we don't do X" thing. On the other hand, isn't that just playing logic games as by rejecting X you're often embracing it's opposite? (Or is that just me playing logic games?)<br/><br/>Also, I'm wondering if that might not me more true in an eviroment with many established communities one can "steal" users from then it is in a meatspace enviroment where the largest PUP are real-life gamers recruited in person. Might just be more onvious there, though, as it's easier to point at rejectable things.<br/><br/>And one way or the other, this still leaves me wondering what the community might cluster around. (Wether it's the embracing of idea X or it's opposites rejection.)                        </div>

                            I don't mean to argue with Paul in any way, but it seems to me that the Forge response to many suggestions is this:<br/><b>We're not about X, we're about Indie game design.</b><br/>That's not negativism, that's a single-minded focus on a specific mission.  <br/><br/>So maybe a mission statement is a good place to start for you, too?  <br/><br/>Also, I wonder if a new online forum is really the best way to create an online community of Austrian gamers.  I live in Seattle, and here we have a Yahoo email group, Seattle-Gamers-Assemble, that works pretty nicely for a number of community-building functions.                        </div>

                            I may be wrong, but I think this is "How to pronounce Tomato" territory. Wether you define your vision by positives or negatives, I think the important part is that you have to have a vision/a reason why a potential user should use your forum and not the one next door.                        </div>

                            I've seen communities formed around negatives, and communities formed around negatives ... but here's the thing:  I've only ever seen communities formed around positives when there is some real-world activity that you pursue by way of the community.<br/>
<br/>
So if you make a site about gaming in the abstract, you're probably going to define by rejecting something.  But if you make a site that is specifically for people to meet up and actually game, in the real world, I think you can use that as a positive foundation.<br/>
<br/>
Heh.  Another way of looking at it is that if you don't give people anything else to do then you <i>must</i> give them the most basic thing they come to the internet for:  <strike>porn</strike> complaining about how stupid other people are.                        </div>

                            Actually I think you hit on it with the "core member" thing in a way.<br/>
<br/>
At the risk of seeming like I'm admitting that The Forge is some sort of clique, the fact is that what got me posting there was that I followed Ron on over from Gaming Outpost. As did Paul, and a number of other people, I believe.<br/>
<br/>
And, though the Forge is based around Ron's basic rejection of earlier principles, sure, I think the fact is that we all found each other to be palatable to some extent. That is, the social element is strong. What's more, we weren't content to merely know each other online. I've played games with Andy, I played the first playtest of MLWM with Paul at GenCon. Ron invited us all to help man his booth at GenCon one year, which is what really cemented things.<br/>
<br/>
See, we're not just colleagues with similar interests, we're friends. I ran TSOY for Paul one day when he came to visit me in Milwaukee from Detroit (along with coming to view an art exhibit and some other things).<br/>
<br/>
To put that in perspective, he traveled the length of Austria in part to play some RPGs with me. You don't do that with random folks you haven't met. I had to very reluctantly turn down an invitation to Paul and Dani's wedding, but I had planned to be there.<br/>
<br/>
I've played games with or met, or spoken face to face with the vast majority of people on The Forge who've published games. I had Indian food with Jonathan Walton, Shreyas, Selene, and others at GenCon, and we talked philosophy amongst other things (I brought it back around to RPGs, since, well, I'm obsessed).<br/>
<br/>
Luke, Thor, Dro, Alex and all that crew. Clinton, Mike Miller and Kat, Tony, and the rest of Paul's crew (Scott, Matt Gwinn, Tom). Matt Snyder, Thomas Robertson. Heck, Josh Neff used to live here, and I played HQ with him weekly. These are all people I know well.<br/>
<br/>
Jason Morningstar, Judd, Remi, Fred Hicks, Rob Donahue, Tim Kleinert - all folks I have met, and even played with, and will probably some day get to know even better in person. Though I know them all pretty well from extensive online interaction.<br/>
<br/>
Even those who've moved on from the community like Jared and John Wick.<br/>
<br/>
These are just off the top, the one's I haven't mentioned shouldn't feel slighted.<br/>
<br/>
And all of these people know each other to some extent. I mean have met in person, and for some, perhaps, are good friends. Many. And there are second-order connections, too. I've never met Brand in person, but he's intended to come to GenCon, and he knows people that we both know, and we've played together online a lot. I connect to JBR through him. The whole West Coast contingent (Jesse, and Chris Kubasik, etc), have all met with folks we know at GenConLeft. If Clinton or somebody tells me that somebody's cool (or even is friendly with them)...they're cool.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The point is that what keeps this place together is not so much that the site has things that bring us together for some common goal. It's that we get together and socialize from time to time. That social bond makes us come here. Makes me come here, at least. I know that people like Paul know me well enough to read through my bad posting habits. Some day I'll meet JD, and then he'll get me better too (and I him).<br/>
<br/>
Here's the thing. Andy is not famous. Sorry Andy. Neither am I, nor Ron, nor even Robin Laws. Oh, sure, Robin has made famous designs. But the community of people involved in designing games is tiny. Given the number of people who make games at The Forge, or as a quantity of the total products produced, this group of designers constitutes a large proportion of the overall community of designers.<br/>
<br/>
That is, there's less people involved in design than you think. In RPGs, in fact. We're really all one big community.<br/>
<br/>
So...don't try to form your site around "Principle X." Do this instead. Form your site, and then talk to people about it. Go to conventions, and organize social events there where you meet the people who post on your site. Play RPGs with them, and get to know them. Then tell them to bring in their other cool friends. Before you know it, you'll have a community too.<br/>
<br/>
All communities are essentially social. This is the "problem' with RPG.net... it's more like Grand Central Station than a community. Tangency, actually, is far more of a community than the general fora at RPG.net (believe it or don't). I know Tom Back personally, he lives near me, and we've played RPGs together. His part of the RPG community is just a little different than ours. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Everyone is out there wanting to join. They just need something good to join about. And with RPGs, a social activity in itself, the only thing to get excited about, really, are the fun people you know and enjoy the hobby with. Make that the center of your community.<br/>

                            A core group of excited and commited people is key to creating any community endeavor.  Meeting in person and knowing and enjoying one another as people is a strong glue, as Mike says.  I've seen it done in online-only groups, but it takes excellent facilitation, where the members feel responded to and engaged with. A good structure will decentralize that so that all who participate will model it in some way (eg the "Welcome to the Forge!" thing, they do that at my dojo, too).  <br><br>What I've found is necessary for a stable or growing community is to have 1) a core group, whose members may change over time but enough remain at any one time to keep alive the vision and energy of the endeavor, and 2) a larger group of people interested in the activity than are taking part in it at any one time.  Your group will stall or burn out if everyone has to be involved all at once in order for it to function and be fun. If instead you have a large (and growing) group of people then folks can step in or fall out as life and preferences dictate that they want to.  People falling away is normal and even good. But you have to have enough other folks around and becoming engaged or re-engaged to keep the group vital.                        </br></br></div>

After (and even while) setting the thing up, I plan to get much more involved in the local meatspace community, talk to people, run games and so on. One thing I plan to do is print some "business cards" with information about the forum (Name, logo, address, and so on.), which I'd give people I get to know and which I think might be interested. (Nobody can read my handwriting and spelling internet adresses when talking is kinda awkward.) I also plan to learn more about/go to local gaming clubs, see if there are any interesting/interested people there and so on. It also gives me a mental excuse to finally get off my ass and actually run a few Wushu games at the next convention. ^_^<br><br>EDIT: Regarding the "Mission Statement" vs. "Core Community" thing: The way I see it, both the social and thematic aspect can make somebody interested in a community at first, but the thing that keeps people posting and coming back is probably mostly the community itself, ie. the social aspect. So people can come because they've heard about it from a friend or because they've googled "gaming", but what makes them stay is that there are cool people they like and whose contributions they enjoy.                        </br></br></div>

A decent hypothesis.  If so, then I somehow make the "me" transitive, as I do very little direct interaction with the Jim Butcher forum community today.  I do think a key part of making a community work centers around finding the enthusiastic core, validating their enthusiasm, and hitching it to the same wagon so the place can get some momentum.                        </div>

                            First, I'm taking the shared idea as a given. I'm not saying don't have a mission statement. I'm saying that you already have one. Can't hurt to tweak it. Just don't assume that you can put it on a web page and people will come.<br/>
<br/>
And, yeah, Fred, the transitive thing is key. Again, it has to become a community, and that means more than one person. It's your personable nature that gets other people being personable, too. And then you have the community. That's my point. It's not "just Fred" but Fred, and all of the people who act cool, because they've seen Fred's example.<br/>
<br/>
This relates to JD's comment about luck. Because it may be that one of two bad luck things happen:<br/>
<br/>
- Like Fred, you might attract a troll like me to your site, and then you have to work against that all the time. Some folks just don't know when to shut up.<br/>
<br/>
- Second, before you reach that critical mass of personable people, there may be lulls where everyone happens to be away at the same time. The lucky part is starting off with good stuff yourself, and then, when you're absent (can't be there 24/7...unless you're Fred), that other cool people are there to step in and keep the flow going.<br/>
<br/>
More art than science, I'm sure. But the method is pretty simple. Set a good example, and people will follow.<br/>
