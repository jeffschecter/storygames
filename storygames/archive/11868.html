The first was effectively an unplanned, off the cuff solo game which confirmed that the system was fast and easy to pick up and \u201csell\u201d to someone who\u2019d never seen it before. After the briefest flick through the rules and a quick chat, it took about five minutes for the player to come up with a character. Although the setting I wrote for the game didn\u2019t include any gothic horror elements, that was what interested the player so he generated a character that could safely be described as the Victorian equivalent of Fox Mulder (only with much better dress sense and a far better name \u2013 Professor Obadiah Nimrod). <br/>\n<br/>\nBecause at some point I\u2019d like to run this particular game again, I\u2019ll not go into too many details, but the game was set in Newcastle in around 1879 and the local population of street musicians was disappearing. Since the previous discussions on this forum, I\u2019ve introduced something called \u201cFoibles\u201d to the character creation process, which are basically character quirks that give the players a bit more of a handle on who they\u2019re playing and give the GM ways of getting them into trouble, ahem, involving them in the game. Professor Nimrod had the Foible \u201cNever Say No to a Damsel in Distress\u201d, which was gave me an ideal way to link him in to the plot \u2013 the first street musician to disappear now had a young female assistant who needed our hero\u2019s help! How could he refuse?<br/>\n<br/>\nAbly assisted by his grubby urchin sidekick Albert and Daisy (the assistant), Prof. Nimrod tore around the city on the trail of the dastardly villain that was bringing silence to the streets. Mind you, they were all of the opinion that George the accordion player going missing was no bad thing as he never was much good.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe dice lent themselves very nicely to the story that was developing; I didn\u2019t call for rolls very often, only when they were dramatically appropriate. The weighting of the dice rolls meant that whilst they were mostly successful, there was the occasional critical failure when the player (or me) rolled a natural 1. The most entertaining was when Albert was attempting to find a way in to a locked building late at night. Fluffing the roll utterly, Albert walked right up to the main doors and started shaking them to see if they were open, just as a police constable walked by. In a true twist of fate, the Prof rolled a natural 6 when using his Cakes skill to bluff his way out of the situation (because, after all, method actors are bound to be practising their roles after midnight in front of an important government building, don\u2019t \u2018cha know, Officer!).<br/>\n<br/>\nThis session was great fun, very spontaneous and really showed how flexible both the rules and the setting are. The player was very enthusiastic and got what the game was about (telling entertaining pulp stories with the minimum of fuss) and has taken away the rules to test them with his own group of players.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second game was much larger, with six players taking pregenerated characters on an adventure to Her Majesty\u2019s Flying Steam City Atlantis. Again, I\u2019ll be a bit vague about the minutiae here as I\u2019d like to run it again elsewhere. I\u2019d tested this scenario before to make sure it ran to time and as a result had shortened it a bit by taking out a sky pirate encounter. I still gave the players the briefing about pirates before they set off by airship, which led to some superb deduction by the players later on in the game (they\u2019re so close to what is happening, but they\u2019ve figured it for all the wrong reasons). <br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, the players were very tuned in to what was going on and needed very little nudging, often coming up with some very ingenious ways of getting to the information (better than mine on occasion) or providing me with alternative ways of getting the information to them if they chose a different path to the one I was expecting. Again, the dice almost seemed to know when a good roll was needed; one player rolled a natural 6 and picked up a very crucial piece of evidence that had so far remained undiscovered.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne other new mechanic that worked very well was Reputation points. Several people commented that there was no way in the original version of the game for the characters to advance and Reputation points were developed to cover that. A character earns the points by excellent characterisation or rolling a natural 6 (adding to their reputation as leaders in their field). If they fail an important roll, they may spend a Reputation point and along with some suitably pithy comment (\u201c\u2026but surely someone of my reputation would never make such a fundamental mistake!\u201d), have another roll (thus saving them from derision).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe players were great, really using their foibles to add to their characterisation and taking great advantage of their attributes to figure out the plot. There was minimal dice rolling, the players only asking for them when they knew it was crucial. I only had two concerns: the level of engagement was not the same as for the one-on-one game (as the party fragmented very quickly once the action started) and I muffed up the delivery of the ending because I was tired. Other than that, the timing was perfect.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore than anything, this scenario showed that the pregens needed a little more tweaking to get them working perfectly as a group and that the scenario needs restructuring a little. These are things that you only find out when you play with a group of complete strangers. The test had been run with good friends who I\u2019ve gamed with for years, so our gaming short-hand circumvented some of the niggles I found when playing it with different people. And it was fascinating to see how different people interpreted the different characters; although grossly the same, the mannerisms and actions were often tellingly different.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, the feedback was good with the players commenting on how much they\u2019d enjoyed the setting and the game. One of the group also said that he\u2019ll be taking it away and testing it with his players, so I look forward to getting their feedback as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI\u2019m happy with the rules now as they stand and they\u2019ve been updated in the free version to include all of the revisions. The setting seems to be popular with people, so all I need to do now is flesh it out a bit more and get it (and some more guidance for GMs and players) onto paper.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265736">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy" title="Joe Murphy"><img alt="Joe Murphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/804143/412754"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy">Joe Murphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265736/#Comment_265736" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-06T06:02:31+00:00" title="April  6, 2010  6:02AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi, Lynne. <br/><br/>Why 'Cakes'? This "covers your personality and your ability to interact with other people and how other people regard you." I don't understand the connection between that word and what it represents.<br/><br/>More generally, I can't tell why I'd used this system rather than, say, Risus, Over the Edge, PDQ, Fudge or Fate. I can't see where the system would help me, as a GM - I still have to do a lot of thinking.<br/><br/>(You should also post links back to the game draft or your blog, so that interested parties can take the next step).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265755">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265755/#Comment_265755" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-06T08:13:06+00:00" title="April  6, 2010  8:13AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lynne,<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">I didn\u2019t call for rolls very often, only when they were dramatically appropriate.</div>\n</blockquote>\nHow much of the successful play was you and how much was the system?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lynne%20H" title="Lynne H"><img alt="Lynne H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lynne%20H">Lynne H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268529/#Comment_268529" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-23T08:58:16+00:00" title="April 23, 2010  8:58AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry not to get back to you gentlemen sooner, but we got ever so slightly stranded in Canada by the whole volcano thing.<br>\n<br/>\nJoe: Cakes is a throw-back to the live RPG that I was part of for a very long time. The whole social aspect of Victorian role-playing (the live stuff, anyway) always seems to end up revolving around food and especially cake. The social interaction that took place over those cakes was often crucial to plot development, so it seemed an appropriate title to give to the social abilities in this game.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou're right, there is no real advantage in using this system to, say, Over the Edge or the others that you've mentioned. In fact, if there's a system you are comfortable with and prefer to use, I'd much rather people did that if it suits their style of play. I've included a small system for completion's sake, that is simple and straightforward to remember (hopefully) and that works with the live and table-top roleplayers I've played with. <br/>\n<br/>\nLuke: Interesting point. I would say that definitely in the first scenario it was mostly the system and the player. I reacted to what he proposed, calling for rolls for the big stuff only. His engagement with the game meant that he was moving the plot forward in a way that with other players might have required a few more rolls to nudge them in the right direction. For the second group, I did occasionally have to ask for rolls to push the plot (as mentioned above) but not very often. I don't think I'm necessarily the best person to judge what was me and what was the system objectively, but my husband has also run a very successful test game so either we're both great, or the system had something to do with it :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, apologies for not getting back to you both sooner (and thanks for the suggestion about links, I shall certainly include them in future)                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
