I thought I'd share what I personally enjoy about dedicated reward systems in the hope that it might shed some light on their purpose.<br/><br/>See, I've had the experience, time and again, of wanting to do things in a game that go against the grain of the rules, and/or what the other players are pursuing. Like, "Hey, I'm gonna make a guy who's not very strong or tough, but he's a charming devil, and manipulates others to get his way." And the other players are like, "That's nice, we'll be over here slaughtering orcs by the truckload, while you miss two out of every three swings." And everyone would get better at the slaughtering, while I wouldn't get much of anywhere, 'cause while I might get a "good roleplaying" bonus here and there, everyone else is racking up piles of XP from their massive kill count and E criticals.<br/><br/>Now, nothing in the game prevented me from pursuing what I wanted. There's some manner of system support for such actions, though not nearly as much as for the others' goals. And with sufficient GM and fellow-player support I could pursue off-the-beaten-path goals in a satisfying way. That's all cool. But if the reward system doesn't back me up, then it puts a damper on the play I want. Not necessarily killing it or ruining the fun, but any fun will be had by overcoming the friction of reward un-support.<br/><br/>But isn't the play itself the reward? Sure, it can be, and that's probably why I've often pursued that un-rewarded play often. But see,the thing is that RPG reward systems aren't pure, enjoyable-in-themselves rewards.You don't turn in your XP for candy. You turn them in for increased effectiveness in the game. So if you're playing to your eccentric, unsupported goal, instead of the systemically central one, you're not (unless the GM just likes what you're doing and just sorta gives you the XP anyway) gaining effectiveness at the same rate as other players. And, especially if increased effectiveness is needed to better pursue your goal, that can suck.<br/><br/>So being rewarded for my preferred play isn't an incentive to do so (I already have that; it's the desired play itself). It's a resource for pursuing that play. Some games are pretty specific with that resource, having a dedicated reward system for the kind of play the game is designed for. (Like, D&amp;D's calibrated for defeating Challenges, and Dogs in the Vineyard toward complications and difficult choices, therefore the former grants increased challenge-beating oomph while the latter piles on more life-complicating traits.) Which is great if everyone's on board for that particular kind of play. If the group's more diverse, I'd prefer something more flexible. The Shadow of Yesterday basically has customizable rewards that allow each player to design their own experience sytem. You want to get XP for killin' stuff? Great! Key of Bloodlust. XP for pursuing the unapproachable princess? Bing! Key of Unrequited Love. Machiavellian scheming? Key of Power. Avenging your father's murder? Key of Vengeance. Or you can buy extra Keys for infinite combinations.<br/><br/>I'm unaware of any other game with that degree of flexibility. D&amp;D has its Story Awards as an alternative or supplement to the monster-killin' awards, but I find them terribly vague and of limited use. Aside from mission-based goals, they all say to me merely, "GM, wing it." Which is difficult, 'cause the GM isn't the participant who's invested in a given PC's "thing"--the PC's player is. And the player and GM may have difficulty communicating how to address that "thing." Whereas if the player can set a secific area of focus (like, "political scheming--on!") communication can be more clear and satisfaction of that goal more secure.<br/><br/>Anyone know of other games that address this? And how do the range of possibilities map to folks' experience and play preferences?<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108701/#Comment_108701" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-17T22:46:27+00:00" title="November 17, 2007 10:46PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joel, I like your write up.<br/><br/>Levi Kornelson wrote a little game called Microcosm which (I believe) had genre-customizable reward targets.

"I want you to be boxed into a corner by a scheming courtesan before you wriggle your way out, so she can hate you." and so on.  <br/><br/>Interestingly, White Wolf XP systems give you awards for, mainly, showing up. It's an equal reward for "whatever you are doing in the game, we assume you enjoy it".<br/><br/>My group is very sensitive to issues of play balance and can turn to resentment if it's off, so I never do anything other than give XP for showing up.

My opinion, but it sounds like your criticisms are so mired in the idea that there <em>must</em> be a reward system, that the "not having one" option gets overlooked.<br/><br/>It sounds like you're frustrated that other people get more resources than you do, not necessarily that you aren't getting enough resources.  I've been considering this in a lot of ways recently, so let me see if I can throw a spanner in the works.  The only conclusion I've been able to draw from my pondering is that I have yet to see a reward system that encourages the kind of play I'm after.  And beyond that, most of the systems I've seen are very incoherent about what kinds of play they reward.  So:<br/><br/>Why do we need a reward system?<br/>What is the function of a reward system?<br/><br/>This is what I mean when I say your defense doesn't do much defending, because it doesn't do much to answer either of these questions.  And I don't blame you!  They're very hard to answer.  So hard, in fact, that decades worth of games have struggled with them.<br/><br/>This is very much along the lines of the thread around here a while ago that asked whether or not character advancement was necessary.  Many, many people said "I don't need advancement, but I do need change."  I'm with them.  Change doesn't require advancement.  There may be some systems that reward players in ways completely unrelated to advancement, but I haven't seen many.  So if we don't need advancement, why do we need rewards?  Maybe it isn't the reward system that's broken -- maybe it's the idea of having a reward system in the first place.<br/><br/>From your description, it sounds like the barrier that keeps you from viewing the game this way is that other people get rewards, not that you insist on getting them.  If we ditched the idea of rewards, this barrier disappears and the play itself becomes the reward.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_108755">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108755/#Comment_108755" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-18T14:30:42+00:00" title="November 18, 2007  2:30PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rewards are a signaling mechanism that points toward fun. By watching what rewards a player pursues, you find out what is important to them. By encoding rewards in mechanics or social contract, you tell players what kind of fun you're offering them and where to find it. By leaving reward mechanisms unspecified, you're letting players define their own rewards ad hoc, or leaving space for a social reward method to fill.<br/><br/>Does that satisfy Max's sidebar and let us go back to the main thread, which I find interesting in its own right - what happens when there's a conflict between what the player is pursuing and what is on offer from the system? <br/><br/>Joel wants to be rewarded for clever social-fu, but the only rewards available that have a mechanical impact point <b>away</b> from social-fu and towards killing everything you meet. Sure, you can pursue non-mechanical rewards (personal satisfaction, strokes from your peers...), but by doing so, you only hurt the <b>group</b> experience, because your character is becoming more and more marginal as the killing-things characters power up by earning mechanically-reinforced rewards.<br/><br/>The thing isn't actually "have a mechanical reward system" vs "don't have a mechanical reward system". It's "have a mechanical reward system that can encompass multiple kinds of player fun" vs "everyone pursues the kind of fun encoded in the mechanical reward system" vs "don't have a mechanical reward system". IF you want to have a mechanical reward system (to point toward fun and reward playing <b>together</b> instead of in parallel), THEN you need to think about what you'll be rewarding. IF you don't want to have a mechanical reward system, THEN you need to figure out how to keep everyone playing the same game over time OR you need to accept that play will have large parallel stretches.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108759">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108759/#Comment_108759" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-18T15:07:17+00:00" title="November 18, 2007  3:07PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Indeed, sorry to derail.

In my current group, for example, one player loves to big the biggest badass at something (anything, even painting) so long as the mechanics support it.  Another player wants to be a hero in every session.  Another player wants to be rewarded for adhering to the social norms of whatever fictional culture we're playing in.  Another player wants to be rewarded for challenging beliefs.  These seem like difficult things to shoehorn into the same reward system.

For the purposes of this conversation, let's assume I do in fact want a reward system.  It's not that I don't want to see a good way to make multiple payoffs fit into the same reward system, it's just that I haven't yet.  <br/><br/>One of the major challenges seems to be that some things are easier to reward than others, by virtue of being more concrete.  It's easy to see who won the fight between the party and the goblins just by looking at who's still standing.  It's not as easy to see who "won" a social encounter, and involves more possible degrees of success than the flat out fight.  None of that is new, it's been discussed here before.  And things like "being a hero" or "upholding cultural standards" or "challenging beliefs" are problematic for the same reason - judging what a success is, and how partial a partial success was are not concrete.  I think they can be made to be concrete and easily verifiable, and keys do quite a bit to move along this path, by requiring that the victory conditions be defined a bit better.<br/><br/>The parallel problem is that, as Joel pointed out, the reward doesn't encourage the style of play necessarily, but instead provides the resources to pursue it.  And in order to support all these different goals that we're opening up to be rewarded (with whatever hypothetical method we choose), we'll need to distribute a resource that can be used equally well to achieve all of them.  To see the issue more clearly, consider D&amp;D.  Experience lets you level up, which increases your BAB, maybe an attribute, some skills, and maybe a feat.  Those resources can be used very effectively to pursue an agenda of "killing monsters and finding loot."  The application is simple, direct, obvious.  What about "being a hero" or "upholding cultural standards?"  How would you use these resources to pursue those goals?  It's possible, but it sure ain't simple, direct, and obvious.<br/><br/>This is all really by way of defining the problem, which seems to consist of (at least) these two questions:<br/><br/><i>How are we going to measure success consistently in a wide range of activities?<br/>What resource can be awarded that will equally foster a wide range of goals?</i><br/><br/>I don't have answers yet, but the wheels are spinning.

In a recent Conan game, I played a fast-talking con-artist who hid behind the giant barbarian and tried not to get killed. Though the players enjoyed him and the change of pace (they still were all stone-cold killers), I had a rough time finding moments to "fit-in" with the group, and the gamemaster had to tailor certain events specifically to my character (chances to barter, possible scams, etc.) The in-game rewards actually allowed the other characters to progress faster than my guy, so that, coupled with an inability to be at every game, pretty much ended my involvement.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't need an incentive to play, but I feel I do need an incentive to continue with the same character and to invest my time with them.

This way, you may affect the storyline even when the focus isn't on your character, and find ways to advance. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe actual rewards for accomplishing your goals are split between greater character capability, which can be focused on combat, social skills, trades, whatever is important to your character, and the ability to set more goals, which allows you to focus play at least partially on the things you're interested in your character doing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_108908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108908/#Comment_108908" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-19T17:54:12+00:00" title="November 19, 2007  5:54PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, now I've got some time to tackle this:<br/><br/>Max,\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Max P</cite>Interestingly, your defense of reward systems doesn't provide much in the way of reasons we should like them.

I'm not saying there \u201cmust\u201d be anything, but that given that a game does have one, it should be flexible.<br/><br/>That said, rewards in a game take many forms, and my basic principle applies to most if not all of them. A game can provide rewards as concrete as XP and levels or as ephemeral as "everyone thinks what you did is cool." Inasmuch as those rewards translate into effectiveness, they're all in a sense equal. If everyone (or at least the GM) thinking I'm cool lets me propose more wacky stunts or outlandish plans and get away with them (that is, have them vetted by the group), then that serves me just as well as gaining a level and getting more Attack Bonus or skill points. Or increasing influence of my character in the fictional society, or whatever. What I'm really after with "rewards" in this sense is the ability to enact my will in the game, which leads to the real reward, which is having stuff happen in the game that is satisfying to me (often shorthanded to "play itself). Which leads me to:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Max P</cite>It sounds like you're frustrated that other people get more resources than you do, not necessarily that you aren't getting enough resources.</blockquote>\nWhile there is a palpable emotional impact in seeing other players race ahead of you, that's not primarily what I'm talking about. I'm talking about power, the ability to Get Stuff Done. Others having more power than me is a related side concern (especially inasmuch as they may oppose my goals), but the bottom line is having <i>enough</i> power. Enough to do whatever it is I want to do. That power, as I said, can come in any form, and may or may not include character "advancement" (PTA doesn't, for example), but it should be <i>enough</i>--enough to give me a reasonable shot at it, though probably not enough to ensure success (that'd be boring!).That's what I'm after.

Thoughts?<br/><br/>Mark,\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite>Rewards are a signaling mechanism that points toward fun. By watching what rewards a player pursues, you find out what is important to them. By encoding rewards in mechanics or social contract, you tell players what kind of fun you're offering them and where to find it. By leaving reward mechanisms unspecified, you're letting players define their own rewards ad hoc, or leaving space for a social reward method to fill.</blockquote>\nI'm viewing rewards as both a signaling mechanism <i>and</i> a resource--e.g. Keys tell the GM "put lots of evil nemesis/unhappy love affair/choice between country and family <i>right here</i>!" but they also give you juice to pursue your ends--"unhappy love affair!

I was just trying to cover all the bases and acknowledge that not all rewards are system-driven.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Max P</cite>No.  If the function of a reward system is to make everyone effective at doing what they want to do, there is no benefit over having no reward system.  Everyone could be effective if we simply rubber stamped every declared action, with no resolution or reward system.</blockquote>\nWell, I think most of us can probably agree that simply rubber-stamping every action would be quite dull. You could probably call that a corollary of the Czege Principle. I'm not sure why you're pulling resolution into this, though. Can we take it as given that some manner of resolution (beyond "rubber-stamping") will probably be employed in most games? And given that that's so, my enjoyment of the game is strongly related to my ability to achieve my goals using that resolution.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Max P</cite>Rewards as signaling mechanism inherently buy into the concept that the GM is the ultimate arbiter of what is reward-able, and discount the notion that what the players want is important.</blockquote>\nI wouldn't say that. I think rewards as signaling mechanisms work <i>in any direction</i> between participants with any distribution of authority/responsibility. That often includes a central figure like a GM, but even then it's not a one-way street. Note that in Shadow of Yesterday <i>the players</i> not only determine their Keys, but decide when they've fulfilled the XP requirement for them. And reward mechanisms can also signal between non-GM players.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Max P</cite>This is cool, but if this is your solution, why ask for more?

They can turn into secrets, keys, bonus dice, new abilities.... and because of how flexibly defined those things are in turn in the system, they can represent nearly any fictional benefit or resource you can come up with.

You could probably call that a corollary of the Czege Principle. I'm not sure why you're pulling resolution into this, though. Can we take it as given that some manner of resolution (beyond "rubber-stamping") will probably be employed in most games? And given that that's so, my enjoyment of the game is strongly related to my ability to achieve my goals using that resolution.<br/><br/>I bring resolution into it because:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Melinglor</cite>What I'm really after with "rewards" in this sense is the ability to enact my will in the game, which leads to the real reward, which is having stuff happen in the game that is satisfying to me (often shorthanded to "play itself).</blockquote>\nWhat gives you more ability to enact your will in the game than the complete lack of restrictions?  If we insist on some chance of failure, which it seems reasonable to do for the sake of keeping it interesting, maximum ability to enact your will would seem to dictate that we keep that chance as small as possible.

I think rewards as signaling mechanisms work<i>in any direction</i>between participants with any distribution of authority/responsibility. That often includes a central figure like a GM, but even then it's not a one-way street. Note that in Shadow of Yesterday<i>the players</i>not only determine their Keys, but decide when they've fulfilled the XP requirement for them. And reward mechanisms can also signal between non-GM players.<br/>You're right, reward conditions can signal in any direction.  Whoever determines the rewards has power over which styles are encouraged.  I'm curious how this works out when that authority is distributed.  It seems like if you only determine your own reward conditions, there wouldn't be much incentive for anyone else to move the game that direction.

And I don't think keeping the chance as small as possible is exactly the goal. . .rather it'skeeping the chance of failure just on the cusp between "too easy" and "too hard." There's, like, a million considerations that go into this, and I'm certainly no expert on balancing them. I just know as an end-user when the result does or doesn't suit my taste. For instance, Big Eyes Small Mouth, which my group plays a lot, produces a lot of failure results--until you buy up a certain amount of skill and can practically never fail. Neither of those conditions is desirable.<br/><br/>I'd also like to point out that the nature of failure conditions themselves play a big role here. If failure means "eh, nothing happens," or "you're dead! New character!" then either you <i>really, really</i> don't want to fail, or it doesn't matter much at all. TSoY has stake-setting rules that basically let you put interesting failure options on the table that everyone can live with and which drive the story in interesting directions. Death isn't on the table unless it seems appropriate, and can be reserved for circumstances of dire and climactic import. A couple of stakes I set when running TSoY recently: [fighting a giant crocodile] "If you fail, the crocodile wounds you and makes off with one of the hapless soldiers." [confronted with a couple of tribal warriors who have no beef with the PCs, they're just caught in the middle of their raid] "If you fail, you're wounded and they capture you." See how that works? The players still may <i>want</i> to win (they did in the first example, but not in the second), but if they lose it's not unfun.<br/><br/>I think that may be sort of a tangent, but I hope it addresses some of what you're pondering.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108994/#Comment_108994" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-20T10:09:57+00:00" title="November 20, 2007 10:09AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, this:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Max P</cite>You're right, reward conditions can signal in any direction.

It works out with the GM because a lot of the GM's <i>job</i> is "hit the Keys, hit the Keys!" It works out with the other players provided they're interested in supporting your awesome. Which is pretty well a bottom line for me--everyone invested in making the most of everyone else's contributions at the table. When you have a group with full committment to that, everyone's contributions are valued, and the game really rocks. And with Keys, it's all laid out there in black and white: "Here's Player A's awesome,right here! Hit me! Hit me!"<br/><br/>But to be sure, I've played in groups (still do, somewhat) where ignoring others' contributions is more the order of the day. That can be a bummer, but I think TSoY has a nice compensatory measure for that--namely, that even if the other players let you be, with Keys you don't necessarily <i>need</i> their help to make your thing shine. And since you've got the tools necessary to make your tragic love affair or bid for the throne rock on toast, once it gets cooking you might even get a few people hooked, seeing how awesome it's turning out.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_108998">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108998/#Comment_108998" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-20T10:18:44+00:00" title="November 20, 2007 10:18AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sweet.

Rewards done in terms of in-character resources kinda get at these things too (e.g. my character is so awesome at fighting that I can drive every scene toward combat and the other players will go along with it), but only in a very round-about way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_109178">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109178/#Comment_109178" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-21T12:28:28+00:00" title="November 21, 2007 12:28PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thought that occurred to me recently is that talking is the most basic privilege in roleplaying.
