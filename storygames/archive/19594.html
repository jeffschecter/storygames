Then I thought about it some more. AW and it's many hacks teaches us if anything that complex things become simple when thought of as moves so I decided as an individual with far too many games and not enough people to play them with to write on a series of index cards labeled with MC moves that fit the setting of the game I was playing at the time (which happened to be Technoir for those curious) and draw one for each time I made a particularly bad roll or just got stumped as to how I was suppose to progress and used these moves in context to further drive the plot.<br/><br/>Just wanted to share this see if anyone had any thoughts on this idea, I'm aware people do similar things with solo games but I like this system and would like to try and refine it. <br/>(side note: To add meaning to the moves I usually rolled a Story Cube or two which helped add depth as to what each event meant when there didn't seem to be any good context for the move)                  </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435488">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435488/#Comment_435488" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-19T14:31:02+00:00" title="July 19, 2014  2:31PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like a neat idea.

Just curious. When I partake in solo play, it's for gamist satisfaction \u2013 experiencing a mechanical system and seeing if I survive or lose and looking for surprises. That's why I tend to drift toward video games for solo play, because even self-running gamist dungeon games aren't as fun for me. For example, I never enjoyed playing Castle Ravenloft alone.<br/><br/>I partake in roleplaying games like D&amp;D or AW to brush up against imaginary worlds I create with the help of others. I want to express a creative viewpoint and experience how others react or get surprised by their own perspectives and needs. The story side of role playing is intrinsically social for me.<br/><br/>I guess what I'm trying to say is, if I want to experience an interesting story alone, I'd either read one or write one rather than "play" one. Since I can't relate, I'm extremely curious what itch running AW alone would serve for you. Once I know that, maybe I can help with how to make it run solo.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer" title="Dreamer"><img alt="Dreamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer">Dreamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435494/#Comment_435494" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-19T18:02:30+00:00" title="July 19, 2014  6:02PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 19, 2014 6:07PM by Dreamer.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've actually been thinking of this for the last couple of weeks, except I was thinking in terms of Hero's Journey MC moves that would be triggered by some in fiction event.

Lack of time too,which prevents you from making any commitments.

In either case, you roll at +6 less the number of CARDs you have, to see if your House comes crashing downing bringing all the imminent trouble all at once. The twist is at the end of the conference (i.e. the session) if your House is still standing you get the number of CARDs as XP. I do the same thing with theorems (i.e. projects or endeavours) which naturally replace Fronts* with something player-facing. <br/><br/>What this thread reminds me of is that when you design a GMless / MCless game it can be worth checking if it is capable of solo play. I've discovered functional solo play hidden in some of my past designs, perhaps Squaring the Circle has it too.<br/><br/>*It occurs to me that in drawing a hard move it may be worth incorporating the most relevant Fronts into the mix too. A separate deck makes sense to me, as you'll want hard moves to relate to the situation and not necessarily be equally distributed over all the possible Fronts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435518">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CynicalSleuth" title="CynicalSleuth"><img alt="CynicalSleuth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/538/n27XUW2DMWMWH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CynicalSleuth">CynicalSleuth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435518/#Comment_435518" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-20T12:18:18+00:00" title="July 20, 2014 12:18PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">@wyrmwood</a> I actually looked at squaring the circle before you posted as I was looking at hacks for inspiration on further development and I rather like it.

At least that's how it felt when I played a few months of DW.<br/><br/>If you want to run a single hero game with no MC, maybe we could take the player reactions chart idea and make it an MC mood chart. Again, you are in full control of your own character as WELL as acting as the MC upon failed rolls and make MC moves against yourself. However, the fictional severity of moves made against yourself is controlled by a MC attitude that's out of your control.<br/><br/>Here's another rough example using a 2d6 bell curve. Could maybe be adapted to a deck of cards or something else. <br/><br/>MC ATTITUDE<br/>2-6 extreme fictional punishment/complication toward a failure<br/>7-9  standard punishment/bargain<br/>10+ let off easy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435524">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435524/#Comment_435524" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-20T16:26:03+00:00" title="July 20, 2014  4:26PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 20, 2014 4:27PM by AsIf.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I feel those MC Attitudes should be more tightly pegged to the state of the game.  <br/>Or at least modifiers.  "+2 if you're nearly dead through no fault of your own" kinda thing.<br/><br/>Of course, if we're <i>really</i> talking about automating the MC, the model would be much more complex; this still relies on you to make a judgment call.  <br/><br/><i>Addressing the whole topic in a general way:</i> I've done tons of solo play with systems that weren't built for it.  You will <i>always</i> have to make up impromptu rules for yourself and follow your own set of "ethical standards".  One of my favorite techniques is the "binary tree" where you think of two broad classes of answer, roll 50-50 (high or low) to see which one it is, then split that into two more specific answers, again roll 50-50 again, do this as many times as needed til you have your final answer.  <i>Example: Say you've decided that you need to "take away their stuff".  Which item will you take?  Let's see...  Weapons or Resources? (roll=low) Weapons.  The gun or the knife?  (roll=high) The Knife.

Although I do like the idea of having the MC behavior be a move-like thing maybe hooked to the typical "weird" stat or a separate luck trait, and The House of CARDS thing from squaring the circle is probably going to be my basis for threat development. I'll try and type up a document for you all to look over with the stuff I decide to include: mainly a system of MC and player behavior moves, a system for threats based on The House of CARDS system, and maybe that card drawing system for determining moves I started with. We just may design something worth using.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435627/#Comment_435627" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-22T11:48:00+00:00" title="July 22, 2014 11:48AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A simple thing I learned from Eero which is similar to the binary tree, but feels different:<br/><br/>What's the first thing that pops into your head?
