Unsurprisingly the scenery for the adventures is lifted from James Bond movies. My point is, you could simply go through some movies and pull stuff for your own use.<br/><br/>An arbitrary example off the top of my head: in the latest Bond movie 007 makes a quick visit to Shanghai (I think - some Chinese place) and accosts his lead in a gentlemen's club or casino or something, and the place has an atrium with a bridge over an oriental sand garden, and there's an alligator living down below. Obviously Bond ends up fighting his way out, so he gets to fight on this small inside-a-house bridge setpiece, complete with a grizzly fate awaiting underneath for whoever drops down there to join the alligator.<br/><br/>It might work for you to grab some action movies and plain steal their action setpieces, there's a lot of stuff like that to be had. It is unfortunate that not all are so striking, so perhaps one would do best by being a bit choosy about which movies to look at in this regard. Should be doable to build up a list by asking people to list movies with memorable action setpieces. Then you just watch them (or even just read about them), jot down the ideas, and hey presto.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448173">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448173/#Comment_448173" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-22T21:25:42+00:00" title="August 22, 2015  9:25PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like dianamic locations  aspects for fighting, if that's the right term.<br/>They start off small and if not delt with snowball. <br/>E.g the troublesome lava rises and belches bubles of gas, igniting in flumes of yellow and green flame.
