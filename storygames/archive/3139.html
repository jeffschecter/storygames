Specifically, it's a <a href="http://nationalprojector.com/INFOCUS/LP580/lp580.htm" rel="nofollow">InFocus LitePro 580</a>, if that matters.  It is kinda dim, though, so the room it is in will likely need to be otherwise dark for it to be visible.  (Or could I use the dimness to my advantage, like projecting an image on the wall which is invisible with the lights on, but then I turn out the lights at the right moment and reveal the image?)<br/><br/>I immediately started thinking about how I could use this thing in a LARP.  I've been itching to write and run another one shot LARP for a little while, and this could potentially be a really cool prop.  (I work in a college Media Center, so I could feasibly create some video or Powerpoint to project using the thing, depending.)   I'm thinking in terms of LARP right now, because I can't think of obvious uses for a tabletop game (though <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/extras/mapProjection.htm" rel="nofollow">this is an awesome use of an LCD projector for old school dungeon crawls</a>).<br/><br/><br/>At the moment, what occurs to me is to make a dystopian, 1984 game, and have various government oppression images projected onto a wall.  You know, like Big Brother's face, slogans in Doublespeak, images of rebellion being crushed, etc.  <br/><br/>Or something weird and creepy, like <a href="http://www.wunderland.com/WTS/Andy/TVWatchingU.html" rel="nofollow">eyes watching you</a>.  Maybe a game in the vein of Videodrome and other technology paranoia movies (um, eXistenz, Avalon, Blade Runner, The Matrix, etc.).  <br/><br/>I was at one point considering running <a href="http://www.game-chef.com/workshop/comments.php?DiscussionID=351&amp;page=1#Item_53" rel="nofollow">Arturo G's Game Chef Game <i>The Red Death</i></a> as a LARP, and I think one of the rooms could use the projector projecting mood appropriate images.  I can probably set up to have something similar playing on two TVs and one or two computers, give or take.  So maybe several rooms could have images being displayed throughout.  (The additional TVs and such could be used for any game, not just the Red Death.)<br/><br/><br/><br/>So, does anyone have any awesome ideas for how to use an LCD projector to enhance a LARP or tabletop game?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_71683">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Albert%20A" title="Albert A"><img alt="Albert A" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://web.mac.com/albertwa/Ryoanji.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Albert%20A">Albert A</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71683/#Comment_71683" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-24T12:21:10+00:00" title="May 24, 2007 12:21PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you wanted to induce a sense of bizarre unreality, you could also hook up a webcam and get some <a href="http://www.mattbell.com/feedback/feedback.html" rel="nofollow">projector feedback</a> going.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71689/#Comment_71689" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-24T12:38:47+00:00" title="May 24, 2007 12:38PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Albert A</cite>If you wanted to induce a sense of bizarre unreality, you could also hook up a webcam and get some<a href="http://www.mattbell.com/feedback/feedback.html" rel="nofollow">projector feedback</a>going.</blockquote>\nThat's really, really cool.

That is a really cool idea, that I need to figure out how to incorporate into the game.<br/><br/><br/>If the projector has no input, it projects a solid royal blue.  So I think it would be cool to have colors connect to the powers, emotions, abilities, etc. that characters had (a la Arturo game linked to before), and then have the color blue be a "critical failure" state for everyone.  Or maybe just a "pause the game while we work out the technical difficulties" signal, which might be more reasonable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_71806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71806/#Comment_71806" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-25T08:50:52+00:00" title="May 25, 2007  8:50AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: misuba</cite>This would take some hacking, but: the game designer John Cooper had a party trick he did one time where he pointed a video camera at the room the party was in, put the video output on a ten-minute delay, then threw it onto the TV in the very same room.<br/><br/>You could take that in all kinds of story directions, from comedy of manners to Philip K.
