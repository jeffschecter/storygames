The board game in question is also intended to eventually act as a frame for a roleplaying/improv game, and as a campaign system for a combat game.   However, it should also <i>work as an actual boardgame without either of those</i>.<br/><br/>Players taking on the role of dragons who rule an island, as a group.  A turn is a season.  <br/><br/>While you read, I'd like you to look for:  <i><b>What kind of play do you think this would create?</b></i><br/><br/>Here's the turn order:<br/><br/><b>1. Primacy Challenges</b><br/>The draconic laws of the Reach limit all challenges for dominance and position on an island to the first day of the season.  So, on the day that the season changes on a given island, dragons may buck and manuever to take on the roles of Prime, Fisher, Shaper, Quickener, Seeker, Shepherd, and Walker, each of which has it's own advantages (Prime beign the biggest).<br/><i>[Mechanism here]</i><br/><br/><b>2. The Prime Assigns Population And Duties</b><br/>The player of the Prime picks up dice to match the 'population pool', and assigns these to the various dragons (including  themself).  They then state what they want that dragon to do as their duties, within their role - a seeker, who rules any mineral deposits, could be told to mine gold for the communal hoard, or to build stone walls on the hills, etc.  Each dragon also has a set number of dice to start with, depending on how well their dragon matches their current duties.  <br/><br/><b>3. Everyone sets closed action, and closed effort - and reveals the effort.</b><br/>Each player grabs a slip of paper, and notes down a project they're undertaking that is <i>not</i> part of their duties, placing this face-down.  They then (behind their hand) put some of their dice on this slip to indicate how much of their oomph they're putting into it.  Dice (population and effort) that are left off this slip of paper are dice the dragon is using towards the duties of their role.<br/><br/><b>4. Duties are resolved</b><br/>Everyone rolls dice for their actual duties, and resolves the effects on the island.  Stuff is built, resources gathered, and so on.<br/><br/><b>5. Events are resolved.</b><br/>Any die pool that comes up with doubles or triples or four-of-a-kind generates an event.  Some events are just color; some are trade offers, others are combative, and still others are roleplay-ish.  This have simple mechanistic effects, except where the related games are plugged together (in which case, this becomes by far the longest step of the game).<br/><br/><b>6. Closed events are revealed and resolved</b><br/>Everyone rolls dice for their pet projects.  Influence is gained, loyalty swayed, personal (on-communal) resources generated.<br/><br/><b>7. Maintain the people.</b><br/>Food and such are dealt with, and any other 'clean-up' occurs.<br/><br/>..................<br/><br/>The game ends after a set number of turns.<br/><br/>The winner is the player with the best personal resources.<br/>However, if the communal resources are not significant enough, <i>everyone</i> loses.<br/><br/>..................<br/><br/>How does that hit you?  How do you <i>expect</i> you'd play it, and what would you <i>hope</i> to see in that mix?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_231856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Charlie%20Gilb" title="Charlie Gilb"><img alt="Charlie Gilb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fileden.com/files/2009/1/23/2281732/Acadia%20show.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Charlie%20Gilb">Charlie Gilb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231856/#Comment_231856" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-11T14:55:54+00:00" title="September 11, 2009  2:55PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 11, 2009 2:56PM by Charlie Gilb.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My first question, which would frame a lot of my answers:<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this game intended to be competitive?

So, rewarding togetherness is what you'd want?<br/><br/>The Prime's duties are the division of labour.  They can also hold one of the other posts, which are resourcey stuff.<br/><br/>Nah, I'm just saying that to work as a board game, there needs to be some reason to do what you're told.  If there's a cycle of do what you're told --&gt; get influence ---&gt;get to do what you want, then that seems like a functional system.  Otherwise, I'm not seeing how the game works.  <br/><br/>If I'm playing a board game, I'm playing to win.  I'll do as much of my personal project as the game lets me.  If I'm losing, and I can't win, then I work to make everyone lose, unless the game prevents that.<br/><br/>I see the fun potential in this game as being about how much you can wrangle doing what you're told to also work towards doing what you want, either by making deals with the Prime in exchange for influence, or by becoming Prime yourself.  Prime can't win influence by obeying instuctions, but Prime can win influence by telling people to do stuff that they want to do.<br/><br/>But this is me indulging in my habit of designing other peoples' games for them.  Do what you want.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
