Not only did the players had a lot of fun with it, it also help me with the preparations for the next week's game, because it gave good indications of what the player wanted to happen. Because of this I became interested in using this idea in other games, so when I was running Burning Wheel recently, I gave it a try. I did not feel that the PTA way of doing "next time on" would be an exact fit to BW, so I changed it a bit. What I did was after each session (when I remembered it) I asked the players about their characters's beliefs and traits, with questions like: "Is there some of your beliefs you want to get more attention?", "Is there some NPCs related to your character you what to have more screen time?", "Do you feel that the story around your character develops too fast or too slow?", and so on like that. These question often led into more free conversation about the game which gave me a solid foundation to build interesting "bangs" for the next session.<br/><br/>Because I find this technique very useful I would like to hear from other people who have used similar techniques in other games, and what experiences you have with it.<br/><br/> - Anders                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253521">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Levine" title="Daniel Levine"><img alt="Daniel Levine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Levine">Daniel Levine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253521/#Comment_253521" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-28T13:22:11+00:00" title="January 28, 2010  1:22PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm using it in my just-started Starblazer Adventures game.  Keeping with the comic-book framing device, we're prepping for the first non-setup session (and will for all future sessions) with a NEXT ISSUE thread on the board Adam set up for us.  I (the GM) come up with the title, and then each player is responsible for adding a snippet, as if a panel or two of a comic.  So far it's been fun (and very helpful for my prep); I'll have to report back on how it works in play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253561">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ldd23" title="ldd23"><img alt="ldd23" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ldd23">ldd23</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253561/#Comment_253561" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-28T15:36:58+00:00" title="January 28, 2010  3:36PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've used it in an episodic Exalted game and a short Dark Sun-inspired campaign.  Not sure if I used it quite like PTA suggests because I've never read or played PTA.  I had each player describe a bit of a scene at the end of each session and tried to work those images into the next session.  It was a huge help for me planning the next session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
