(weekend without net does wonders for creativity)<br/>\n<br/>\nTL;DR - Has anyone here ever tried running a game where all the characters are blank slates? Ie - they know nothing about the characters?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea in more detail:<br/>\nA pre-history game about the birth of magic. Humanity is struggling to survive in a world of monsters and demons - small city-states with the population huddled behind walls, hoping to escape the terrors of the wilderness. But they are loosing. The world is breaking.<br/>\nOne group of the "gods" decides that humanity must be saved, but cannot intervene directly. They want to give magic to the humans. The Gods try to create some people who can wield magic, but they cant get it right.<br/>\nThe result are the PCs. Beings made of divine fire surrounded by a shell which looks human.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game idea that has been bothering me is this: The PCs are these creatures that can pass for human and they have powers, but they (the characters) dont know what they are, or really that much of what they can do.<br/>\n<br/>\nI started out trying to use the White Wolf "Promethian: The Created" books. Its a relatively good fit, but it really requires that the players know and spend time building the characters before hand. I loved the idea of the pilgrimage to create a human soul. The pinoccio theme of "I want to be a real boy" <br/>\n<br/>\nThen I started looking over "Ghost/Echo", "Lady Blackbird", and "Apocalypse World". From my reading I really want to sit this game somewhere in that design space where the abilities and world is much more fluid and influenced by the players, and the faster character creation.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I really want the characters to be doing is working out how they can gain a soul, and to eventually tie the divine fire (Magic) with the human soul and so save the world.... The game is "about" making choices and more fully defining themselves. I want the players to be choosing as the game goes on what their characters are good/bad at, and deciding what is the way for a created being to gain a soul...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268915/#Comment_268915" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-26T02:07:33+00:00" title="April 26, 2010  2:07AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 26, 2010 2:08AM by James_Mullen.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe something like Cold City or Hot War would fit; its an integral part of both games that characters can gain, lose or change their traits as a result of conflicts. If you start the PCs with no traits, then they will only be able to define themselves through conflict. Given that both games also depend on narrative authority being won as a result of conflicts, this means that every conflict would be a struggle for the players to define their characters the way they want them; losing a conflict gives the GM an opportunity to define them in another way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_268916">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268916/#Comment_268916" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-26T02:17:33+00:00" title="April 26, 2010  2:17AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Search for "I roll for shoes" on this site.

Define good thing and bad thing, roll 2D6, one dice result you give to good, the other to bad.

They could have their own special language before birth, be ready to walk and run and climb and dive when born, and be ripe with unbridled magical powers ... but being emotional "blank", much like other babies.<br/><br/>Would give you a "clean slate", sort of, and lots of oportunities for the characters to bond with parents, older siblings, other family, and the rest of their city. Emotional bonds could do a lot towards deepen the game, and developing personalities through "growing up" could liven up the how's of character-building.<br/><br/>And you might escape the smell of super-hero characters. ;-)<br/><br/>Good luck!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268934">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Queex" title="Queex"><img alt="Queex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Queex">Queex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268934/#Comment_268934" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-26T05:37:24+00:00" title="April 26, 2010  5:37AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 26, 2010 5:37AM by Queex.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Produces own trumpet.</i><br/><a href="http://chthonic.150m.com/rpg/thelastchallenge.htm" rel="nofollow">The Last Challenge</a> seems a very close match to what you're after.<br/><i>Trumpet of shame goes back in its box.</i><br/><br/>One aspect which I think could stand to be formalised is the quest for the soul.<br/><br/>Having some mechanical means of tracking progress towards that goal, or having moments when a player can add something to the 'recipe' for the soul, would tie the game very tightly to that goal.

Often people bring up games that are unavailable and essentially unknowable. And worse, they use them in a way like "X is an obvious example of Y" or "You could try playing X." But you can't find X, read X, or play X. So the advice is for shit. I find this personally frustrating because it enforces a sort of clique. It makes a reader who doesn't know about the game or can't get it feel like an outsider. (Hey, my friends and I play this really cool game. You would like it. Oh, you want a copy? Sorry, you can't have one.)<br/><br/>I know that no one here means to come off that way, but nonetheless that's the way it reads. So, be careful when you proffer Psi-Run, Blood Red Sands, et al as an example of something.

I hear you. I don't want to make a big fight out of it, my comments were probably too aggressive. However, I think being defensive is equally unhelpful. <br/><br/>For the record, I have asked multiple times for a way to buy, beg, or borrow Psi-Run and I haven't gotten a useful response (I rarely get a response.) That includes this forum. A recording of Psi-Run actual play (which I have listened to) isn't a good resource for figuring out what the game is about or how it really works. There is way too much unstated. It's not at all like reading the game. <br/><br/>As for BRS, I apologize. I did a quick search and didn't turn it up. My Google-fu is weak.<br/><br/>This ...\n<blockquote>If there are a group of people who Do have knowledge of something,<br/>and a group of people who Don't know anything about it... <br/>then the latter group doesn't just FEEL left out, <br/>they ARE left out.<br/><br/>It's not a side-effect of popularity-contest social dynamics. <br/>It's a side-effect of actual knowledge distribution.</blockquote>\n.. is just a nasty response. I didn't ask anyone to play stupid. I'm asking people not to give unhelpful advice. If I site a game that is outside of the general knowledge base of gamers and then don't explain it, link to it, or at least know a person can get a copy of it, I am being opaque. If I have to already be knowledgeable about the more rare story games in order to use this site, how will new people find their way here and find out about these games? You can post about Psi-Run all you want. I have certainly enjoyed the AP threads for it here. But don't just throw it out there like it's common knowledge. It perpetuates the closed-ness of the environment. \n<blockquote>f you went to a cineast board you wouldn't be expected to know and have seen all the movies people talk about either.</blockquote>\nYes, but I could go rent the movie from Netflix. There's a difference between citing something that people have easy access to and citing something that people don't. It's the difference between talking about On the Road by Jack Kerouac and the cool gardening diary my grandpa wrote that I made copies of for my friends.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/docholaday" title="docholaday"><img alt="docholaday" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/docholaday">docholaday</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268962/#Comment_268962" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-26T08:59:32+00:00" title="April 26, 2010  8:59AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Best explanation of Psi-Run I have found to date (starts about halfway down the thread). <br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=9341" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=9341</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_268969">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus" title="Dionysus"><img alt="Dionysus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/694/n0ANCVBURZLRD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus">Dionysus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268969/#Comment_268969" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-26T09:42:23+00:00" title="April 26, 2010  9:42AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks troy - that is.. very interesting.

Add dice as per the element you are acting on.<br/>\nRoll- 2d6. 1 dice result assign to the goal, 1 result to the danger.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhenever you roll a 6 for the goal - the task you just achieved becomes one of your milestones, with a rating of 1, and gain 1xp<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery time you then do an act relating to a milestone you roll 2d6. with goal: learning and danger: now irrelevant.<br/>\ngoal 1-2 0xp, 3-4: 1xp 5-6: 2xp<br/>\ndanger: 1-2: rating -1, 3-4: rating unchanged. 5-6 rating +1<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the rating of the milestone goes to 0, you have learnt everything you can from that, and you have to find another milestone.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can only have 1 milestone for each element at one time.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Thats all i have so far)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268971">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus" title="Dionysus"><img alt="Dionysus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/694/n0ANCVBURZLRD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus">Dionysus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268971/#Comment_268971" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-26T09:45:09+00:00" title="April 26, 2010  9:45AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            actually - one thing i forgot - you can you 5xp to put+1 into an element.

I think the nicest thing about your idea is that it mechanically encodes player participation in the fiction and in developing the fictional physics of the setting, much like Brennan Taylor's <a href="http://www.indiepressrevolution.com/xcart/product.php?productid=16842&amp;cat=0&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">Mortal Coil</a>. I like the idea of including Aether in with the four traditional elements. You might want to rethink the word "divine" in the subtitle, unless you really mean it. It seems to bring in religion. Maybe you want that, since you are playing with the idea of a soul as well. And, if I could make a suggestion, you might toy around with using cards instead of dice. I have thought about how a "hand of cards" would affect a system like Otherkind Dice and it seems to me it might smooth over some of the painfulness of that system and make it a bit more character friendly. (To be clear, the system's painfulness and character-chewing dice is actually a feature I LIKE about it, for some settings.) Card suits, though, would give you a feature that could be aligned with the elemental powers. (clubs = earth, spades = air, hearts = water, and diamonds = fire ... or some such).<br/><br/>BTW, <b>my apologies</b> to everyone for bringing the snark with me on a Monday morning.
