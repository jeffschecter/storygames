Like, when it's my turn, you can take my past Achievements, threaten them, and try to get me to spend my resources on those threats rather than the Goal of my turn.  If you succeed in getting me to spend, then you've done well, and you earn a point.  But there's no strategy involved; the point is just a reward for <i>narrative</i> performance.  You did a good job coming up with a cool threat that my character cares about!<br/><br/>What would you want to spend those points on?  What would be worthy?  What would feel like satisfying recognition that you are in fact awesome at providing situation-fodder for other people's characters?<br/><br/>Context: multi-protagonist game, protagonists don't significantly interact, game takes turns alternating between protagonists, each player has one protagonist, main thing protagonists do is pursue, achieve, and sweat about their needs and aspirations.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_356828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356828/#Comment_356828" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-30T19:53:06+00:00" title="January 30, 2012  7:53PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ideas:<br/><br/>Give my character more screen time.<br/><br/>Give me more opportunities or authority to do more of what I'm good at (e.g. threatening people's Achievements).<br/><br/>Give me power to provide the final word on the game once play is done.

As you know from Land of Nodd, you can easily use a currency like this to create more screen time AND better odds of success for your own character. That seems like a good driver (or I wouldn't have built it in, of course).<br/><br/>2. Some special "unlockables", some kind of achievements you could not otherwise have access to.<br/><br/>If it's about your character (as in #1), that could mean giving your character a shot at some future or some achievement that would otherwise be impossible. Maybe your character can only have a chance to drive away the Dragon threatening the kingdom... but if you had 10 GM Points, you could go on a Quest to get the Sword of Dragon-Slaying, and then your character could actually have a chance to kill the Dragon (or become King, or whatever).<br/><br/>If it's more about GMing, then maybe having a certain number of points gives you access to some special aspect of the fiction. For example, if the game is like Dogs in the Vineyard, maybe we each make Town-like situations for each others' characters. But once I earn 10 GM Points, I am suddenly allowed to bring supernatural elements (sorcery, demons) into play when I'm GMing, making my Towns more intense than everyone else's.<br/><br/>So, we all play looking forward to the introduction of whatever this thing that can be "unlocked", whether it's the player or the GM who does so.<br/><br/>(Heck, maybe it's even a competition, where the first GM to get 10 GM Points can now try to kill the other players' characters! So we play, and I hope I can earn enough GM points so I can kill off your character before you can get the same 10 Points and try to kill mine in my story.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357011/#Comment_357011" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-31T12:38:31+00:00" title="January 31, 2012 12:38PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David, I think you're getting some good stuff from a lot of people here, but it's along different channels.  Not to over-complicate things, but you may want to provide different trees of options here.<br/><br/>People are motivated to provide good opposition, or really colorful attention getting descriptors, for different reasons.  Categorize those GM personas into trees, and let them gather up points for their own special moves.<br/><br/>For instance, some people GM because they like stitching other people together and fading in to the background.  Allowing them to override someone else's decision might be the best benefit there, because they can "see something others can't" and they want to push things in a fruitful direction.<br/><br/>Some of them just love grinding other people hard and forcing them into tough situations.  Allowing them to rewind a few sentences and re-spin what someone else described, or tack on additional constraints, might be their best benefit.<br/><br/>Some of them like making things into comptetition, so allowing them to nuke another player's character (or their holdings) seems like a great reward.<br/><br/>It shouldn't be too specific, and certainly some cross-overs in powers will occur.  You could even allow people to buy stuff from someone else's list for an additional cost.  But if Jake is over there being dark and brooding and mysterious, and I reward him for doing that, it's probably a good sign that I want him to continue being dark and brooding and mysterious while he spends those points, and not random and violent.<br/><br/>I may be overthinking this, but thems my two cents.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_357112">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357112/#Comment_357112" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-31T23:54:35+00:00" title="January 31, 2012 11:54PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 31, 2012 11:56PM by David_Berg.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool stuff!

I'm certainly not ruling the idea out!  I'm just more excited by other rewards right now.<br/><br/>I definitely like the ideas about increasing <i>what a GM can do</i> with the time they have.  Which I guess relies on a starting point where there are certain things you <i>can't</i> do.  As Paul said, "unlockables".  I'm seeing two major types thus far:<br/><br/><b>1. Unlockable Fictional Content</b><br/><br/>Zachary, I like your examples!<br/>- more power to present challenges<br/>- more power to define and control setting<br/>- more power to define and control NPCs<br/>- more power to frame your scene<br/><br/>These are things I'm used to GMs controlling from the get-go, but in a multi-GM game, I supposed certain things could start as off-limits.  The key would be to define those things in such a way that a GM's creativity isn't hamstrung without them.  Maybe they should be very specific, but also very high-impact?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>For example, if the game is like Dogs in the Vineyard, maybe we each make Town-like situations for each others' characters.

Brainstorming some more:<br/>- killing important NPCs<br/>- establishing global conditions like national power balance, level of magic, presence of super-science<br/>- setting a scene on a protagonist's "home turf" where all their valuables and family are at risk<br/><br/><b>2. Unlockable Fiction-Establishing Techniques</b><br/><br/>Most of Arnold's (Harlequin) ideas fall under this category.  These are adjustments to the <i>process</i> of establishing what happens.  <br/><br/>Ideas:<br/>- insert off-screen content when it's not your turn to GM<br/>- say no to proposed or narrated occurrences and NPC actions<br/>- briefly control someone else's protagonist for a specific purpose<br/>- author other protagonists' dreams and memories<br/>- delay resolution to add or change fictional stakes                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357298">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357298/#Comment_357298" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-02T05:22:00+00:00" title="February  2, 2012  5:22AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm interested.

Like, maybe the game premise includes some mystery that took place *before* play begins. When you get 10 GM Points, you're allowed to answer some mystery from the past, or frame a scene that forces someone else to reveal something about this mystery you're all wondering about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357714">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357714/#Comment_357714" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-04T00:36:08+00:00" title="February  4, 2012 12:36AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 4, 2012 12:36AM by David_Berg.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Arnold, sure!

Basically, letting the GM mess with anything that's outside the game's currency system.  For example, a GM can't steal a player's armor or stats or life points or relationship dice, but they could turn any of them <i>ugly</i>.  Or the reverse; make them <i>magnificent</i>.  So the fun of earning GM points might be so you could do such things... or just so you could <i>threaten</i> to do such things, and achieve some sort of desired leverage.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357817">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357817/#Comment_357817" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-04T19:43:23+00:00" title="February  4, 2012  7:43PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wait...<br/><br/>How does game play look if you CANNOT do those things?
