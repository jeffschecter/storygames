Caves.  Dragons,  Swords.  <br/>Sure, you could argue that it'd be tough to find symbols that can't be sexualized, but D&amp;D's got a bunch.  <br/>Freud would be proud.                          </div>

                            There is no need to resort to sexual <i>symbolism</i> to explain why D&amp;D is popular among boys and men. Exploring the unknown, fighting enemies and stealing their treasure are all activities that directly increase sexual competitiveness. Of course, D&amp;D is a game and probably reduce mating chances by channelling those energies into ersatz activity.                        </div>

                            DnD is popular because colonialism is so deeply entrenched in our society and a lot of our more common methods of telling stories that it feels natural to many people. It's not hard to imagine why people in the imperial core who materially benefit daily from colonialism would want to play a game about imaginary colonialism.                        </div>

                            Are you talking about specifically D&amp;D, or the entire genre of traditional medieval-fantasy RPGs?<br/><br/>My answer to your question is simply that it’s the established brand with the name recognition and marketing budget. It’s certainly nothing to do with sexiness (there are a hundred other games with boob-armored babes, and WotC has actually done a commendable job lately making their art less exploitative.)<br/><br/>Calling out “colonialism” reminds me of that aftereffect of first encountering Edward Said in college when everything seemed amenable to a convenient postmodern deconstruction. Decades later I’m not buying it. Contrariwise, the truest cultural-studies attack on the genre is that it’s too close to its northern-European roots — a lazy elf-dwarfy appropriation of Nordic / English / Slavic tropes without an appreciation of the breadth of world cultures.                        </div>

They don't have name recognition. They rarely have marketing budget. In this society, that means they won't have perceived legitimacy either, except insofar as they can be convincingly described as "like D&amp;D". Not fair? Annoying? Ridiculous? So shallow? Sure, but still true. See also: people still eat truckloads of Hershey's "chocolate".                        </div>

Because it's American Dream: the Game. Go forth and tame the vast wilderness, conquer the lands, become wealthy beyond your imaginings by the workings of your own hands. It's the frontier spirit that is the core of Americana, imagined within a game about medieval fantasy wargaming. It hits a lot of checkboxes for men:<br/><br/>[ ] Fightin'<br/>[ ] Explorin'<br/>[ ] Conquistadorin'<br/><br/>Add in knights, wizards, and dragons to your taste.                        </div>

                            People Who Think It's Just Coca-Cola, Um So That's Why,<br/><br/>The brand is compelling because of something beyond marketing.  Don't you think it's rather shallow, just to view it's success solely on marketing?  <br/><br/>And I don't think it's colonialism is much of a selling point anymore.  I imagine, even if it weren't about "enlightening", cataloging, exploring, a small part of an old, savage world, it'd still be popular.  <br/>But maybe not?  <br/><br/>It connects with the subconscious.   <br/><br/>For the record, I started off playing rpgs with the yellow box, of Marvel Super Heroes. <br/>I never really *got* D&amp;D until much later.                        </div>

It's a shitty game, as far as games go.  I mean, Monopoly is a better game, and I fucking hate Monopoly.  <br/><br/>It's a great sort of game.  The best parts of D&amp;D aren't covered by rules.  Arguing over party order, now that's fun.                          </div>

                            Not much of a discussion here then, if we don't want to look into the details of how exactly D&amp;D sells on sex.<br/><br/>Are you doing fine, Nathan? Your recent threads have seemed pretty confused to me, sort of like free association stream of thought in places. Or like you were having the same discussions in several different places, and that's why we see these shards of unfinished thought floating about. You've started threads pretty spontaneously as long as I remember (which is often a nice habit - I'm the opposite myself and thus rarely start discussions), often on some relatively whimsical thought, but here it's not even that. You just put out a provocative "hot take" and sit down to see who cares enough to get into a twist over it, and then act as if others are being smarmy by asking you to elaborate.<br/><br/>You know best whether to talk about it, of course, but it's difficult to not notice that this thread has much more "pay attention me" than "here's an interesting thought" to it. I fear you're being harsh to others, too: if I was Shimrod I'd be outright offended by your insinuation that he's asking anything but a straight question based on what you asserted.                        </div>

                            I guess I'll take a shot at the actual topic, too. Here's my thoughts:<br/><br/>First, I agree with Emma on the broad thematic analysis: the original and in some ways primary themes that D&amp;D relies on are less sexual and more "colonial". Here's what I see as front-and-center in the game in its early years:<br/><b>*</b> Cerebral wargaming - figuring out how things work<br/><b>*</b> Messing around with fantasy iconography<br/><b><b>*</b> Leaving civilization to adventure in dangerous places</b><br/><b><b>*</b> Encountering savages and conquering them</b><br/><b><b>*</b> Being cleverer and more context-independent than the monsters and NPCs</b><br/><b>*</b> Going into dark holes of horror<br/><b>*</b> Being a fantasy hero<br/><br/>So there's a bunch of things going on there, not all of them simultaneously relevant, not all of them outright literary qualities. I bolded the themes that particularly and specifically mirror imperial, colonialist worldview and fiction. Make of that what you will - to me it's a convincing argument that these ideas are pretty central to D&amp;D's past appeal. My best guess for why this isn't often acknowledged is that it's not something gamers like to think about, so it's more comfortable to pretend that it doesn't exist.<br/><br/>However, the above's something we've hashed out a lot in the past. Let's look at this new idea, sexualization! I think there's a kernel of truth there, too. Consider the following ideas:<br/><br/><b>Originally D&amp;D represents sexuality in a very patriarchalist way:</b> The neutral adventurer state-to-be is to be a male; from early on a female adventurer is treated as an object of sexuality in the play culture, enough so for the phenomenon to be universally acknowledged; specifically female monsters more often than not use sexual or sex-symbolic wiles as their primary interaction; female NPCs generally exist to be saved in a traditional knight-saves-princess way; prostitution is normalized as an adventure lifestyle assumption; the one thing that connects all these sexual opportunities of the D&amp;D adventurer (female co-adventurers, female monsters, female NPCs, prostitutes) is that he needs to delve into the dark places of the earth to seize his sexual privilege. No dungeon, no pussy. (You need the gold to buy the prostitute, in case that one wasn't clear.) The implicit world-view is that the player characters are young male gorillas, thrown out by their home pack as they come of age, and now they are forced to wander around in search of sexual opportunity until they luck out. It is a tale as old as time.<br/><br/>Now, I'm the first to admit that the above phenomenon is not somehow <i>central</i> to the game. It's there if you look for it, but it's easy to end up playing the game in an entirely non-sexual way, too. I've had campaigns swing back and forth. If I had to characterize the earliest D&amp;D in this regard, I think that it was potentially and often in practice rather refined, gentlemanly in the sense that the players would never <i>dare</i> to go beyond well-established romantized depiction of sexuality in how they narrate their game. This is still the default depiction e.g. in my own campaigns; I make sure to mention that the princesses are pretty and happy to be rescued, but that's as far as it goes in terms of graphic depiction - sex is not even implied, it merely exists as a distant thematic possibility. The knight is fulfilled by saving the princess for underlying sexually thematic reasons, yes, but actual sex never needs to come up in any way; the underlying meaning of "knight saves princess" is clear enough without having to play through the most monkey-like form of the story. Like a family movie, basically. Still enough to notice and enjoy if the theme resonates for you.<br/><br/>That being said:<br/><br/><b>I think that there's a second, somewhat different sexual theme also in D&amp;D, that of identity fulfillment.</b> I personally think that this was a very weak theme, possibly non-existing (if you can actually say something like that in thematic analysis) in the earliest D&amp;D, but it grew in importance over time until today it's much stronger than the patriarchalist idea of achieving sexual opportunity by being a knight-errant.<br/><br/>Identify fulfillment sexualization is the thematic idea that the player character him- or herself can be a sexually attractive being who is validated as a hero and a protagonist by their comeliness. The game focuses on immersing into the identity of a socially valid person, a hero who may be more accomplished than the player himself. Because sexuality is such a big part of social validity, it's not enough for such a hero to be e.g. older than the young person playing the character, or richer; they have to also be more comely, confident and successful in love, even if the latter bit is often left implicit by the culture of play.<br/><br/>You can trace the development of this idea by looking at what adventurers look like in D&amp;D game books, basically. It is more common to see adventurers look like traumatized murderhobos in older books, while newer ones pay ever-increasing attention (literally, the trend has only been up from the beginning) to depicting adventurers as impossibly ideal personas.<br/><br/>I suppose one could argue that this isn't an inherently sexual appeal, but I have to confess that I don't really understand why the ideal adventurer would be young, athletic, comely on various varieties, completely unscarred, and with such tight comic book buns, if it wasn't for the sake of the sexual fantasy.<br/><br/>So yeah, that's as far as I get in arguing that D&amp;D is "about" sexuality. I think that with those themes it's still <i>less</i> about sexuality than your average American superhero comic book, but I think it's fair to say that it uses sex to sell itself nowadays, a bit at least. Both of the above ideas are, to me, somewhat credible as sources of sales impulse: teenage boys respond to the chivalric-patriarchal ideations about saving princesses, and even wider demographics see the appeal in looking at pictures of pretty people and pretending to be pretty people themselves.                        </div>

                            In a couple of other recent D&amp;D threads, we came to the conclusion that modern D&amp;D is, in its basic form, superhero fiction.<br/><br/>Older D&amp;D didnt seem that way to me (in particular, you might thing about how low level characters are notorious scavengers, and high level characters are expected to build a keep and end out their armies from there -neither very superhero-like).<br/><br/>Modern D&amp;D characters are powerful, colourful... at once unique and visually distinctive but also fitting in a very specific mold. <br/><br/>It seems to me that there is a very similar power fantasy thing, where the heroes should also be young and virile and beautiful, with exaggerated sexual characteristics - either really masculine or really feminine. That's also superhero-like, in my eyes.                        </div>

I've been following a discussion about the various 2E Complete _____ race books on RPG.net and it's been really overwhelmingly negative about their treatment of pretty much everything. While I will accept that there is a legitimate grievance about the over-generalization of sentient species and the way it plays in light of real-world racism, there's also a really strong undercurrent of people wanting every playable race to be nothing more than humans but with different power sets.<br/><br/>A lot of complaints about how 4E/5E "did it better" by creating race backgrounds that allow them to slide easily into the traditional D&amp;D Adventurer Role, rather than the more restrictive social circumstances that older books often presented. I can't help but feel that the "Super Hero D&amp;D" attitude is lurking strong behind that kind of reasoning.<br/><br/>I also read something fascinating a little while back about the socioloigical sex and gender implications of sword and sorcery fiction (I believe it was a bit more complex than just "power fantasy" but my memories of the details is fuzzy at best) that I feel like would be really germane to this conversation, but for the life of me I can't remember where I found it and trying to dig it up has gotten me nowhere <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/> </div>

                            My argument as an old-timer is that a lot of this comes out of the pulps, nearly a hundred years ago now. <br/><br/>One of the big influences on old school D&amp;D was Fritz Leiber's Lankhmar stories, which were published starting in the 30's, I think, and were heavy influenced in their own turn by a story by Cervantes about a Thieves' Guild, "Rinconete y Cortadillo", and were published in the pulps.  <br/><br/>Conan was another big influence, and Robert E. Howard was a complicated guy with a complicated and pretty awful outlook on race and class (by today's standards, and maybe even his own era's).  <br/><br/>And HP Lovecraft is his own special subject.  <br/><br/>So it's hard IMO to sort out the cultural, racial, sexual, etc. politics of D&amp;D without getting into some pretty heavy literary and cultural history.  <br/><br/> </div>

Meanwhile, the Chainmail Fantasy Supplement (which, yes, is not D&amp;D, I know) had units explicitly called Heroes and Super-Heroes, and I don't think it's hard to draw a line connecting them to the semi-exceptional status of PCs.<br/><br/>I'd argue the Super Hero DNA has always been there, its simply that its expression has become more overt in recent generations. I know that <a href="http://www.enworld.org/forum/content.php?3626-Doctor-Strange-The-Original-D-D-Grognard" rel="nofollow">people have spotted what they believe to be the influence of Dr. Strange</a> specifically in some early bits of D&amp;D, for example.                        </div>

<br/>I actually agree that I don't find the colonialist themes to be dominant in D&amp;D to quite the same extent as some other people do (I would never say that "D&amp;D is fundamentally and entirely a colonialist narrative", for instance). <br/><br/>However, this is interesting:

Isn't the Western genre precisely about colonialism? It's literary the story of colonizing a wild land (and taking wealth from its inhabitants - the basic premise of dungeoneering).                        </div>

                            That sounds more like a terminology issue than a disagreement, Hamnacb. It's good to remember that although we use the same words in the same language, we all have quite different experiences and reading background, which means that we associate different things with different words. The connotations are different.<br/><br/>For instance, when people say that D&amp;D reminds them of "colonialism" or "imperialism", what do they actually mean? Do they mean that D&amp;D adventurers are like Christopher Columbus? Do they mean that D&amp;D dungeons are like the Congo Free State? Indian colonialism (advanced people suborning another advanced people) or Australian colonialism (advanced people vs. neolithic people)? Naval colonialism or the continentally contiguous sort engaged by the Russian empire and the United States?<br/><br/>I can't speak for others, but when I say that D&amp;D resembles a 19th century colonialist narrative, <i>fantasy western is precisely what I mean!</i> The American wild west of the 19th century is exactly the kind of colonial milieu that D&amp;D evokes.<br/><br/>Whether the American west is a "colonial" milieu is, of course, up for discussion. I'm mildly surprised if somebody thinks that it's somehow different from what all the other advanced civilizations were doing at the time, but as I just started my post by reminding us about the frailty of words, I'm in no position to just assume that everybody agrees to something that my background makes obvious to me.<br/><br/>Either way, it's probably better to speak of substance than terminology. Therefore: when I say that D&amp;D draws from imperialistic cultural underpinnings, what I concretely mean is that its creators were neck-deep into modern era adventure literature, which their creation unsurprisingly then emulates and models. D&amp;D adventurers are white men in exotic places, acting on nothing but their own justice. I personally think that the sheer honesty of the greed in the early game is its greatest virtue: whatever the ancillary reasons for a quest hook existing, it is impossible to dress up the fact that the player characters themselves are in the dungeon out of greed. "Us" are "out there" doing "adventure", which is what the imperial era cultural recipe for storytelling mandates, but at least D&amp;D is cynically honest about it (when not doing race theories about the inherent evil of the greenskins, at least). I won't claim that the later developments are only to the worse, but to my senses the cover justifications have grown denser and more romanticized over the decades: many would actually claim that the modern D&amp;D adventurer is no simple murderhobo anymore, that he actually has justification for the monster genocide outside its convenience for the human habitation.                        </div>

                            I'd argue that fantasy as a genre is completely about colonialism. I'm talking colonialism as an ideology, colonialism as a power structure, which goes hand in hand with imperialism and fascism.<br/>Fantasy as a genre is built around the concept of an objective world where personal power is meaningful above all else, where the divine right of kings is often very literal, where some races are "subhuman" and thus it's cool to subjugate and murder them, where a meaningful and societally essential career path is going into ruins and murdering the "subhuman" people there to "reclaim" artifacts of religious and cultural significance, etc. <br/>Most fantasy also is very much built around the way medieval Europe was imagined by literal white supremacists (read: no POC anywhere other than slaves, men are in charge because of some pseudo-biology bullshit, you could get away with killing people you didn't like, etc.). <br/>There's a lot of innate biological essentialism to the genre as well. Stuff like "elves are naturally smarter", "orcs are naturally stronger and dumber", "dwarves are naturally wiser", "drow are innately evil", etc. There's also a lot of essentialist notions about women, with stuff like "women are weaker than men" being a really common take in the genre.<br/>This sort of stuff is pretty inextricably linked to the genre. At its very best, fantasy is hideously tone-deaf and inappropriate. At its worst (which it's often at it's worst), it's literal fascist propaganda.<br/>*steps down off of her angry soapbox, probably*                        </div>

                            That’s really overly broad. Sure, a lot of old fantasy is colonialist, but there are recent authors who’ve been writing deliberately anti-colonialist fantasy.

                            One Hundred Years of Solitude isn't fantasy. It's magic realism, which is kind of the opposite of fantasy, despite some aesthetic similarities.                        </div>

                            But the mainstream trend is clear, though, isn't it? The fact that 20% of fantasy literature is deconstructionist about it doesn't change the fact that the rest is either deeply conservative or ignorantly repeating the party line.<br/><br/>I'll say that I am tremendously enthusiastic about the fantasy genre myself, but I would never attempt to whitewash it just for that. Robert E. Howard was the libertarian equivalent of a fascist (paleo-militant, I dunno quite what to call it - what's Hans-Hermann Hoppe's ideology called?), J.R.R. Tolkien was a Christian patriarchalist, Gary Gygax was outright fascist if I understand correctly, and the herds riding on their coat-tails are mostly apolitical hacks who perpetuate themes they barely understand or care about. If my enjoyment of the literature was predicated on agreeing with the authors' worldviews, I doubt I'd get far with fantasy literature. For every exception writing consciously different fantasy there's another ten J.K. Rowlings ready to regurgitate the "destined son of the superior race saves the world with violent means" stuff.<br/><br/>In comparison, the authors who aren't quite so dashingly colonialist (if that's the umbrella term we're using here) are also remarkably less influential on the genre in general. Funny how that's worked out. My own understanding is that this is due to the underlying thematic bias: the genre works very well for passing on conservative wisdom of various sorts, and therefore people involved with it tend to be ones who find the themes it carries meaningful and exciting.<br/><br/>All recognition to the exceptions, by the way. The surface glaze of the genre as it stands in pop culture is a barren wasteland of post-Tolkien bubblegum fascism, which anybody can ascertain by taking a look at say the five or ten most popular fantasy video games or tv shows of the decade. This takes nothing away from the fact that the likes of e.g. Ursula LeGuin and Samuel R. Delany have also written in the fantasy genre. Their existence might not whitewash the rest, but they do prove that just like you <i>can</i> do western without demonizing Indians, you can do fantasy without implied race war.                        </div>

                            Personally, I'd argue that a lot of the supposed "deconstructionist fantasy" isn't fantasy at all, but is instead a different genre that has some aesthetic similarities to fantasy. Like I'd personally categorize most of LeGuin's work as Speculative Fiction instead of Fantasy. Or like the previous example of One Hundred Years of Solitude being Magic Realism instead of Fantasy.<br/>The colonialist, imperialist, fascist stuff is the core of the fantasy genre. If you remove those elements, I'd argue you're not writing fantasy. You're writing another genre that has some aesthetic similarities, but a completely different purpose and method of going about it. Like for instance to provide an example from Magic Realism, in MR, fantastical elements exist as metaphors for emotional and political realities of our world, whereas in fantasy, fantastical elements exist to create a discrete world. In MR, a character might be a living doll because it's a metaphor for her depression and disassociation, for her lack of a personal identity. In fantasy, a character is a living doll because some wizard made a construct in the shape of a doll and brought it to life, and there's probably a bunch of lore about how it works. There's a major distinction between fantasy and MR also in terms of lore and worldbuilding. Fantasy is very centered around creating objective worlds, whereas MR doesn't create a world at all, and instead uses its story and characters to discuss our world and our lives.                         </div>

Please do argue. Why would you want to define away all non-colonialist writing as "nope, that's not fantasy, that's some other thing, let's figure out what"?

Because colonialism is so deeply a part of fantasy's identity as a genre. "Fantasy without colonialism" is like saying "sci-fi without advanced technology" or "horror without frightening elements" or "magic realism without metaphor". It's an innate contradiction.                         </div>

                            I think I understand what Emma means, but I ultimately don't buy it. The key problem for that analysis as I see it is this: LeGuin's <i>Earthsea</i> (which I think is a good example) is both clearly in the fantasy genre while also being thematically existentialist rather than colonialist. If the genre was inextricably tied with the colonialist themes this would be an impossible combination - either LeGuin would fail to extricate the genre, or I would read the novel and decide that yeah no, this isn't fantasy literature anymore. As this doesn't happen, I'm forced to conclude that the genre can survive non-conservative handling.<br/><br/>Earthsea is, of course, not the only example, but I think that one example suffices when discussing the technical <i>impossibility</i> of writing fantasy without colonialist theming. It would be interesting to hear about it if somebody thinks that Earthsea isn't fantasy, or that it is fascist - either would be a surprising conclusion from the novels to me.

I hesitate to, but it's entirely due to the language game aspect of it. There's a lot of people out there for whom Gygax's political affiliation has some value in itself, so it's just asking for trouble if you insist on giving him some specific party affiliation that somebody else might be unhappy about. A great way to get into the middle of the culture war, in other words. The idea of having to "prove" what "fascism" "means" and applying that to some specific person's thinking for the satisfaction of angry Internet-denizens doesn't sound very appealing. Better if you just take my remark as whimsical rhetorical flourish than some serious claim that the fans will have to disprove or die trying.<br/><br/>(The relationship America has to fascism as a word doesn't make this any easier. As you all probably know, there is no fascism in America, nor can there ever be  -there are only patriotic Americans.)<br/><br/>I'm also no expert on this. GG was a very private person, he published surprisingly little philosophical or political material, and while I've read my share of his game texts, I do not think that personal politics are very strongly presented in those. I've formed my impression from incidental bits and pieces of his thinking that have come up over my years of D&amp;D play and study.<br/><br/>That being said, I welcome everybody to decide from themselves what fascist worldview and cultural politics even mean, and whether Gygax counts as such, or if it's some other word you'd rather use to describe his thoughts. I myself found <a href="http://hackslashmaster.blogspot.com/2013/06/on-alignment-by-gygax.html" rel="nofollow">this bit of Q&amp;A from Dragonsfoot in 2005</a> to be pretty illuminating on the subject, among other tidbits over the years.                        </div>

And wondered if we were going to try to call Earthsea "speculative fiction". Certainly LeGuin herself categorized it as fantasy publicly.                        </div>

                             EmmatheExcrucian's definition is close to mine.<br/>In Fantasy, you throw an idea because it's cool. You feel the power of the hero. What's important is his individual experience (and victory). <br/>In Speculative fiction, you introduce a change in the world and eventually you reflect on our world through this thought experiment. <br/><br/>In this definition the colour (spacecrafts, orcs, vampires, whatever) is anecdotal. <br/><br/>Of course, if you define Fantasy by the colour, you get another result. This latter definition can be useful for understanding the reception (and marketing). But it's not as useful for the analysis of the narrative.                        </div>

                            That's an interesting definition. You're not defining a genre in the sense of cultural history so much as you're looking at the literary techniques pre-eminent in a certain kind of writing. I'm very on board with that sort of thing, I just wouldn't call it "genre" - that word has such great utility as a term for grouping historical trends in writing.<br/><br/>For comparison, the way you'd usually define the "fantasy genre" would be to pinpoint some keystone works that you think are essential and influential examples; perhaps ones that have caused the genre to come into existence historically by being the model on which later authors have modeled their work. This type of historical definition requires one to opinionate on what the noteworthy features of the keystone works are that define the genre, but it doesn't require an opinion on what makes works in the genre appealing to the audiences - it suffices to prove that common features exist and are replicated over time by other authors.<br/><br/>In this sense the "fantasy genre" that fandom recognizes is pretty clearly anything originating in either the pulps or Tolkien (with some minor exceptions, of course). The origins are relatively narrow in that regard. The pulp connection can be traced further back to more general adventure stories, of course, and the Tolkienist strain has its own antecedents in the historical romance and national romanticism of the 19th century.<br/><br/>A good example of how differently people can understand even seemingly common terminology. The fantasy literature as a historical genre obviously includes a lot of stuff that is not about heroic experience - lyrical mindscapes of Lovecraft, humble moralities of Lewis and Tolkien, etc. - but if that wish-fulfillment aspect is what one's paying attention to, then what belongs into the box and what doesn't will seem entirely different.<br/><br/>(If anybody's wondering why I'm constantly name-dropping the same few authors, by the way, it's because I'm trying to guess at something that others as well might have read. I probably have a skewed understanding of what's popularly read in the US and what's not, though. If anybody wants to recommend literary examples of fantasy that are more familiar, feel free.)<br/><br/>Aside from the terminological issue and the notion that "genre" can be very useful in understanding culture history, I do like the stylistic or technical distinction between heroic entertainment and speculative fiction. A very useful thing to have for all sorts of purposes.<br/><br/>The natural follow-up question, then: which is D&amp;D? Is it heroic entertainment or speculative fiction? I would argue that it's clearly been both to different people at different times, and thus has the potential for both.                        </div>

                            Literary techniques is how I define pretty much all genres, tbh. I've never found color-based definitions of genres very useful, personally, especially since almost all of my favorite works of media exist in a space where color-based definitions fail. <br/><br/>I would say that some people use DnD for speculative fiction, but that that's inherently going to give you ludonarrative dissonance because DnD is structurally and mechanically a fantasy game. It's mechanics are all about the advancement of a character's personal power and the obstacles that stand in their way on that path. <br/>Strip away all the aesthetic and color, and DnD would still structurally be a fantasy game, at least by the definition of fantasy that I'm working with.                         </div>

                            On the one hand, there is a thing sometimes called “genre fantasy,” which includes <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> and excludes <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude</i>. <br/><br/>On the other, Borges was a major influence upon the magical realists, and Gygax obviously mined Borges’s <i>Book of Imaginary Beings</i> for ideas when writing the <i>Monster Manual</i>. (The peryton is a dead giveaway.) Wouldn’t surprise me if Gygax had read other Borges as well. 
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" rel="nofollow">EmmatheExcrucian</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>In MR, a character might be a living doll because it's a metaphor for her depression and disassociation, for her lack of a personal identity. In fantasy, a character is a living doll because some wizard made a construct in the shape of a doll and brought it to life, and there's probably a bunch of lore about how it works. There's a major distinction between fantasy and MR also in terms of lore and worldbuilding. Fantasy is very centered around creating objective worlds, whereas MR doesn't create a world at all, and instead uses its story and characters to discuss our world and our lives. </p></div></blockquote>
A problem with this distinction: The Harry Potter books. Not set in a subcreative world, full of metaphorical treatments of our world (including metaphors for the author’s own depression!), but clearly closer to genre fantasy than magical realism. <br/><br/>Another is China Miéville’s Bas-Lag books. Clearly genre fantasy, so derivative from the tabletop RPG experience that there’s a line in <i>Perdido Street Station</i> about adventurers being “unscrupulous graverobbers” who do “anything for gold and experience.” But the books are consciously anti-colonialist, and popular enough to have spawned a small sub-genre (the “New Weird”).                         </div>

                            Harry Potter gives you lore for even it's metaphorical elements though, and it generally doesn't feel like the metaphors were consciously produced at the start. A lot of Harry Potter's supposed metaphorical content feels like stuff people thought was there and then JKR added in stuff pointing towards that interpretation in later books because she liked that reading. <br/>I should also note, I don't have a whole lot to say on Harry Potter because I generally feel like JKR is a horrible person and her books shouldn't be in print. <br/>They're definitely not magical realism, especially given how much of the metaphors in the series are metaphors for views espoused by fantasy in the first place. The woman is a fucking fascist, for instance.<br/><br/>I'm not terribly familiar with the "New Weird", but I'd say that if it's consciously anti-colonialist, it's definitely not fantasy. It sounds like it's own genre that's derived from various sources, among them fantasy. You can draw from fantasy as inspiration without being fantasy.                        </div>

                            A fascinating discussion of terminology, with insights (to me anyway) about Gygax to boot.<br/><br/>I haven't got much to add, except that while I recognize the Western as colonialist, the associations that first come to my mind for the latter are Spanish conquistadores and the British in Africa and India (which is but a tiny slice of colonialism, of course).                        </div>

                            Yeah, that's a very small fraction of everything that is colonialism, but I can definitely understand that imagery being evoked, especially if you're not familiar with the term in the context of stuff like Marxism-Leninism and other similar spaces politically-speaking.<br/>(There's also the fact that the imperialist establishment very very much wants people to think colonialism is a thing of the past, because if they admit that colonialism is an ongoing struggle that won't stop until capitalism is done away with, they have to admit 1) that capitalism is broken, and 2) that they're not only complicit but pretty completely responsible for the problem).                        </div>

                            I was wondering about Harry Potter and China Mieville's books a day I was reading this thread, too. I'm not the world's biggest Harry Potter fan, but it seems strange to me to discount those books as fantasy (not only are they clearly fantastical and draw on fantasy tropes, but they also feature typical fantasy story stuff like archetypes of mentors and the Prophesied One, etc).<br/><br/>China Mieville's books use lots of fantasy conventions and tropes, too, but they have very familiar colonialist themes, in the traditional fantasy sense being discussed here. It's just that they take the side of the oppressed more often than the colonizers.<br/><br/>What do people feel about those two works? <br/><br/>And how about these?<br/><br/>* Star Wars<br/>* The Neverending Story<br/>* The Last Unicorn<br/>* The Princess Bride<br/>* James Cameron's Avatar<br/>* His Dark Materials<br/>* The Wheel of Time <br/>* A Song of Ice and Fire                         </div>

For me it's not a contradiction for a "fantasy" work to be thematically deconstructive or outright perpendicular to what's usual for the genre. That's just not how genre works: you don't say that e.g. <i>Watchmen</i> is "not a superhero story" because it questions what works in the genre usually take for granted. You just say that it is a deconstructionist work, one that questions the implicit premises of the genre. The same goes for later western movies that depicted the wild west as a grim and cruel place where injustice and racism abounds; that doesn't make the work a non-western when it still chooses to be a story about cowboys and gunfights.<br/><br/>It might be helpful to remember that "fantasy" is generally taken both in fandom and in academic study as a conceptually broad "super-genre" in itself, with many subgenres, some of which have already died out and some of which do not necessarily talk to each other anymore. The ones most prominent in gaming culture are pulp fantasy (sword &amp; sorcery - Conan, Elric, Lankhmar, early D&amp;D), epic fantasy (Tolkien), gaming fantasy (later D&amp;D, all the copycats), and horror fantasy (WoD-style aesthetized supernatural horror). On top of that we have a bunch of fantasy genres that have died out as ongoing concerns or just aren't very popular in gaming, such as fairy tales, urban fantasy, steampunk and no doubt many that I can't be bothered to dredge up right now.<br/><br/>The traditional fandom definition of the fantasy genre is basically that it's entertainment literature (as opposed to fine literature or classics) with supernatural elements that isn't horror. This definition can be rather myopic when you get into the borders with other speculative fiction genres like science fiction (or other genres in general, really), because there's no particular reason why you couldn't mix tropes from both, but it's served the scene well enough for almost a century by now. If it's got a wizard in it then it's at least somewhat "fantasy".<br/><br/>Which is incidentally why it's fair to call <i>Star Wars</i> "space fantasy" in addition to calling it "soft scifi" or "space opera" (which of course doesn't tell us whether it's fantasy or scifi) - it's got a lot of fantasy genre tropes and structure in it alongside the scifi stuff, wizards included. A good example of a genre-mixing work, really.<br/><br/>I guess that I'd be willing to treat everything on your list as "fantasy", with the understanding that the scifi stuff is mixed-genre at best (which does not mean that it's worthless to analyze them as fantasy literature), and that movies and literature have partially different genre history, which means that "fantasy movie" and "fantasy novel" have slightly different connotations. <i>Avatar</i> is probably the weakest case in that lot for being labeled "fantasy", but I might easily be mistaken, given that I haven't seen it. In my imagination it's more of a very fluffy scifi movie - fantastic, yes, but with scifi structure and tropes.                        </div>

                            Well, that' some drift.  <br/>I was just eluding to the mysterious, horrific, and wondrous caverns of adolescence, and you guys had to get all colonial.  <br/><br/>I don't think D&amp;D is fiction, in the way that a book, like Gygax's shitty novels are.  I mean, if you stand there and recount last night games, then sure, maybe that's fiction(if you embellish), and I can maybe qualify that as something, but the game of D&amp;D has a theme, but not a whole lot else.  <br/><br/>Entertainment is a much broader word than fiction, so I would use that one.

                            I'm happy to wrap that part of the discussion here, but I should why I brought up Avatar:<br/><br/>It's clearly science fiction in terms of genre trappings, but the story is a colonialist one (literally). However, it takes the side of the "locals". Kind of like The Last of the Mohicans or The Last Samurai - similar basic plot, showing the valour of the "locals" in contrast to the evil of the invading colonists, even while showing us that their fate is basically doomed.<br/><br/>(Sometimes I wonder if Tolkien has a touch of that, too. The "white" good guys in the story, after all, aren't invaders exploring a brave new land; rather, they are defending their own land from the foreign invaders who seek to change their ancient and ancestral way of life.)<br/><br/>I also forgot to mention Narnia...                        </div>

Not that this is very relevant to anything, but I find it difficult to let this characterization pass when I could instead whinge a bit about Tolkien trivia.<br/><br/>Tolkien's heroes in LotR are as follows:<br/><br/><b>A bunch of hobbits</b> - literally adventurers who've left their homeland for the parts unknown. I think that it would be extremely disingenious to claim that they are "defending" anything given their haphazard understanding of the political situation outside their home. It is clearly more of a case of ideological alignment with a foreign cause.<br/><br/><b>Prince Aragorn</b> - The prince of a dead kingdom ideologically committed to the preservation of the ways of his ancestors. Fights to put down the ancient enemy, and to put himself on the throne of the other remaining Numenorian kingdom.<br/><br/>The reason for these being good guys in the story is that they partake of a civilization with spiritually good qualities, not that they are particularly defending themselves. They can be said to be defending humanity as a whole by proactively interfering in a war - defending the "free peoples of Middle-Earth" as the phrase goes - but that's not the same thing at all, or if it is, then this pro-active defense doctrine seems to make all wars defensive wars.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the ancient and ancestral way of life is arguably on the side of Mordor: Sauron is the ancient lord of these lands; Numenorians ousted him. I am not aware of <i>any</i> justification for this aside from ideological reasons and force of arms. Basically, the justification for the kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor (and Rohan by extension, the land being a grant from Gondor) to exist at all rests on either force of arms used in living memory (Sauron's, to be specific - all the mortals of the time have of course succumbed to its passing), or the ideological notion that Sauron is evil and therefore opposing him is an inherent good.<br/><br/>Tolkien very much argues for a global, moral, interventionist perspective on power politics. His councils and wizards and important people take the ideological framework as an obvious and primary context for determining action. The idea of self-defense justification does exist, but it's more for the laymen - the movers and shakers know that the conflict of ideologies/religions is inevitable, and thus the fact that Mordor has rearmed and flouted Gondor's territorial integrity is if not exactly irrelevant, at least an expected "sign" more than a fundament of moral logic. Mordor would be evil anyway, even if they didn't attack first.<br/><br/>All that aside, Tolkien has one boldly deconstructive theme in his epic: the main protagonists are everyman heroes who by and large do not triumph by force of arms. That's subversive in comparison to the standard treatment where "right makes might" - the chivalrous knight is stronger than the evil he opposes. With Tolkien it's more like "you may be weak, but fear not, for Providence is on your side." A much more Christian theme than most fantasy literature bears.                        </div>

                            When you consider D&amp;D adventurers often face technologically, physically and magically superior opponents it looks more like opportunistic barbaric raids on wealthier neighbours than modern examples of colonization. If anything I think real world colonialism has been overlooked as a great source of adventure fuel for D&amp;D, the exploits of the Conquistadors is the obvious one but there are several overlooked but equally fantastic (in both senses) adventures. The Battle of Cochin would be one hell of an adventure. The wikipedia article is a great read: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cochin_" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cochin_</a>(1504)<br/><br/>Highlights:<br/>- floating siege towers<br/>- an impossible defense made possibly by strategic use of tides<br/>- "untouchable" peasants winning a skirmish because their opponents literally didn't want to touch them<br/>- assassination attempt by cannon<br/>- assassination attempt by cobra                        </div>

                            Emma, I want to ask about your use of colonialist -- do you think that if something it colonialist, that makes it toxic and unusable for you?  To me, the world seems to be full of colonialist art and literature since humans have been conquering and exploiting each other for millennia now.  Shakespeare, Joseph Conrad, H.P. Lovecraft -- all are problematic, but also essential to my way of reading.  So fantasy is a problematic but also fascinating genre. <br/><br/>Besides, the enlightened thinkers of one era are misguided and problematic by the standards of the next, and we ourselves may seem like complete jag-offs to the shiny people of the future.                         </div>

I am not a vegetarian. I predict a few generations from now folks will naturally assume most of us didn't eat meat, because wow, and whenever they find out some famous nowadayser ate cows and pigs and chickens they'll be like "can we praise them for their accomplishments even though they were obviously terrible people? I mean there were plenty of vegetarians around at the time, it's not like they didn't <i>know</i>..."                        </div>

                            If D&amp;D has an identifying, peculiar genre behind the numerous authors writing many adventures and supplements over a very long time, it's murder hobo fantasy. <br/>It isn't rooted in specific setting and "colour" material, but in the rules: since PCs increase in power so vastly over common people, they are overwhelmingly, often ridiculously, more powerful and wealthy and competent than almost everyone else, to the point of doing what they want on a scale that would make a modern Satanist envious.<br/>Not only lethal violence is usually the fun and interesting course of action, but the choice between killing them all and being a nice member of society is an unusually constant and intense moral pressure, typically escaped from with an abundance of "monsters" that can be treated as enemies for some reason and are, power-wise, in the same league as the characters.                         </div>

                            I'm sorry, I didn't realize you were being facetious! It felt like a genuine question, but maybe that's because I'm very used to most of the communities I'm in being very anti-capitalist, having a very negative view of most of the "great" Western authors, and being places where things like sensitivity readers are not only desirable but considered almost mandatory when writing about oppressions and cultures that aren't your own. <br/>I'm sorry for the confusion! <br/><br/>I strongly disagree about stereotypes being useful for navigating reality, and am personally very against the idea that your perception is limited by the narration of an author or game master. I'm generally not a fan of the idea that the narration is even objective, and not just the narrator's opinion of what things are like (and opinions are very much colored by social biases, etc.)                        </div>

Can't people have reasonable disagreements on what genres and authors have such mistakes? And reasonable disagreements over what is and is not an effective approach to consuming media? You have your view and that is fair. But this seems like a very black and white view of things to me. Very few works of art in this world are pure. Everything is rooted to a time when things we regard as right may not have been the norm. It seems like throwing the baby out with the bathwater to remove something as wonderful as Shakespeare from your life. I remember reading a lot of the works of Christian writers for example who were dealing with ancient greek and Roman texts (and they seemed to have similar difficulty). The Romans (and the Greeks) did a lot of terrible things, and for Christians in particular there was a lot they would have found morally objectionable about them that we wouldn't, but there is also a lot to be gained reading their myths, their poetry and the works of their historians. I am not very convinced that using the tropes, even if they are rooted in bad things, so easily taint us.<br/> </div>

I'm not the world's biggest Harry Potter fan, but it seems strange to me to discount those books as fantasy (not only are they clearly fantastical and draw on fantasy tropes, but they also feature typical fantasy story stuff like archetypes of mentors and the Prophesied One, etc).<br/><br/>China Mieville's books use lots of fantasy conventions and tropes, too, but they have very familiar colonialist themes, in the traditional fantasy sense being discussed here. It's just that they take the side of the oppressed more often than the colonizers.<br/><br/>What do people feel about those two works? <br/><br/>And how about these?<br/><br/>* Star Wars<br/>* The Neverending Story<br/>* The Last Unicorn<br/>* The Princess Bride<br/>* James Cameron's Avatar<br/>* His Dark Materials<br/>* The Wheel of Time <br/>* A Song of Ice and Fire </p></div></blockquote>
<br/>I read his Dark Materials, and I quite liked the prose (I remember enjoying the descriptions of objects in particular). But I did feel like the hostility toward C.S. Lewis kind of overwhelmed the work a bit (it came of as a bit teenage angsty to me, stuff I might have said when I was in high school for example). I did enjoy  it, I just found that tone a little disruptive to the story. <br/><br/>These days, I find the idea of twisting or flipping tropes kind of dull (it seems just as paint by numbers as using tropes). I've been reading a lot of wuxia material in the past few years and one of the writers, Jin Yong, set out as his standard to always make new characters, characters he had never seen before in literature (to the best of his ability). There are still trope characters, and some of the them are even flipped, but they are all quite unique and interesting. So you will definitely encounter the 'helpful old man' character, but he will be unlike any helpful old man you ever meet (just look up Zhou Botong for example: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhou_Botong" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhou_Botong</a>). I think this kind of approach is quite good. Or to use another example, in legend of Condor Heroes trilogy, Yang Guo, the protagonist of the sequel, is the son of the bad guy (or one of the major bad guys) from the first story. It is kind of like trope flipping, but felt so much richer than how it is done here (and it still cleaved to plenty of standard tropes in the process). What is particularly interesting about the second story is you basically get to see Yang Guo interacting with all the major characters from the first book, but you see them more through his eyes than through the eyes of Guo Jing (the protagonist of the first book). It doesn't retcon, it just casts a slightly new light on them.                         </div>

I don't agree with Emma's D&amp;D is fascist argument, but I don't think that means we have to buy into stereotypes either. If we are talking about dwarves and elves, and stereotypes regarding these kinds of fictional races, that is one thing. But I think walking around life with stereotypes about Asians or Latinos is going to lead you to have more bad interactions with people than good. I've worked with a lot of people from Asian countries for example, and stereotypes are really one of the worst guideposts for dealing with people from those cultures. Obviously some people will conform to stereotypes (my mother is a stereotypical Italian American mom). But even in those cases people are much more than the type and you will miss all the people who don't conform to the stereotype if you are  using it as a lens that guides you through the world.                        </div>

                            Emma is using the same argument as the “mainstream” lit people who used to argue that all science fiction is crap, and if confronted with, say, “Brave New World” or “Fahrenheit 451”, would retort that those aren’t SF because they don’t have spaceships or ray guns or bug-eyed aliens.<br/><br/>This is, I believe, the “No True Scotsman” argument, in the form of:<br/>Hypothesis: All X is crap<br/>Observation: Y appears to be in X but is not crap<br/>Conclusion: Therefore Y is not actually in X<br/><br/>Which says nothing about category X; it’s simply drawing a wiggly line to enclose stuff you think is crap.<br/><br/>As a tangent, I’ll note that if we define colonialism as the belief that other tribes are beneath us and we should conquer them, then that makes most human societies ever colonialists. (Not to mention chimpanzees.) Which makes the term fairly useless as a pejorative.                        </div>

It's hard to stay on topic when you basically ended the discussion in the initial post, saying the symbolism was clear as day. I'll make a short post about things I think are beyond obvious and hopefully someone is surprised or disagrees.<br/><br/>Young people without guidance or oversight from their parents (they were killed by orcs) take their spears and swords (penetrators) and enter a dungeon (vagina). Down there their hit points and spells (vital essence) is spent but they return to the surface richer and stronger (becoming wise adults). <br/><br/>You always remember the first time you played D&amp;D. It is often awkward unless an older player showed you the ropes.                        </div>

If you have personal experience that may be relevant, I think it is fair for you to share it. I don't think people should automatically agree with you though because of your background or skin color (or because of the history of colonialism). People are making an assertion about how prevalent colonialist tropes are in D&amp;D, and what effects those have on the culture and individuals. I think there is a strong argument to be made that D&amp;D isn't as colonialist as people are claiming, but even if it is, that its impact on things is fairly minimal. This is like the old violence in movies/video games and satan in music arguments we heard when we were kids. A lot of it was based on information that turned out to be wrong. I've seen these kinds of arguments a lot in recent years (similar to the D&amp;D is fascist argument). I haven't personally found them very convincing. Especially the latter, because it seems to stretch the real meaning of fascism in order to make its claim. <br/><br/>I just do not believe the argument that making RPGs with these kinds of tropes in them, is the thing that perpetuates all the badness in society. <br/><br/>One thing I think is worth keeping in mind, on gaming forums like this, we rarely know anyone's cultural background, ethnicity, etc. Most of the screen names are not even good indications of those kinds of details. I don't know how many people who are unpersuaded on this front are white or not.                         </div>

Agreed!<br/>There's definitely been points where I've felt like this thread has turned into "My elfgames are being attacked" in a lot of really unfortunate ways instead of people listening on subjects of colonialism and other linked oppressions. <br/>Which I would largely call a product of how much those types of oppressions are swept under the rug in most of the Western world, the US especially. The fact that they have a societal excuse for it doesn't make it any less exhausting though.                        </div>

                            My experience is that most of us here are eager to learn about new stuff, new perspectives or even about each other.<br/><br/>I agree with <a href="/forums/profile/snej">@snej</a> and <a href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">@Bedrockbrendan</a> about genres and colonialism but I am happy to reconsider my views if I meet new information.<br/><br/>It doesnt have to be 'objective', 'factual' or even 'well argued' because subjective accounts are often very good for witnessing different perspectives and helping the listener to become more sensitive toward particular issues. You know, the 'roleplaying-effect'!<br/><br/>Still I think there are things to be expected.<br/><br/>I start to have problems when the information is presented <i>against</i> me. When I feel lectured or treated in an offhand manner as if I am a bad student because I havent heard about something so I should not ask or raise dount but shut up and ashamed. Or as if a bad teacher were trying to hammer a nail into my head.<br/><br/>Also, I think that making bold statements without backing them up is very contraproductive.<br/><br/>This two cases could often provoke stances of 'devils advocate' in me where I feel obliged to counterbalance the oversimplifications or defend something which was treated in an unfair way.<br/><br/>I am sure I am not alone with these things.<br/><br/>tl;dr: I am happy to listen if the speaker is talking to me using the win-win frame.                        </div>

                            Should you ask a moderator to sink or lock the thread? It might not be as stylish as getting it to stop just by asking, but it's all-around easier. People aren't that good at coordinating crowd action, after all. Easier if a leader uses authority.                        </div>
