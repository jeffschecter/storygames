There'll be just the two of us, but I'm optimistic based on my one experience with the game that it will still work.  We're playing it without a GM.  If anyone sees anything misguided or silly we are doing, please chime in and share your wisdom, because mine is only a '10'.<br/><br/>First of all, I told Ami that I thought she should point all of her characters 'best interests' at my characters and I would do the same for hers.  I also suggested that if something needed to happen between two of her characters or two of my characters, then we had carte blanche to say how that worked out.  It just seemed reasonable to me and I didn't want to take over one of her characters to play against another of her characters or have her have to deal with taking over one of mine.  Maybe this wasn't worth stating. <br/><br/>So the oracle said:<br/><br/>The sorcerously animate homunculus of a wizard, more clever than wise.<br/>A chattel slave who has broken his bonds and his master's skull.<br/>The local lord's daughter tramping after strawberries.<br/>An oasis of sweet water in a barren wilderness haunted by the shadows of some vast atrocity committed centuries ago.<br/><br/>And from that we extracted these characters:<br/><br/>Ami's:<br/>Homunculus<br/>Covertly 8; Directly 10; For Myself 12; For Others 4; With Love 6; With Violence 6<br/>Strength:  Small and Stealthy, Potent d10 for Covertly<br/>Best Interests:  To eat the Wizard's heart, setting me forever free.  To consume Lord Rogarth, thereby becoming him.<br/><br/>Lord's Daughter -- Dahmira<br/>Covertly 6; Directly 10; For Myself 6; For Others 8; With Love 12; With Violence 4<br/>Best Interests:  To turn the slave, Kyr, in for murder.  To keep and befriend the wizard's homunculus.<br/><br/>Oasis Ghost<br/>Covertly 12; Directly 8; For Myself 6; For Others 6; With Love 4; With Violence 10<br/>Strength:  Terror -- Far Reaching, Affects For Others in the form of nightmares and such.<br/>Best Interests:  To terrorize the Lord, the descendant of those guilty of the atrocity.  To attract Kyr to the oasis to show the atrocity so the story lives on.<br/><br/>Mine:<br/>Wizard -- Phantalos<br/>Covertly 8; Directly 10; For Myself 12; For Others 4; With Love 6; With Violence 6 <br/>Strength: Magic, Affects Directly, Far Reaching in the form of all kinds of fantasy magic.<br/>Best Interests: To recapture my homunculus.  To Sacrifice the lord's daughter to elevate my magical might.<br/><br/>Lord Rogarth the Red<br/>Covertly 6; Directly 6; For Myself 4; For Others 12; With Love 10; With Violence 8 <br/>Best Interests: To keep my daughter locked up in the castle.  To keep people away from the cursed oasis, because the ghost has a secret that would cast doubt on my line's legitimacy.<br/><br/>Slave -- Kyr<br/>Covertly 12; Directly 6; For Myself 8; For Others 4; With Love 6; With Violence 10<br/>Strength:  Bloody rock used to crush master's skull.  Consequential,  Affects Directly (stolen shamelessly from Dictionary of Mu)<br/>Best Interests:  To silence the lord's daughter.  To capture the homunculus and return it to the wizard for a reward.<br/><br/>Now I've only played once, so I feel like I'm fumbling in the dark here, but I added the strengths to two of my guys and then helped Ami figure out strengths for her two guys and she seemed happy.  I don't feel that I have my mind fully wrapped around what you can do with strengths yet.<br/><br/>So, I began to frame the first scene where Dahmira witnesses Kyr crushing his master's skull and then I noticed Ami nodding off, not because these guys don't seem cool, but because it was really late.  Looks like we won't get started until Saturday night.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125911">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ShaneJackson" title="ShaneJackson"><img alt="ShaneJackson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ShaneJackson">ShaneJackson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125911/#Comment_125911" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-12T01:47:47+00:00" title="February 12, 2008  1:47AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay.  We didn't get a chance to play any on the weekend, so we did our first session after work on Monday (we actually work 2nd shift, so technically it was early Tuesday morning).  After we get home Ami doesn't stay alert and functional for very long, so we didn't approach this with the idea that we would finish any significant portion of it in one night.  I didn't take any notes, so I may not remember the minutiae of how things played out--forms used and whatnot.  Also, I learned that I need to give the rules another read-through.  Anyway:<br/><br/>We started the session by describing all of the characters.  We decided to do this because I said something on the car ride home that indicated that I thought Dahmira was a little girl and Ami said "No, she's in her twenties".  So we decided that maybe it was worth describing all of our players before the game so there wouldn't be any in-game misunderstandings of this nature.<br/><br/>We decided that the oracle's mention of the oasis meant that we were obviously in a dry place and that securing water either was or is a pressing issue.  In the end it looks like the city's wells are beginning to dry up and Lord Rogarth is wrestling with what to do since he instinctively doesn't want people to go to the oasis where the ghost dwells.<br/><br/>We started with a scene where the slave Kyr has been toiling as a farmhand out in the hot sun and his master has come to beat him with a switch.  Nearby Dahmira, Lord Rogarth's daughter searches for strawberries.  So Kyr kills his master rather than take the beating and Dahmira stumbles upon the scene and is immediately chased by Kyr who wants to leave no witnesses.  She runs through some corn and drops down into a dry irrigation ditch, but he knows the area like the back of his hand and cuts her off by racing through the corn to emerge at a place in the ditch between her in the city.  He hits her in the head dazing her and she scrambles for a stick, but he knocks it out of her hand and strikes her harder in the head, knocking her out and splitting her scalp.  Since I can't decide she dies and I knew Ami wasn't going to let me kill her, I narrated that he thought she was dead and heard people coming, so he ran for it.  Is that how the rest of you guys do it?  Kyr went on the owe list.  <br/><br/>I also realized my first real confusion of the game.  I was using the Bloody Rock which is Consequential and affects Directly.  If I exhaust someone, do I reduce Directly by two die sizes and With Violence by one?  I decided injure was more appropriate so Ami reduced Directly, Covertly and For Others.  Ouch. <br/><br/>So, next scene, the 18-inch tall, crudely-formed homunculus is caged at Phantalos's tower and notices that objects have been left to close to his cage, so he manages to grab something that allows him to pick the lock and get out.  He jumps up on the wizard's table and looks through the books to find a way to make a sleeping draught, which he quickly mixes and puts into Phantalos's water pitcher.  Phantalos comes in and drinks it and notices that the cage is open just before he passes out.  So then the homunculus leaps back up on the table and tears out all of the pages about making a homunculus and escapes out of the tower.  He makes his way to the nearby gardens, finds a rabbit hole, eats the rabbit, makes a blanket out of its hide and begins to peruse the wizard's texts.  At this point Ami raised her arms in the air (like a homunculus would) and shouted in a squeaky little voice "I will be an all-powerful wizard" which had me laughing for several minutes.  The forms used were even, so no one went on the owe list.  We decided it made more sense for the story that the homunculus to have to learn that he should eat the wizard's heart rather than cut it out and feast on it in his first scene.  I guess I could have had the wizard become a lich if that had happened.  I'm curious what other people do when someone wants to cut out your heart and you don't want them to, but you lose.  Is it just always foiled narratively until later in the game where forms have been more reduced and removal from the game is actually possible?  Boy does that question sound dumb.<br/><br/>In the final scene of the evening, Lord Rogarth is notified that his daughter has been injured and she is brought in on a stretcher.  He decides that he must confine her to her room and lock her away from the rest of the world, but Ami isn't having that and she totally destroys my roll in the first round.  After she's healed up for a few weeks she tells him she won't let him imprison her and he impotently replies "Well, if anything else happens to you, then you have to stay in the castle".  Ami said she especially liked that part and Dahmira went on the owe list too.<br/><br/>And that scene brought up another confusion.  Vincent says that you shouldn't roll dice while people are talking, even if it gets heated.  Roll dice when people act.  I guess that doesn't preclude the action of making a decision, such as a father deciding that his daughter will be locked up.  Anyway, that's how we played it because it seemed like a conflict to us.<br/><br/>So it was a slightly shaky start, but we both look forward to the next session.  I've not seem a game like it for watching story form before your eyes, and it looks like it will be fun to see how it all plays out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_125912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125912/#Comment_125912" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-12T03:46:30+00:00" title="February 12, 2008  3:46AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ShaneJackson</cite>And that scene brought up another confusion.

Here's my take on the answer that was given:<br/><br/>Keep on talking all heatedly until someone does something that someone else can and will resist. Here's an example:<br/><br/>A man and a woman can woo each other all night. If the man's player says that he woos her back into bed with him and the woman's player objects, then the dice come out. Basically, until talking leads to an action, don't roll. I can imagine that it will be obvious. You'll go from 'in-character' to 'out-of-character' statements.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125953">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125953/#Comment_125953" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-12T09:06:49+00:00" title="February 12, 2008  9:06AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ShaneJackson</cite>...At this point Ami raised her arms in the air (like a homunculus would) and shouted in a squeaky little voice "I will be an all-powerful wizard" which had me laughing for several minutes. </blockquote>\nHehehe! I had a moment like that once. I was playing a solo adventure for my brother, and he has this elven druid. At some point he got to fight some little critters, who turned out to be Lepreuchans. When he was apologizing for shooting an arrow to one of them (which caused a mere 2 hp of damage), the little guy said in a squeaky, high, distressed voice "you almost killed him!". Boy, he laughed for hours.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
