(An endless stream of deal with it sunglasses falls from the sky onto every dog in the world.)<br/><br/>At my elementary school the art teachers were a team of two and they were very cool, relaxed, chill, and at the same time very serious about what they were teaching.  When you're in elementary school and the teacher is joking around and being hilarious, you will relax and have fun. When the teacher is serious but chill, you will relax and really think about what you're doing. So that's what happened.  Art class was not considered a "fun" class at our school. It was a real class!<br/><br/>Here's what I learned from my elementary school art teachers:<br/><br/>Everyone should be an artist - everyone can and should create art all the time. If you give a presentation to a committee at your workplace, and you pay attention to the aesthetics and effect of your choice of words and explanation, then you are being an artist (the art of rhetoric to be specific).  Doodling idly isn't art not because doodles can't be art, but because you're just doing it idly. If you're doodling to try to represent something or express something, if you're conscious of your work in any way, your doodle is art. If you write down a dream you had and give it to a friend, that can be art if you are trying to convey your experience in the dream.  If you draw a picture of someone and you're trying to get across anything other than just remembering how they look, that is art.  Basically if you do anything for any expressive reason whatsoever (as opposed to, say, taking notes for class so you remember it or doing your taxes so you don't go to jail) then that is art.<br/><br/>As a direct result of this incredibly expansive definition, you are responsible for your art. If you draw a mean picture of a classmate, even if you never intend for them to find it, you are responsible for the hurt it might cause if someone else sees it - or, they pointed out, the hurt you might do to them because your own thoughts and feelings in creating your mean picture will stay with you, and even if you change your mind, you can't change the picture. If you draw a picture and 20 of your friends are fine with it and 1 is hurt by it, you are still responsible for the hurt.  Of course in elementary school we were taught we never should hurt people.  But this lesson, like the best lessons, took on a new meaning as we grew up and realized that we did have the capacity to hurt people, and would, inevitably, in our time on this earth, hurt people.<br/><br/>The second thing we learned was that because everyone can and should be an artist every day, virtually all of what they create will be garbage.  Believe me, this was a hard lesson for a fifth grader to learn.  I didn't actually absorb it until I was over 20.  My mom said I was really smart and talented! Why is this art teacher telling me that maybe I need to practice to get good at drawing?  (This is why I am bad at drawing.)  <br/><br/>And just as your amazing robot monster sculpture may turn out looking like trash, your supposedly innocent creation may hurt someone without you meaning to.  Your intent doesn't make your robot monster sculpture good - not even your imagination makes it good!  Only your <i>work</i> will make it good.  Your ideas can't save you, your work is what counts.  So if you hurt someone, and you didn't mean to, it will almost always be because you didn't work hard enough on it.   You didn't understand something about the world or the situation.  (Just to allay anyone's school/kid/youthful esteem-related upset, art class was primarily about <i>improvement</i> under this model.  "Compare this drawing to the one you did just two months ago, see how much better it is? Show it to your partner and talk about how each other have improved.  Okay, let's talk about our next project.")  Sensitive people are doing you a favor if they react badly to your work, because insensitive people will miss parts of what you're doing, overlook some things or not think them all the way through.  Sensitive people show you where you need to work.  Similarly if you did something that all your friends like because they get the in-jokes or have all watched the same dumb cartoon or whatever, that's fine, but lazy, and the first non-friend person who says "I don't get it, that seems horrible/stupid" is actually helping you far more than your backslapping jackass friends, IF you are interested in improving your work.<br/><br/>I think virtually all of what RPG players (of all kinds) and designers do is art by this very expansive definition.  It's art, but art is no big deal - kids fingerpaints put up on the fridge are art, an 8th graders mix tape for their secret boyfriend (OKAY, WHATEVER THE KIDS ARE DOING THESE DAYS) is art.  RPG participants create not just for purely administrative or intellectual purposes, but for our own aesthetic pleasure, whether that be in a well-turned strategy, a fun portrayal of a character,  a satisfying plotline, or even just something we will enjoy with our pals together (sum that up and that's Creative Agenda, BTW.)  As a result, our RPG play and design carries responsibility, and the way to carry the responsibility has nothing whatsoever to do with our intent, but instead, with our <i>work</i>.<br/><br/>Even if you don't agree with this definition of art, and there are certain things about it that I don't agree with nowadays, I do agree very strongly with the allocation of responsibility for expression.<br/><br/>Or, as I might say if I was a 1950s boss who drinks two martinis every day for lunch and smokes a cigar, "<i>fuck</i> your pure heart, get back to work."<br/><br/>I'll get more specific on RPG stuff in the next post.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418490/#Comment_418490" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-16T20:50:40+00:00" title="July 16, 2013  8:50PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So in RPGs there's designers, and art director, and artists, and sometimes (often) these jobs overlap.  Then there's a GM, and players, and sometimes these jobs overlap.  All of these people bring to the table their own prejudices, they live in their own society with their own cultures, they have their own unique experiences, and they each contribute to the final outcome of RPGs: improvisational play of characters in fictional situations.<br/><br/>So when we talk about harm in RPGs, whether through racism, gender stereotyping, misogyny, religious bigotry, or whatnot, we have to determine who has what responsibility to who.  Designers are insensante, unresponsive, distant creators of texts that communicate primarily in an oblique way about an event that the players may or may not experience.  So we should be able to hold them to the standard of creators of other texts, like novels.<br/><br/>But that is not the whole story. The vastly more powerful and, frankly, effective, participant in RPGs is the <i>player</i>.  Whereas the designer must make their intent known through whatever godawful text they happen to be selling, the player is a physical person saying and doing things at a table.  So we should hold them to the standard of physical people saying and doing things at a table.<br/><br/>This is where things like the Pathfinder map start people talking past each other.<br/><br/>Some people are saying "hm, this seems pretty shit when I look at it on the wall", and others are saying "well, at the table it's not like that", but they are not talking about the same things.  The first group of people is concerned about the designer/company as creator of text and images. The second group of people is concerned about the players of the game as fellow improvisers.<br/><br/>This is a really unique thing about RPGs - a thing that is true for us that isn't really true for any other medium (or maybe it is true for all other media but we don't consume those in the same way).  <br/><br/>Is a player who plays a game with racist material in it, but whose game and play do not include references to the racist material responsible? For what are they responsible? Obviously the game's creators have more work to do if they want to improve their material and not harm people.  They are responsible for the hurt  their work causes.  But is it possible to play such a game in a way that means you, the player, are not responsible for the harm of "the game"?  In the end, what is the  game - the text, or the play?  <br/><br/>Did everyone who played AD&amp;D1, which contained crappy attribute caps for women that many groups discarded, bear responsibility for that stupid, hurtful rule?<br/><br/>Does every Vampire player bear responsibility for World of Darkness: Gypsies?<br/><br/>This is a real live question, remember my answer is based on the idea that we each bear responsibility for the harm we do.  <br/><br/>I think there are things AD&amp;D1 players could do that could express ratification of that rule even if they didn't actually use it - say they loaned their book to a friend saying "hey, check out this game we play on Tuesdays", or recommended it to a friend on the Compuserves.  Similarly with Vampire players who bought Gypsies not fully understanding what it was but didn't dispose of it once they got it, so that others would see it on their shelf or in their collection and see it as legitimate.  <i>I did this and it was harmful.</i>  (I may have even defended that damn thing on alt.games.whitewolf at some point - please don't do a search and prove exactly how awful I was in college.)  We can adopt horrible things as our own - and hurt people through our words like we can with any other words.<br/><br/>I told you all that so that when I get to what's next there's no question that I'm not talking about design. I know nothing about design or business or all the horrible compromises that go into everything I buy (but go to <a href="http://slaveryfootprint.org" rel="nofollow">slaveryfootprint.org</a> for some thoughts).  What I want to talk about is what we do at the table, because that's what I'm unquestionably responsible for as a player/GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418512">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418512/#Comment_418512" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-17T07:43:19+00:00" title="July 17, 2013  7:43AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Someone is probably rewarding the designers and publishers with money (if not a vote of agreement then at least some kind of positive reinforcement). A lot happens on the way to the table. <br/><br/>But fine. In the bubble of "what happens at the table," if you're not hurting anyone at your table, actively or passively, then keep on keeping on. Fantastic. <br/><br/>That doesn't mean that I won't find what you do at your table to be unethical or gross or hurtful, if you tell me about it. But again, you're talking about just stuff "at the table." That forces me into some bizarre argument where I'm theoretically hurt by some activity you might be doing at your table but not telling me about. Silliness. I won't go there.<br/><br/>So imagine some group is playing AD&amp;D and they're all REALLY INTO the crappy attribute caps for women. In fact, they treat women (characters) really, really poorly in the game, and it's not done out of some kind of moral statement. If any of us were to secretly watch their game, we'd be pretty sure that the players themselves have something against women. Is that problematic? Yeah, I think so. But they're not hurting anyone, so carry on, bigots!<br/><br/>It's probably not even a matter of harm or no-harm. I think what matters is actual harm to non-consenting people. A group is free to play whatever they want as long as they all consent to it and they don't harm anyone who doesn't consent to it. I can get behind any behavior as long as it's "safe, sane, and consensual," to borrow an old phrase from elsewhere. <br/><br/>Play doesn't bother me at all. It's when play reflects something ugly about the person itself, that I get edgy. I'm not concerned that Bob and Jo are playing racists. I'm concerned that Bob and Jo might actually be racists. /Being a racist/ doesn't harm anyone, but it's indicative that they will harm someone or make it easy for other people to harm someone. ("Harm" in the most general sense.)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418515/#Comment_418515" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-17T08:00:45+00:00" title="July 17, 2013  8:00AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Adam, I'd say that within the bubble there's plenty of room for one player to impact another.

It's the same reason I don't want games covered with "half naked women chained to posts", it gives us a bad rap.<br/><br/>As for "On the Table" the setting and the mechanics will influence play. Play influences the narrative, narrative influences perspective, perspective influences how we interact with the real world.<br/><br/>Back in the day I used to play board games at a local game store on monday nights. We shared the room with a loud D&amp;D group. I often overhead very racist, sexist, misogynistic comments coming from that table, and it made me some combination of uncomfortable and offended. These guys were reinforcing to each other their views and beliefs and giving the hobby a VERY bad reputation. Now, I couldn't "blame" the game at all, but if the game did have these elements baked into the setting or mechanics, it would have shared the blame, as it "encouraged" the behavior.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418519/#Comment_418519" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-17T08:39:12+00:00" title="July 17, 2013  8:39AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with <a href="/forums/profile/Jacob">@Jacob</a>!

That said, I don't think RPGs are as unique as we are describing in the distinction between "the product as designed" versus "the product as experienced by those who use it." And this is a problematic distinction, as it does describe something real, but it creates a false "out" for defensive people to hide behind, incorrectly claiming that what happens in private stays in private. <br/><br/>Do you remember that old show <i>All in the Family</i>, the one about a lovable bigot named Archie Bunker? Ostensibly, the show was poking fun at the main character for his prejudices, showing that he wasn't a bad guy, but he had some bad ideas he needed to get over. Research of TV viewers found something kind of dismaying, though: People with more progressive views on race got the intended purpose of the comedy, while people with more conservative views on race loved the show and appreciated Archie Bunker as an everyman hero telling the hard truths about the world that others needed to hear.<br/><br/>I'm not pointing this out to blame the creators of <i>All in the Family</i>. You can encourage people to interpret your messages in one way over others, but at the end of the day, it's out of your hands. Rather, I point this out for two reasons: first, because I think that for any form of entertainment, RPGs or TV or whatever, there's always going to be a certain disconnect between "what they put into it" and "what we got out of it." And second, I point this out because I hope it points out that there is still a party involved here who is not absolved of responsibility: we, the audience, even when consuming things in the privacy of own homes.<br/><br/>The fact that media are open to interpretation does not mean that media have no capacity to influence us; it means that we have even greater personal responsibility to think critically about what we consume and how we interpret it. (I arguably come from a biased perspective on this, having once been a Communication professor; that last sentence could've been etched above my office door as the Official Departmental Credo.) Some messages are subtler than others, of course. Companies spend so much on advertising, and governments spend so much on propaganda, because years of scientific research have demonstrated pretty clearly that media can influence people's behavior \u2013\xa0maybe not all people, maybe not all the time, maybe not even in huge ways, but even a little bit of influence can add up over time when you think about how much entertainment we consume on a daily basis. But while an ad is trying to nudge our behavior a wee bit in a specific way \u2013\xa0pick this fizzy drink over THAT fizzy drink next time you want some sugar water \u2013\xa0entertainment media have the capacity to subtly our very <i>beliefs</i> about how the world works <i>without even trying.</i> <br/><br/>Maybe this sounds kind of abstract, so let me give one more example. I once read a fascinating study in which participants were asked to estimate the number of doctors and lawyers in the population at large. One group estimated <i>way</i> higher than expected: people who regularly watch daytime soap operas. It's (probably) a totally harmless belief, but the study was conducted as an apolitical demonstration that our entertainment habits can color the way we see the world.<br/><br/>For this reason, I don't think that gives anybody a free pass for what goes on in the comfort of their own homes, alone in front of the TV or among close friends around the gaming table. I'm <i>not</i> saying that we need to feel guilty all the time for possible insults against people who will never hear them. I'm saying we need to be mindful of the stories we consume, and the stories we tell, because certain tropes have been so ingrained in our pop culture already that it's sometimes easy to miss how problematic they can be until you take the time to really <i>think</i> about what we're doing. Yes, we have more freedom to determine what content actually goes into our stories than TV viewers have over their stories. I encourage us to use that freedom to actually think about and discuss the material we play with, as we're doing here \u2013\xa0not necessarily to blame or to condemn those who err, and not even to constantly self-censor out of a constant paranoia that we might hurt someone who may or may not ever be hurt. Rather, thinking about and discussing these things critically helps us fix ourselves, and fix our cultures, so that the problematic elements are hopefully less problematic in the future.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jacob" title="Jacob"><img alt="Jacob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jacob">Jacob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418522/#Comment_418522" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-17T09:04:13+00:00" title="July 17, 2013  9:04AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 17, 2013 9:09AM by Jacob.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I realize I didn't answer JD's questions about 'who is responsible'... but I guess it's because I have trouble placing blame or responsibility.

Seems to me the hobby is small enough that Designers and players are pretty closely intertwined, even for the 'big' players in the industry.

It's the same reason I don't want games covered with "half naked women chained to posts", it gives us a bad rap.<br/><br/>As for "On the Table" the setting and the mechanics will influence play. Play influences the narrative, narrative influences perspective, perspective influences how we interact with the real world.<br/><br/>Back in the day I used to play board games at a local game store on monday nights. We shared the room with a loud D&amp;D group. I often overhead very racist, sexist, misogynistic comments coming from that table, and it made me some combination of uncomfortable and offended. These guys were reinforcing to each other their views and beliefs and giving the hobby a VERY bad reputation. Now, I couldn't "blame" the game at all, but if the game did have these elements baked into the setting or mechanics, it would have shared the blame, as it "encouraged" the behavior. </blockquote>\nGreat examples, Jacob. Jackasses may be jackasses no matter what they play, but there's no reason we should give them tools that make it even easier to be jackasses.

I don't know how much good we'd do by kicking in people's doors and shouting at them for being asses in their own homes.<br/><br/>However, I'd humbly point out that there's more going on here than hurting people's feelings in the immediate sense. The entertainment we enjoy can potentially influence the way we see the world in general. If our games reinforce problematic ideas, then we increase the likelihood that we'll take those ideas with us even after we leave the gaming table. <br/><br/>If I can offer an admittedly imperfect analogy: There's a lot of interesting (and troubling) research about the effects of watching a LOT of porn. And we're not just talking about unrealistic laboratory measures here \u2013\xa0one study found that both men and women who were paid to watch tons of porn were WAY more lenient in suggesting prison sentences for convicted rapists. Over time, the porn slowly changed the way people thought about how big a deal it is to have sex with someone who's unwilling (because after all, in porn, women are only "unwilling" until they realize that they're really into it after all). That is a really telling and disturbing effect with significant, real-world consequences. <br/><br/>Does that mean people should be disallowed from enjoying porn in the comfort of their own homes? Nah, not necessarily. But still, it helps illustrate that what people do in private still has the potential to "hurt" somebody \u2013\xa0even themselves \u2013 in other contexts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418540">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418540/#Comment_418540" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-17T12:13:25+00:00" title="July 17, 2013 12:13PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 17, 2013 12:22PM by RobMcDiarmid.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [crossposted a bit cause I was long winded]\n<blockquote>I'm rereading Jason's posts (and I did give them my full attention the first time, ahem).

I'm saying that if they're not hurting each other, I don't really care what they do.</blockquote>\nIf they're not hurting each other, was the problematic game content they were engaging with actually hurtful and problematic? If you don't care what they do outside of the narrow context of "hurting each other at the table", then how was the problematic game content problematic in the first place?<br/><br/>JD is saying (or I should say "What I'm getting from what JD is saying is...") that by engaging with the content in a way that accepts and reinforces the negative stereotypes and then bringing those stereotypes away from the table with you into how you interact with the rest of the world, you bear full responsibility for your actions as a player and person. That's where the real potential for hurt lies, and the player bears the brunt of responsibility for it.<br/><br/>[edited to add - Also at the table hurting each other too. That's also bad.]<br/><br/>Furthermore, what I am seeing in what he is saying is that these choices and creations made by players at the table are more important than the material they are engaging with in the first place.<br/><br/>I'm not quite 100% on board with that statement, (I think there is room for both improving the content as well as for players improving themselves as people) but it has some interesting outcomes.<br/><br/>Say, for example, that as a game text creator you create The Birth Of A Nation playset. It's full of KKK dudes and Northern carpetbaggers and recently freed slaves trying to establish themselves as sharecroppers and all that contentious stuff. As a text creator, you are definitely responsible for what you put in and don't put in and how you present it, yes.<br/><br/>But as a playgroup picking up The Birth Of A Nation playset, the players are also creators. They are responsible for their own actions and choices and creations.<br/><br/>If one group has their characters put sheets on their heads and run around lynching the black folks and the Northern sympathizers and spouting out negative stereotypes left and right, then that group of players is responsible for their actions. They are also responsible for any ways in which those choices spill out away from the table and into the rest of the world. If they go forth and commit hate crimes after having played several sessions with The Birth Of A Nation playset, the people, not the playset, are responsible for those crimes.<br/><br/>If another group plays out a Django Unchained style campaign using The Birth Of A Nation playset, having a freed slave and a white sympathizer work together to kick some bigot ass, then they are also fully responsible for the choices they have made for how they interact with the playset and the world. If they go forth and kick bigot ass in the real world, the people, not the playset, are responsible for those outcomes.<br/><br/>Personally, I'm all on board with the idea that consumers are responsible for their choices. And this is extra true in RPGs, where consumers are heavily positioned as co-creators as they consume. It is not really possible to fully consume and utilize an RPG text (ie. actually play the game) without creating art while you are doing so. And, as he says, you are responsible for your art.<br/><br/>And I think JD is also subtly suggesting a course of action in the face of problematic content, and one that makes a lot of sense. If you don't like it, don't buy it. <br/><br/>If you do buy it before you realize how bad it is, get rid of it when you do. <br/><br/>Or, alternately, choose to engage with it in a positive constructive way. And when you talk about it with others, let them know what sort of efforts you felt you needed to go through in order to get at the positive potential in the product (Ignore chapter 3, it's horribly racist and almost makes you a worse person just by reading it, but use chapter 4 cause it's great stuff, for example).<br/><br/>All this is not to say that content can't and shouldn't be improved. Content creators are responsible for their creations and choices and omissions and all that. But RPG players are co-creators as well. They bear a level of responsibility as well. And, if they choose, RPG players are fully capable of engaging with problematic content in a way that is positive.<br/><br/>But yeah, sometimes it's harder with subtly problematic stuff. That's totally true. Better content is easier to have positive interactions with.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418543/#Comment_418543" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-17T12:16:28+00:00" title="July 17, 2013 12:16PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>JasonT: </b><br/><br/>I'm starting to feel like you're misrepresenting me (not intentionally, but gah, this is frustrating).<br/><br/>I was trying to take Jason's (JD's) given frame and engage him as he asked: people at the table. Not people after they left the table, or people buying games before they came to the table. Just people at the table. Maybe I misunderstood what he was asking, but that's what I was doing.<br/><br/>I didn't say that people's behavior in private can't have later consequences in public. Of course it can.<br/><br/>I didn't use the term "hurting people's feelings." I said /hurt/ people. Your argument there is a total straw man. Furthermore, if people want to let someone else hurt them in a safe, sane, and consensual way, I'm behind it. Go for it. <br/><br/>When people's behaviors spill out into greater society and hurt people who don't consent to it, that's a problem. I made that point in my first post. "<i>A group is free to play whatever they want as long as they all consent to it and they don't harm anyone who doesn't consent to it. I can get behind any behavior as long as it's 'safe, sane, and consensual,' to borrow an old phrase from elsewhere,</i>" I said.<br/><br/>If people want to watch a lot of porn, good for them. If they allow it to change them so that they become desensitized to rape and suggest more lenient prison sentences for convicted rapists, that's a problem. (And maybe they're watching the wrong porn.)<br/><br/>You said: "I think it's good to avoid condemning people. I don't know how much good we'd do by kicking in people's doors and shouting at them for being asses in their own homes."  I have no idea why you told me that. It's as if you told me it's good to avoid lighting people on fire. I'm not advocating kicking in doors anywhere. That aside, if people are actually racists and that seeps into their game play, then I feel right in condemning them <i>for being racists</i>. I can't condemn them for doing racist things in their game without a deeper understanding of what's going on, though.<br/><br/>Most of the time I've ever posted stuff about racism in D&amp;D, with one or two exceptions, I've done so from the point of view of my <i>own table</i>. Stuff that personally makes me uncomfortable. In one case where I called out other people, it was calling out privileged white dudes who were telling minorities that the issues the minorities perceived were not real.

If you don't care what they do outside of the narrow context of "hurting each other at the table", then how was the problematic game content problematic in the first place?<br/></blockquote>\nThat first question is a frame shift. The content was "problematic" only axiomatically because we started with that as a definition in our outside, theoretical frame. Here's some problematic content. Let's imagine some players engaging it. By definition, we accept it as problematic. Then once it's inside the frame of the players at the table, they don't find it problematic. That's fine. They play with the content. Maybe they don't have a problem with it, maybe they do. No one at the table gets hurt. Was it problematic to begin with? Yes, because we picked content that we agreed was problematic. If it wasn't, we would have chosen other content that was. If there's no content that we can agree is problematic to begin with, that's a different argument.<br/>\n<blockquote>JD is saying (or I should say "What I'm getting from what JD is saying is...") that by engaging with the content in a way that accepts and reinforces the negative stereotypes and then bringing those stereotypes away from the table with you into how you interact with the rest of the world, you bear full responsibility for your actions as a player and person. That's where the real potential for hurt lies, and the player bears the brunt of responsibility for it.</blockquote>\nGuns don't kill people; people kill people?<br/>Cigarettes don't kill people; people smoking kills people?<br/><br/>I'm afraid this boils down into a libertarian argument that is going to have a handful of pretty polarized sides, and none with a monopoly on the ultimate truth. <br/><br/>I think that if people have responsibility for what they do, then that has to include everyone, otherwise the blame can be shifted to the victim. If designers aren't responsible at all for how they represent women and rape, then why are players responsible at all for how they act towards women? Let's just blame the women. It doesn't work for me. If a player is responsible for his actions outside the game, then a designer is responsible for his actions, too. It's obviously a completely different class of responsibility, but it's there. <br/><br/>At the very least, <i>I get to criticize designers for making stuff that I find morally lacking</i>. And that's what started this thread. Someone asked, "Hey, is this thing here morally lacking?" (okay, "ethically problematic"). And some people think it is, and some people think it isn't, and some people don't know. Basically, the consequence that may result is some criticism and maybe some loss of sales. That's what is at stake here.<br/><br/>The subtext of what people are asking seems to be, "If game designers produce material that expresses racist, sexist, and otherwise bigoted views, what's the harm?" My answer is that game design art is no different than other art. If it's expressing racism or sexism or hatred, it's still art, and I have to figure out how I want to engage with it. I might go to a museum and look at a painting I find "ethically problematic," and just move on. I can enjoy it for what it is. However, I won't buy it and hang it on my wall, because the subtext there is "Hey, everyone who visits my living room, I endorse this artist's message of racism." If I buy a game that seems to treat women as second-class citizens, from art to setting to character to pronoun choices in the text, and I tell my friends, "You have to play this awesome game!" and we all play it every week for a year and never say, "You know, this is pretty messed up," then that's something like my racist painting on the living room wall, especially if other people know about it.<br/>\n<blockquote><br/>[snip]<br/><br/>And I think JD is also subtly suggesting a course of action in the face of problematic content, and one that makes a lot of sense. If you don't like it, don't buy it. <br/><br/>If you do buy it before you realize how bad it is, get rid of it when you do. <br/><br/>Or, alternately, choose to engage with it in a positive constructive way. And when you talk about it with others, let them know what sort of efforts you felt you needed to go through in order to get at the positive potential in the product (Ignore chapter 3, it's horribly racist and almost makes you a worse person just by reading it, but use chapter 4 cause it's great stuff, for example).<br/></blockquote>\nAll the stuff I snipped is good stuff. We're in agreement about how you engage with a game being important. I think we're probably in agreement with all this stuff.<br/><br/>Right. Giving people money for their art is how society encourages artists to do their thing. We can engage with "problematic" art and not endorse every view they have. See the hoopla about Orson Scott Card's homophobia and whatnot. Nonetheless, if you eat at Chik-fil-A, know that they're gonna spend the money you give them actively trying to hurt gay people. There's a moral issue there for me.<br/><br/>Does that mean I don't buy a book just because it has a chainmail bikini on its cover? No, but the cover probably gives me pause. It means that I'll probably apologize to my friends when they see it on my table. "The rest of the book is okay," I'll say, if that's true. I think you have to call out bad behavior, even if it's the behavior of a bunch of game designers and artists and editors that you've never met.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418546">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418546/#Comment_418546" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-17T12:49:12+00:00" title="July 17, 2013 12:49PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>(I wonder if SLOW DOWN should be pre-emptively established for this thread.

I don't think I misrepresented you, but I did communicate some things poorly, and I think you misunderstood my intentions. I certainly don't mean to be antagonistic. I'm just trying to broaden the scope of what we're discussing in here.\n<blockquote>I was trying to take Jason's (JD's) given frame and engage him as he asked: people at the table. Not people after they left the table, or people buying games before they came to the table. Just people at the table. Maybe I misunderstood what he was asking, but that's what I was doing.<br/><br/>I didn't say that people's behavior in private can't have later consequences in public. Of course it can.</blockquote>\nYou said: "I'm not sure how five people role-playing at a table can have any affect on people outside that group."  I was trying to explain how five people role-playing at a table can affect people outside their group. <br/><br/>You said: "I'm not saying that people can't hurt each other at a table. I'm saying that if they're not hurting each other, I don't really care what they do." I was trying to suggest that there are ways things can go wrong without directly "hurting each other."\n<blockquote>I didn't use the term "hurting people's feelings." I said /hurt/ people. Your argument there is a total straw man.</blockquote>\nMy apologies for my poor word choice. I wish I'd written instead, "I'd humbly point out that there's more going on here than hurting people in the immediate sense." Again, I was trying to broaden this discussion to argue that "hurting people" is not the only negative effect that we need to worry about here. It is not clear to me why you would call this a "straw man." \n<blockquote>If people want to watch a lot of porn, good for them. If they allow it to change them so that they become desensitized to rape and suggest more lenient prison sentences for convicted rapists, that's a problem. (And maybe they're watching the wrong porn.)</blockquote>\nThe specifics of porn effects is a tangent for another day. The real takeaway I was hoping to communicate here was that it's not that we "allow" media to change us \u2013\xa0it's that these kinds of effects can be so small and subtle that we don't even realize when they're happening, and they happen to us all the time. The best we can do is mitigate that effect by talking intelligently about such effects, as we're doing right now.\n<blockquote>You said: "I think it's good to avoid condemning people. I don't know how much good we'd do by kicking in people's doors and shouting at them for being asses in their own homes."  I have no idea why you told me that. </blockquote>\nThis was an unfortunate miscommunication (or misunderstanding). I was trying to open my post by saying, "I agree with you that we should not come down harshly on people for what they do in private, particularly when they aren't being actively harmful." As a rhetorical technique, the intent was to establish some common ground with you before suggesting a point I thought you might be overlooking, but might still be receptive to. Apparently, my phrasing was so ambiguous that it backfired.\n<blockquote>Most of the time I've ever posted stuff about racism in D&amp;D, with one or two exceptions, I've done so from the point of view of my <i>own table</i>. Stuff that personally makes me uncomfortable. In one case where I called out other people, it was calling out privileged white dudes who were telling minorities that the issues the minorities perceived were not real. Mostly though, I'm concerned about my own table. I don't want to be an asshole, and I already have a few strikes against me (only in terms of being aware of minority issues!), having grown up as a privileged, white, middle-class male. That means I have to work harder not to be an insensitive asshole.</blockquote>\nWe are coming from the same perspective and we seem to have pretty much the same politically progressive beliefs (or at least aspirations), so I'm not really sure what you think we're disagreeing about. Maybe it got lost in the way I phrased things, but all I'm really saying here is this:<br/><br/>1) Sometimes, people say and do problematic things even when they're not obviously "hurting" anybody.<br/><br/>2) Doing or saying something problematic doesn't make a person "the enemy." We're all susceptible to absorbing problematic cultural myths (especially us privileged white dudes, considering that all the oppression that doesn't happen to us is far too easy to miss entirely). Whenever possible, it's better to educate ourselves and one another than to place blame and attack people.<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure we're on the same page with that stuff, right?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418553/#Comment_418553" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-17T13:19:51+00:00" title="July 17, 2013  1:19PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not trying to justify PF creators, though as a creator I'd like to add that no creator actually wants to be racist, mysogynist, etc. It's just that we have an opinion, which can easily be (besides of wrong, biased, uninformed, etc) just poorly communicated, misunderstood or misinterpretated. It happens sometimes. <br/><br/>Some other times, it's just plain racism, homofobia, etc and everybody should react to it, I agree. Stating your opinions, documenting and defending them is important. But judging others isn't. Judging others isn't the point of it all. Take that material and use it as you want, ask the creators to change anything you find offensive for you, it's your right as consumers.<br/><br/>But whenever a discussion about bigotry arises I feel more offended by the people who singles out every small prejudiced detail only to end up condemning the whole. If the whole game is meant to be prejudiced and offensive, laugh about it, since <a href="http://wiki.rpg.net/index.php/Worst_RPGs_ever" rel="nofollow">it obvious nobody will stand it enough to take it seriously</a> If small portions of it are offensive, ok, point it out, the creators probably didn't meant it but they are still responsible and should change it.<br/><br/>The other thing that offends me the most is when somebody picks up a fight in someone elses's name withouth bothering to ask if they are actually offended and want to fight for it. <br/><br/>I mean, I'm Peruvian, I know, I respect and I love my culture, and I'm not offended when somebody uses it in their game. I'm sad when they use it poorly because I know it's richier than that and the feeling they are getting from it is limited to a narrow experience of it. But for all I see, that person isn't commiting a crime nor I'd call it Cultural Appropiation. If a designer creates a fantasy world where my country is habited by stupid chickens (which is the term people from other countries in south america use despectively for Peruvians), I wouldn't be offended, I'd be sad that their vision is so limited by their prejudice that they ended up making an unispiring game. Perhaps I'd point that to the author and hope he corrects it, and most probably I won't buy that supplement or the game.<br/><br/>But what I wouldn't stand is having other people who are not peruvians put words in my mouth and saying all peruvians are or should be offended by that game. That would be our fight if we choose it and I would be glad for the support if it comes, but having other people start a preemptive war in my name because there is a chance I might be offended feels like that people is patronizing me by thinking I don't have an opinion or a voice of my own. Their assumptions might be right but acting violently based on assumptions is just the stupid old reason the world keeps going wrong all the time.<br/><br/>So please, by all means, tell those PF guys their map looks stupid and it's ruining their marketing strategy and image of a non-prejudiced RPG. But let the people who may or may not actually be offended by it know about it before you pick up your torches and congregate a mob on Paizo's door. Us minorities have a voice, and we aren't always offended.<br/><br/>BTW, do you wannna know what Cultural Appropiation is really all about? There's an old town here in Peru called Pisco, which makes a wonderful liquor from grapes, which recives the name of the town. A few years ago, a town in Chile changed it's name to Pisco and the Chinenian government started to spread information at international level that the liquor they made there, also called Pisco, was the original one and the peruvian Pisco was a bad copy. Now<b> that's Cultural Appropiation</b>, an actual crime and something that we peruvians really find offensive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonT" title="JasonT"><img alt="JasonT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonT">JasonT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418554/#Comment_418554" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-17T13:22:49+00:00" title="July 17, 2013  1:22PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>The subtext of what people are asking seems to be, "If game designers produce material that expresses racist, sexist, and otherwise bigoted views, what's the harm?" </blockquote> Woah who said that??

What I'm saying is "don't criticize RPG players for the hurt RPG creators do, and don't criticize RPG creators for the hurt RPG players do". Don't let one try to get the other off the hook either.  And furthermore, don't defend one when someone is criticizing the other.  <br/><br/>In fact, defending something from criticism is not even really an appropriate response, because criticism - real criticism expressed in a way that you can engage with, is a GIFT.  It is an unmitigated positive <i>to the creator</i>, assuming that the creator wants to improve their work and you want them to, even if the criticism has race or gender or religion or some other "hot button issue" (ugh) at its core.<br/><br/>There's some weird outliers that may come up from time to time - maybe you don't care if Paizo (or whoever) improves their work or not, so you don't write your criticism in a way that can be engaged, so you're not really contributing, even if you're right (this is how I normally mess up threads, by the way, I say something unquestionably correct that nobody can do anything with).  But in general I think people who engage with RPG stuff enough to really be interested in whether it perpetuates racism or sexism or whatnot are people who really want RPG stuff to be better, and not hurt people, and should write their criticisms accordingly.  Or maybe Paizo (or whoever) doesn't care to improve their work, they are like the fifth grader who is drawing stupid cartoons for their stupid fifth grade friends and they get everything they need from their friends' admiration, in which case the criticism is useless because they have no reason to ever change.  But in general I think RPG creators even at the Most Biggest Non Indie Companies (tm) want their stuff to be better and not hurt people, and should read criticisms accordingly.  But under no circumstances is a criticism of a Paizo decision (like the map in the other thread) a criticism leveled at a <i>player</i> of Pathfinder, so the player really has no dog in the fight, no skin in the game, and, most important, no reason to defend the decisions that went into creating the map.<br/><br/>Again, as I say above, there's some ways that a player can adopt what a game creator does - hang the map on your wall, point it out as being awesome, use hurtful mechanics, etc.  So that behavior can be evaluated and criticized, but it ought to be evaluated and criticized on its own merit, not as part of a critique of game design or game-art design.  Maybe you lay the map out on your table and say 'this part of it is really cool, this stuff over here isn't right and is kinda racist, so we're not using this'.  And that behavior can be evaluated and criticized too.  (It could still be shocking or harmful.  "Am I playing this game with a guy who buys racist stuff?")<br/><br/>What I am trying to say is that what <i>I personally feel qualified to talk about in some kind of depth</i> is not game design or commercial decisions because, in my inestimable purity, the whole concept of designing and selling a game seems insane and ludicrous to me.  So for me when I weigh in on these discussions (and what I'm going to talk about more in the thread), I am talking about players and GMs and their respective responsibility.<br/><br/>2 - I think the theoretical 'table full of bigots' example is a bit of a red herring. It's not really what I was talking about. If you handcuffed me to a radiator and demanded I identify the harm done by such play, I would say that the reinforcement of bigoted beliefs is harmful even to those who carry the beliefs, but that's not what I'm getting at.  I'm (going to be) getting at portrayals that actually hurt people, make them feel unwelcome, belittle them, threaten them.  It's not always limited to your table (consider a convention scenario, or an online game played "in public", or when discussing games, or choosing a game to play, or any number of other social connections that are part of play), but even if it is, as I say in my first post, even if you never actually hurt anyone except one person, you are still responsible for that hurt.<br/><br/>I feel like I'm spending a long time getting out of the blocks on this one so thanks for your patience and sorry for any miscommunication.

I've been tilting at windmills, it seems. Don't bother responding to it line by line. I was just really way off base with what you wanted, I think. As far as I can tell, you and I agree on most of this stuff.<br/><br/>That said, I thought you were asking us some questions, and at this point in time, I have no idea how (or if) you want us to engage with you. Should I just sit quietly and wait for your next big post? <br/><br/>If you want my input, what questions are you asking? <br/>\n<blockquote>Is a player who plays a game with racist material in it, but whose game and play do not include references to the racist material responsible? For what are they responsible? Obviously the game's creators have more work to do if they want to improve their material and not harm people. They are responsible for the hurt their work causes. But is it possible to play such a game in a way that means you, the player, are not responsible for the harm of "the game"? In the end, what is the game - the text, or the play? <br/><br/>Did everyone who played AD&amp;D1, which contained crappy attribute caps for women that many groups discarded, bear responsibility for that stupid, hurtful rule?<br/><br/>Does every Vampire player bear responsibility for World of Darkness: Gypsies?<br/><br/>This is a real live question, remember my answer is based on the idea that we each bear responsibility for the harm we do. </blockquote>\nThose are your original questions, but I'm not sure how you want us to answer it in the context of your last bit, "<b>What I want to talk about is what we do at the table, because that's what I'm unquestionably responsible for as a player/GM.</b>"<br/><br/><br/>Once you're at the table, you've swept past the design process, the marketing and selling process, the purchasing process, the group's game selection process, and a lot of other things. I think the places where you're "unquestionably responsible" start much earlier than "at the table," though, at the point of purchase. If you know AD&amp;D is horribly sexist, and you go and give Wizards of the Coast a bunch of dollars for the reprints, what's your culpability?<br/><br/>I think I answered that question earlier. You just rewarded the artist/producer/distributor for their content. It's a vote of confidence. If someone says something racist and you /clap/, you're an asshole too. If a street performer sings songs about raping women and you drop a dollar in his hat, you're an asshole too, even if the guy is a really good singer. I know some people disagree. I think some RPG folks believe that art is just art and it doesn't say anything, but I could be misrepresenting a more nuanced argument.<br/><br/><br/>I think the responsibility of a gaming group for the materials they select for play is pretty damned small. Added up over thousands of gaming groups, that's a fair amount of responsibility. If all of them stopped buying racist content, maybe people would stop selling racist content. I think consumers have to change their market; don't wait for producers to do it. Artists should produce whatever the fuck they want to make, though. If they want my dollars, though, they should avoid offending me. Maybe they don't care about me, because there are plenty of purchasers who aren't offended, or maybe they want to offend people. Art is weird. I get that.<br/><br/>I'm also not sure what assigning responsibility for anything really <i>means</i> here. What changes as a result? Some twunts on Story Games have determined that players (or designers) are (or are not) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">responsible</span> for game content.

That's how you ethically determine how to reward them with your money.<br/><br/>Truth is--and I remember flinching when I read this--Dragon Magazine sold more copies when they put female cheesecake on the front. When they put a dude on the front, they sold fewer copies. One of the editors or art directors knew this. It was a hard fact for him. So what does that mean? It means, even if he wants to avoid cheesecake, he has a fiduciary duty to his employer to put the cheesecake on the cover. We can wait for him to rebel against his employer (and get fired and get replaced with someone who will choose the more profitable art option), or we can use our purchasing power to influence the publisher.<br/><br/>And all of that preceding paragraph avoids the question of whether any women are harmed by cheesecake covers, naturally. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>EDIT: Oops!

Personally, I'll buy entertainment that has some really problematic elements when (a) the problematic stuff is just ignorant bits and pieces here and there that don't overwhelm the good stuff for me, (b) I don't think the product was knowingly or purposefully doing stuff that I find extremely disagreeable, and especially (c) when the creator is open to correcting their own mistakes.<br/><br/>So, for instance, I have bought a lot of comic books, video games, and RPGs with some pretty crappy representations of race and gender. I criticize them for it, but I'll still give them my money if they're otherwise great products. But I've stopped buying certain creators' products when their racial/gender portrayals have gotten so over the top that I can't even enjoy them without going, "Dude, have you ever even SEEN a woman's body before? Do you even KNOW any black people? Come ON." And I've actively avoided products by certain creators with politics I strongly disagree with even if I rather liked their earlier work (e.g., Orson Scott Card).<br/><br/>That's just entertainment, though. I feel a lot guiltier when I stop to think about how my smartphone was made, and I don't stop to think about it that often.<br/><br/>EDIT: Erg, sorry, "SLOW DOWN" wasn't there when I started replying, and I don't think I'd ever seen it on a thread before, so I missed the significance of the reference earlier.

No amount of diligence or work on my behalf will permit me to fulfill my responsibility.<br/><br/>I think that the art-teacher view of "who did you hurt" is better.  It means that although I bought a DVD of "Birth of a Nation", and someone made money from selling it to me, the harm of that should be measured differently if I project it on a sheet I hang on the side of a NAACP building or if I discuss it with my historical movie club after screening it in my house.  The latter could still be damaging, of course, and I could still be responsible if my discussion and presentation is filled with slurs and praise for the "studied realism" of the film, but the former is a whole different world of awful.<br/><br/>But just buying it didn't hurt anyone.....or did it?

Maybe they're hurt because they find it painful to think about somebody else thinking in some way, or their identity is being questioned by the art. In an extreme case the art could actually be physically hurtful, like music played too loud or dehumanizing visualizations force-fed upon an audience, although I think that this fringe case might as well be forgotten for all the practical impact it's had on modern society.<br/>2) Your creation causes people to adopt evil (or undesired, whatever) thoughts and actions. You are, in a word, influencing the world towards ill nature.<br/><br/>Are there other ways for an act of creation (communicating your creation included) to be harmful?<br/><br/>For my own part, I'm willing to discount that first scenario for practical purposes, it's not a valid criticism of anything that it offends somebody. It's just not. Saying otherwise is basically just giving up on freedom of expression as a social principle; either you accept that saying things is always better than having them be unsaid, or you set up somebody (maybe everybody) to determine what things are acceptable to be said. Sure, allow people also the right to determine what they desire to hear, but merely calling the expression of a message a wrong is something I'd expect from a person who hasn't thought through the alternatives, which have all generally been worse. I'm especially not fond of the chilling and dehumanizing effect you get when a society determines that certain thoughts are offensive and not proper to bring up to discourse; this goes for e.g. radical feminism as much as white power racism, I think that advocates of both should be treated humanely in civil discourse as a first basis for a society ruled by reason and individual rights.<br/><br/>(I should note here that Jason's scenario of writing something specifically to hurt somebody comes under the second heading there, at least when you use your art to cause public shame upon your victim. And I fully agree with Jason that a person engaging in such dark practices is doing mental harm to themselves, twisting their skills towards ill deeds.)<br/><br/>Scenario number 2, on the other hand, seems to me like a solid case: given that we're desirous of virtue, and given that we believe in the power of art to move people, it seems that we have a responsibility towards contributing to a cultural environment that encourages virtue. However, even here I have to say that I object to the simple school-marm way of going about this: disallowing wrongful messages and encouraging rightful ones. The problem in this seemingly sensible approach is that it begs the question awfully hard: the school-marm who decides for you which RPG texts you should boycott is unfortunately not omniscient, so how can they know a priori which texts are worthless and harmful, and which aren't, without perfect knowledge of the past and the future on which to base their judgement? Furthermore, on what strength of pedagogy has it been established that virtue grows on a soil of ready-made answers devoid of all history and variety of thought?<br/><br/>(An important secondary point on the pedagogy of culture, and philosophy of knowledge in general: do you believe that truth will out, given means of exploration, or do you believe that truth is just like lies, and people cannot really distinguish between the two without a greater power telling them? I believe the former, which belief makes me not really worry too much about e.g. people learning to be racists by reading a lot. If you read a 100 racist books and a 100 anti-racist books, the one thing I believe is that you're likely to form an opinion that's close to the truth on the matter. I don't need to determine the truth for you in advance, in other words, I only need to give you the means and the motive to think for yourself.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418576/#Comment_418576" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-17T16:25:55+00:00" title="July 17, 2013  4:25PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Continuing my post due to the character limit, here.)<br/><br/>Due to these misgivings, I tend to advocate for cultural liberalism when it comes to the responsibilities of artists and the culture industry in general: support people's self-fulfillment and growth, and you're doing what you're supposed to do. This can be achieved with an amazing range of means, given the wide variety of human needs we are serving with culture (our own included). It can range from introducing people to new ideas, to undermining the old, to elevating their appreciation of what they already know, to reminding them of what they've somehow lost, to allowing them to work through their own thinking in various ways. Also, we are none of us the gatekeepers of ultimate wisdom; I think that it's the height of arrogance when people not only determine that they disagree with a message, but also decide that nobody should hear it, for it has nothing anybody should need to hear. How do you know that?<br/><br/>As for practical conclusions from these tenets: I will listen to your message, even when it is one that I disagree with. If your thinking is interesting and your craft good, I'll advocate for others to check it out, even if the message is one I disagree with. I routinely recommend many types of culture to people, very much regardless of whether it agrees with their worldview. I've smuggled pornography to teenagers, read massive amounts of Christian literature, debated with Hare Krishna, visited Stormfront, read through the entire <i>Capital</i> (and <i>Atlas Shrugged</i>), and so on; these experiences are enrichment, not scars upon my being.<br/><br/>Being more specific to roleplaying, I think that it is, indeed, difficult to achieve a depth of iniquity where dealing with stuff with your friends could actually be said to be harmful. I mean, we can speculate about a gaming group that gets together weekly to reaffirm their mutual misogyny or racism, but is that actually harmful? I mean, it could also be that these hypothetical bigot gamers need this social outlet in their lives - lives no doubt pretty scarred and hard otherwise, to be cursed with these sorts of coping mechanisms. (In case it's not clear, my currently favoured view on bigotry is that it seems to be a way people cope with circumstances beyond their own control; secure people seem to rarely rely on these modes of thinking.) One might speculate that gaming with same-minded peers in an environment friendly to their thinking might indeed reaffirm and bolster their convictions, but to me it seems equally likely that such a group is in a bad place to begin with, and nothing would change if you took away their game. Besides, it is always possible that, should their craft be true, they'll explore themselves out of bigotry. Why should active, intelligent gaming lead only to reaffirming beliefs you already hold? I think that the only way to ensure you're stuck in your current place is to stop the seeking.<br/><br/>(Anybody finding it ludicrous that deeply bigoted people would seek to better themselves: I recommend getting to know a few troubled people. Read the aforementioned racist website Stormfront for a while. I think you'll find out that people hold onto beliefs because they work for them, but regardless of their worldview they seek virtue the best they can, even in the most macabre pits of self-affirming ideology. My experience on these basketcases - to put it frankly - is that even they do their very best to work around their chosen modes of thought, and towards a better and more human world. Immense contortions are attempted to portray e.g. a white power worldview as egalitarian, just and spiritually meaningful, even towards people of supposedly lesser races.)<br/><br/>With all this in the background, I suppose it's not difficult to see why I might find it annoying when people get all moralistic about somebody publishing wrong ideas. What if some rpg book depicts a retrograde attitude towards e.g. women? It's far from given that you're reading the author's actual thoughts, as they might merely be true to the shape of the thought they're exploring. Even if the author were actually advocating misogyny intentionally, did you ever ask whether they're actually making a good case? (Or a better case, at least - presumably, if misogyny is ultimately wrong, there is no truly good case for it.) Even if they were merely exploiting an ignoble marketplace, shouldn't you be more angry with the degenerate customers than the author? Is it really your social philosophy that ideas should not compete freely, but rather be shut down by social activists pressuring the publishers and authors to only publish what the lobby group deems worthwhile? Stamp out bigotry (however defined) by preventing the bigots from publishing?<br/><br/>I guess what I'm saying, when it comes down to it, is that you should hate bigotry (insofar as is expedient with the proviso that emerging conditions might make you change your mind later), and maybe even hate the bigot if you have to, but don't hate on the culture industry for publishing bigoted culture alongside everything else. Without the bad ideas to compare to, how do you know that your ideas are any good? Test your truth bravely against the truths of others, if you truly have faith in it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418581">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/creases" title="creases"><img alt="creases" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/creases">creases</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418581/#Comment_418581" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-17T19:17:07+00:00" title="July 17, 2013  7:17PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 17, 2013 11:08PM by creases.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It still boggles me how hand-wringy this topic always turns out.

If you're not the target of the insult, you might not notice it. Doesn't mean it's not there. Even if the creator didn't intend it to be!<br/><br/>We can criticize something for its problematic aspects without hating it, abandoning it, or wanting to censor it. And we can play games, read books, and enjoy art without defending their problematic aspects.<br/><br/>If creators make a problematic game, and players play out those problematic aspects to the full, uncritically---well, sure, the players are responsible for their part of that, for choosing to play that way, for replicating and enacting insults and wallowing in the poor taste. Heck, they might do that for the most innocent game. But just the same, the creator is responsible for their part, for offering a product with aspects that are insulting or in poor taste, if that's what they've done.<br/><br/>Asking creators to be more sensitive, voluntarily, isn't a grievous infringement of their free speech. Neither is choosing not to support their work financially when they don't make any effort to do so.<br/><br/>Nobody is asking for anything more than that: for creators to be more sensitive and more responsible, voluntarily, to the implications, connotations, and context of their words and imagery. Why is that so offensive? I mean, I know it's a challenge for creators, but it's not, you know, a massive burden or impossible puzzle. Why do creators need these wordy exculpations letting them off the hook from just, you know, being less casually dickish?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418582">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418582/#Comment_418582" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-17T19:22:07+00:00" title="July 17, 2013  7:22PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            creases, your post is great and I agree with like, basically all of it.<br/><br/>You can like problematic things.

I don't think I've ever seen condemnation lead to better art.<br/><br/>"Bullshit/boring/lazy/cliched/tedious as fuck/shitty" sounds like hating to me.<br/><br/>Is anyone familiar with <i>Fortune's Fool?</i>  Its setting is, among other things, a mash-up of real world cultures and religions with fantasy races.  If you read it, I have no idea what impression you'll get of the creators.  It wouldn't surprise me if you spot some problematic stuff!  But please, don't assume they're evil, and that the evil has been done, and that's the end, and all you can do is vent and stand up for your values.  None of that is true.  I know the game's creators, and they do care, and they do listen seriously to critical feedback, and they are publishing adventure modules, and they are totally down to improve their art.<br/><br/>Separately, I'd like to point out that while too much cliche is boring, a complete lack of familiarity is disorienting.  World-building is a juggling act on this score, and not every failure is evidence of laziness or bigotry.

Wonderful.<br/><br/>Some more thoughts: Oppression is hate, my frustrated reaction to oppression is not hate.<br/><br/>This is not an old vs. new argument. Old things are good, new things are good. Often, older things have cultural things in them our contemporary culture no longer agrees with, for humanist reasons. Changing those cultural things to reflect our new cultural things, especially on the behalf of people who have historically been oppressed, IS GOOD.<br/><br/>I love old things. I love Conan, and Tolkien. Do I think they have some major problematic issues? Yes! Do I think it would be more useful and progressive for these genres to abandon those problematic issues, and keep the rest of the genre we love? YES. Do I think this is in any way harmful to that genre? FUCK NO. In fact, the more problematic issues we can remove, the more we're doing to help that genre grow and be better and more accessible to the people that care about it. If a genre relies on problematic issues to exist, it's not that great to begin with! But none of these genres do rely on those things! They're rich, and full of other stuff that we can keep intact once those problematic things are removed. SOMETIMES, we can take those problematic issues and wield them ironically, FOR GOOD. Subverting genre tropes is fabulously fun and often eye opening! ALSO, why keep telling the same story in the same genre over and over again? MAKE THINGS NEW AND BETTER. All good art does this. It steals from the old, and recombines it to create something new. <br/><br/>I mean, but don't take my word for it.

Creases and anansigirl definitely have some good insights into what I am about to talk about, I may be slow getting there but here we go.<br/><br/>The reason I responded in the Pathfinder thread with "but what about 1923 America" is because I think referring to real historical settings and play is probably the clearest way to handle these types of questions.  The veil of fantasy can be used to erase many things for good or for ill. I'll talk about that later. But let's talk about "real world gaming".  I fully understand that historical RPG play is fairly rare (all RPG play other than D&amp;D play does not exist, except within the margin of error) but it's something I've always loved and it's where I've done the most harm, so it's where my mind always goes when I think about these things.<br/><br/>Everyone in the other thread who said "well, it all depends on how you present 1923 America" was right on target, but I think the implications of this are under-examined.  It can be just as damaging to omit depiction of prejudice from a presentation as it can be to include it too uncritically.  Some people can even be harmed by any portrayal of certain things.<br/><br/>I accidentally learned this and put some of it to use in late high school/early college when I did a Vampire game set in the late 1800s. A young woman was portraying a woman character and I portrayed some pretty aggressive anti-woman sentiments through various NPCs.<br/><br/>(Is it indicative of how pervasive this issue is in the hobby that I feel compelled to add "but not rape! she didn't get raped everyone, not even back then would I go that far, christ".)  <br/><br/>Like a lot of people, she was playing a character that was basically an extension/fantasy about certain aspects of her real life self, so this hit a lot of buttons.  She got freaked and she told me about it.  And my first instinct was to get defensive. But that's how it waaaaas, I'm the GMMMMM, what about ~my unmatchable vision~...<br/><br/>Then I remembered my elementary school art teachers.  I hurt her, so it's my responsibility.  If I want to improve, the solution is more work.  I wanted to improve and she was here to criticize what I was doing, so she was here to help me.  I gave her some open-ended questions, let her discuss how she felt about everything, how she responded to everything.   (I say "let her" because of my first, ultra-defensive, instinct described below...)<br/><br/>It turned out she decided she actually quite liked having prejudices in the game, because she felt that the dark-fantasy theme was aided by having people look down on what they thought was "just a foolish, weak woman, but I repeat myself, right guyz??!" which turned out to be a cunning, blood-drinking, supernatural beast in human form.  But to get that benefit, I didn't need to be so aggressive in portraying those prejudices.  I started to come up with ideas: Maybe not using actual words or slurs, but instead describing the statements made by NPCs.  <br/><br/>Also, I was standing up when I portrayed the NPCs, and I was super-tall and she was not at all, so there was a physicality to the portrayal that went too far for her.  She knew I wouldn't actually hit her, but the threatening feeling of some of these NPCs was shading too far into the real world.<br/><br/>I had to do some <i>work</i> to improve my GMing.  And it <i>was</i> improved, we really created some good energy together as the game continued.  It would not have happened if she hadn't criticized me or if I had been standing there defending myself and my best efforts as blameless.<br/><br/>Now let's be clear - even when she criticized me, I didn't feel that anything I was doing was "wrong".  In other words, I had an absolute justification for every decision I made in every portrayal I made, even standing up when I played an NPC (body language, etc.)  If I had wanted, I could respond the way a lot of people respond when they're accused of racism/misogyny - I could just start listing the reasons I did things the way I did them.  "Well, these attitudes were prevalent in the place and time I'm portraying them, and it's not me saying those things, it's an NPC, and, and and..."<br/><br/>That isn't work, that's the avoidance of work.  That's justifying the lack of work.  That's just putting your feet up and saying "well, it's good enough".  <br/><br/>And maybe it is good enough! I could have just said "it's not going to change, see you later" and asked her to leave the game.  (This is the approximate equivalent of the 5th grader saying 'my stupid cartoons make my stupid friends laugh and that's good enough'.)  But that means I would be throwing away an opportunity to change, improve, adjust the tools in my toolbox, develop more skill with other tools. Even in high school I took my gaming at least seriously enough to want to do it better.<br/><br/>So this is why I think a lot of the discussions of bigotry in gaming go awry, because criticism isn't seen as a chance to improve offered by someone who has an emotional stake in the quality of your performance or creation, it's seen as an attack that must be defended against.  As if I have to defend every action I ever take in my life as "not racist", "not misogynist", etc. rather than thinking, "well, maybe something I did was racist or based on racist ideas, or perpetuated a racist stereotype...what can I <i>do</i> about that? What's my plan?"  In the historical RPG context, maybe I wasn't clear enough that a noxious idea was being expressed "at arm's length", that I did not subscribe to them, or maybe I didn't give sufficient room for players to respond to them.   Maybe I thought I did but it wasn't perceived because my performance wasn't good enough or clear enough.<br/><br/>(There are many reasons this model doesn't work/apply as clearly to designers/consumers as it does to relations between players.   Imagine the young woman in my story above was paying me to be in my game, or I was paying her to be in my game, or we were both paying a third party to be in the game, and think how that would completely change the meaning of absolutely everything we said to each other. But there may be some insights there too.)<br/><br/>In a later game set in a semi-fantastic early 20th century, I portrayed a racist, said some racist things, and one of the players blurted out "Oh shit, this guy's an asshole!"  Completely ruined the in-character mood, flow of in-character conversation, etc., and was absolutely the best thing that could have happened at that point in the game.  Everyone re-affirmed and agreed in this modern day real world that those attitudes had no place or validity.  There was a tension that was relaxed.  Dropping out of the portrayal of history for a few minutes actually made us feel the weight and significance of the history more.  That player did me a huge favor. I'll always be grateful to her for that.<br/><br/>So next I'm going to talk about some techniques, still staying within that historical RPG context, that I've found useful in different ways to decrease the risk of hurt that players might suffer from those portrayals. After that, maybe I'll weigh in a little on the role of fantasy in this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418648">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonT" title="JasonT"><img alt="JasonT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonT">JasonT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418648/#Comment_418648" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-18T19:49:26+00:00" title="July 18, 2013  7:49PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">@JDCorley</a>: Thanks for taking the time to bring this all together. Looking forward to your next post.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/creases">@creases</a>: Well said. Your comments remind me of a <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/alyssa/2011/11/02/358908/five-facts-about-misogyny-and-popular-culture/" rel="nofollow">short and insightful piece</a> by Alyssa Rosenberg about the tension (or it-doesn't-have-to-be-tension) around consuming entertainment media with elements of misogyny. If I could adapt a few of her points to this conversation:<br/><br/>1. Just because the people of oppressed groups buy problematic products does not mean that those products aren't problematic.<br/><br/>4. Feminists/progressives/liberals are not always looking for something to be angry about. But it\u2019s hard to overstate the sexism/racism/homophobia/inequalities in American popular culture.<br/><br/>5. Demanding better isn\u2019t trolling.<br/><br/>6. Liking art that is misogynist, racist, sexist, or homophobic doesn\u2019t necessarily make you those things, and indictment of that art doesn\u2019t have to be an indictment of you.<br/><br/>It's a failure to recognize that last point in particular, I think, that leads people to be so defensive about this sort of thing. Many (but thankfully not all) people were extremely dismissive and rude when Willow asked on the Paizo message boards whether Pathfinder's setting (or at least one poster) is ethically problematic. Despite the defensiveness and verbal abuse, however, the question finally got (what I read as, anyway) a <a href="http://paizo.com/threads/rzs2pyhf&amp;page=8?Is-The-Pathfinder-Setting-Ethically-Problematic#359" rel="nofollow">sensible and sincere response</a>, with a pledge to always try to do better, from somebody at Paizo. <i>Demanding better isn't trolling;</i> as Jason points out, it's a gift to those who are wise enough to listen to criticism.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/creases" title="creases"><img alt="creases" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/creases">creases</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418653/#Comment_418653" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-18T22:24:03+00:00" title="July 18, 2013 10:24PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 18, 2013 10:24PM by creases.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I figure maybe it's worth linking to the thread that took place the last time this stuff came up, which was in January ("Annual"!

I could write the next version of F.A.T.A.L if I wanted to, and it would not be censored. The government wouldn't stop me from publishing a work.<br/><br/>As a customer, I am also free to support or badmouth any product based on any basis. If I hate the colour yellow, I can insult all games with yellow covers. Also, no censorship.  I can pump ungodly amounts of money into blue-cover books if I want to.<br/><br/>As a fellow publisher, I can also be pissed off if someone else's work alienates a group of potential customers and dissuades them from joining gaming. If I was a designer focussing on family-friendly games to get more people into the hobby, I would be directly hurt if the latest marketing push was illustrated flyers of F.A.T.A.L the Roleplaying Game in the schools and community centres.<br/><br/>Art and speech has power. That's why governments have censored it in the past. That's also why I have to be cogniscent of what impact my own art and my own speech will have on individuals, on culture, on society, and on games. If I cause psychological harm to someone who has been traumautized or oppressed, it's my responsibility.

A lot of the time, and in a lot of situations, not just within design, I see a lot of people take commentary as a personal assault, and I think this can be a problem. <br/>Within group committees, for example, I have seen "It might be great if you guys could take a few things off my hands because I am quite busy at the minute" interpreted as "I do all the work and you lazy bums should get up and do something." There is clearly a communication problem here. In this case it is on the part of the receiver, but I have seen just as many of the part of the speaker too, where their intention to communicate criticism has felt worded as a personal attack on the individual, which naturally evokes a defensive response. In this respect, actually, psychological manuals on dealing with marital/relationship problems are ofte very good at teaching some basic communication lessons to avoid those pitfalls ('I feel...' rather than 'You are being...' is a particularly great piece of advice to make someone not feel under threat)<br/><br/>And then there are two levels of responsibility, that of the designer and that of the GM/facilitor/organiser.<br/>For example, if you pitch a game of Dog Eat Dog and everyone at the table goes 'Cool!', it is pretty clear they are OK with exploring issues of racism and colonialism etc.<br/>If you pitch a game of Spirit of the Century and then delve into the racial politics of 1920s withut prior warning, even if you do it respectfully and really well, that might not really be what the payers signed up for, and thats OK. Not every game has to explore issues to be fun (I'm sure we all know this I just wanted to make sure that it was stated).<br/>In regards to that the GM and players have a responsibility to create good art with the tools they have been given. If there are bits that folks at the table find problematic, then leaving or pulling them out is really what veils and 'X Cards' were invented for and everyone at the table has an obligation to accept that. <br/><br/>From a design level, the designer has a responsibility just to think about what they are writing (If, we assume, they are wanting to be progressive and not offensive, though they actually have all right to air their personal views about whatever). Often discussing these issues, asking for cultural advice and information from those heavily involved within that culture, doing some good old school book research and thinking critically about your sources can avoid pitfalls with regards to race. And if you do slip up? Accept it, take it on board, and consider if the commentary is valid on a very deep level. Deconstruct it, examine it. You will probably find it is and it is an unintentional misstep.<br/><br/>Again it all comes down to communication. We live in a culture at the minute where people like to throw around a lot of -ists at people, but in doing so we judge and label them, perhaps inappropriately. Not everybody who makes a comment that is racist is a racist and for the most part, they often don't realise that what they have said is offensive and can be terribly embarrassed when they realise it is. A very good example of this is the term 'Half-caste' in the UK. A lot of, especially our older population, don't realise that this term might offend the people they refer to with it because that was just the used term they were brought up around. Indeed, they probably grew up using it to refer to friends in the 1960s. That doesn't make the term not offensive, but it doesn't make the speaker racist, just unaware of the intent it now implies. On a broader scale this can apply to exotification and stereotyping which are a bit more insidious are easily missed/harder to avoid, especially with cultures individuals have had little interaction with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/untimately" title="untimately"><img alt="untimately" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/085/n2DMX2JRS72SF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/untimately">untimately</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418701/#Comment_418701" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-19T17:06:23+00:00" title="July 19, 2013  5:06PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 19, 2013 5:27PM by untimately.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JDCorley wrote:\n<blockquote>so that others would see it on their shelf or in their collection and see it as legitimate</blockquote>\nSeeing a book on someone's shelf and assuming that says anything about their attitude to the book, or whether they think any of the positions espoused by the book have value, is unreasonable.<br/><br/>I do not, in fact, stand with most of the books on my shelf. Aristotle talks about slavery as natural. I have some left wing books that promote armed insurrection and violence against property holders. I have a shelf full of economics books that advocate the various extreme postions of a number of different ideologies. I read books because they are influential, important, or eloquent much more frequently than because I agree with them. Even (especially?) fiction. American Psycho is on my shelf. Bret Eason Ellis is even one of my favorite writers. That doesn't mean that I enjoy (or see as legitimate, whatever that might mean) every paragraph of that book. Yukio Mishima, who was an unrepentant Japanese imperialist. Etc.<br/><br/>The same thing is true of RPG texts. I have 4E D&amp;D on my shelves, and though it does have a few interesting ideas in it, I hope no one would get the idea that I approve of the overall design just because I own it.<br/><br/>Even World of Darkness Gypsies (which I've never read, so I'm not sure why it's being called out) could be on someone's shelf because they want to show someone else how ridiculous it is. Or maybe they're writing a history of RPGs in the 90s. Or maybe a relative did art for it.<br/><br/>If you see a book on someone's shelf, you shouldn't take much away from that without more context. The books on your shelves are not identity markers or ways to stake out a position.

I think there's a difference between Aristotle on my philosophy shelf and WoD: Gypsies on my gaming shelf.  I guess it would be the same if I invited people over for a "philosophical debate about slavery club" and they saw it?  IDK, it seems off base.   And what is all that stuff about porn? I hope you all work that out without me, I got lost.<br/><br/>ANYWAY, this post is about work that I've done in order to improve my campaigns with respect to various issues.  Hopefully you will find these techniques/contexts helpful.  Please note that these are not universally good ideas. In fact some of them may be bad ideas for particular groups in particular contexts and I will try to give some detail about what you're giving up or what you risk by trying it.  But I think they show the diversity of how many different options there are to handling these types of situations in your gaming. <br/><br/>Again, I'm only going to be talking about practical, real-talk things I've done in actual historical RPG play that have helped me adjust things to keep players not just comfortable, but excited and engaged when the nastier parts of history reared their heads:<br/><br/><b>Reduce the in-characterness of certain dialogue.</b>  (Alternately: <b>Increase Ironic Distance</b>)  This is actually a much longer continuum than many immediately think. <br/><br/>At one end you are essentially LARPing the dialogue, using facial expressions and body language and saying exactly what the character says.  (This is one of the biggest advantages of LARP actually, the physicality of your performance and the immediacy of your words and expressions.)<br/><br/>At the other end, you are saying, generally, what the character says, without reciting their actual words, and your own demeanor is unquestionably not the same as the character's demeanor.  (This is also useful to get inconsequential discussions and conversations out of the way, but those are probably not going to give you problems no matter what you do.)<br/><br/>In between you have all the various aspects of performance: do you take on the tenor of the character's voice? Does your face have the expression of the character? Do you look at the person the character is looking at?<br/><br/>And all the various aspects of description: Do you use direct language or metaphor? Do you summarize or go into detail? Are the details sense-oriented or intellectualized?<br/><br/>Give some thought to how you're going to get across things like slurs and intimidating expressions without if you decide not to say/perform them yourself.  There are effective ways to do this.  Say this out loud, quietly:  <br/><br/>"He sneers at you. <br/><br/>He calls you 'boy'. <br/><br/>He calls you worse." <br/><br/>That's a hard hit, even including a racial slur (in the fictional world, two or more slurs) but there's no question that you are not adopting the character's point of view.  That character never gets closer than arm's length.  You could even put him farther than arm's length if you change your tone of voice to mocking the dude. Of course he's saying those things, he's clearly an asshole.  Being able to communicate a character like this is a matter of preparation.  You are not going to just improvise that on the spot.<br/><br/>Sometimes you're not going to be brilliant.  The above could just be "He sneers at you, calls you the n-word in a voice of contempt."  That's fine, it gets the job done, nobody is going to be disappointed in you for saying that.<br/><br/>This is NOT just a GM thing.  Players can also do this.  "MyCharacter dismisses your opinion and says something about your 'womanly predilections'."  is an effective description of dialogue, and it can be delivered with an expression and demeanor that makes it clear that player isn't dismissing player and is in fact lobbing up a softball to the other player ready to get crushed.<br/><br/>Power relations can be conveyed in different ways too.  Don't pound the table yourself, say "He pounds the table with his fist."  Don't be standing when a player is sitting if a character is getting aggressive, instead, describe their posture and menacing expression. <br/><br/>For someone like me, living in a society set up from one end to the other so that names will really never hurt me, it's easy for me to forget that words can be really, really devastating, even in an imaginary situation.<br/><br/>Even outside of character depiction, I think it's also important to consider descriptions of a situation.  In an Old West game, a fictional crowd of people approaching the characters with torches and a noose is very likely to have a different impact on a white player than on a black player, no matter what type of character they're playing.  I'd be a churl and a fool not to know this.  (I have been a churl and a fool with respect to other things involving a black player in a historical RPG, including one I'll talk about a little later, but not this particular one.)<br/><br/>The downside of easing back on the portrayal of horrible characters and situations should be obvious.  You do lose the immediacy and the power of direct dialogue.  You do lose the rush of performance and the spotlight is diminished when you do it.  You don't give up nothing by doing this.  You're leaving some tools in your toolbox.  <br/><br/>But think of your gaming toolbox not in terms of "this game is going to be the best game that <i>anyone has ever had in the history of roleplaying</i>"...instead, think of it in terms of "this game is going to be the best game <i>these people</i> could have <i>tonight</i>."  There really is no Platonic ideal of a roleplaying game session, perfect in every way, and every group strives ever closer to that one type of perfection.  Because we are all collaborators (no matter what the goal of the collaboration is, be it a cohesive plotline, a solid strategy or historical immersion), it does you no good to kick the struts out from underneath what your fellow players can bring to the table.  You and they should go for absolutely everything you can go for in striving for the best game possible, hell, even risk getting hurt if you're up for that and something good might come from it.  But you have got to know where the line is, and the one who might get hurt is the one who gets to set where it is.<br/><br/>Real-talk example from an Old West-ish game: My wife (paraphrased): "JD, you can have characters say or do whatever they want, hell, stand up and yell what they say straight in my face if you want, <i>I know you are harmless.</i>"  This doesn't make my wife a special snowflake in some way - she couldn't possibly give this permission on behalf of another person in a game of mine, and she couldn't possibly give it to a stranger at a convention game.  But it means she, because of her experiences and relationships, doesn't feel the risk, or suffer the hurt, in the way someone else might, sitting at the table while I half-spit about "whores and jezebels" and, wild-eyed, describe the firelight on a Bowie knife.  She wouldn't be able to stop laughing with delight.<br/><br/>You don't need to pre-clear every single word you say or every situation or every character depiction, that's ludicrous.  But at least question it - and for god's sake, listen to the answers.  If the person you're talking to says "No, I am <i>into</i> this. I want you to really go for it." give them a high five and do a dance if you want, but don't take that as permission to do it with every player in every game forever.<br/><br/>(cont)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418711/#Comment_418711" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-20T00:33:53+00:00" title="July 20, 2013 12:33AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 20, 2013 12:35AM by JDCorley.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't yet talked about content. I think plenty of people know about lines and veils and X-cards and such.  Maybe a quick nod to them is  enough.  Or maybe we need more.

Aristotle talks about slavery as natural. I have some left wing books that promote armed insurrection and violence against property holders. I have a shelf full of economics books that advocate the various extreme postions of a number of different ideologies. I read books because they are influential, important, or eloquent much more frequently than because I agree with them. Even (especially?) fiction. American Psycho is on my shelf. Bret Eason Ellis is even one of my favorite writers. That doesn't mean that I enjoy (or see as legitimate, whatever that might mean) every paragraph of that book. Yukio Mishima, who was an unrepentant Japanese imperialist. Etc.<br/><br/>The same thing is true of RPG texts. I have 4E D&amp;D on my shelves, and though it does have a few interesting ideas in it, I hope no one would get the idea that I approve of the overall design just because I own it.<br/><br/>Even World of Darkness Gypsies (which I've never read, so I'm not sure why it's being called out) could be on someone's shelf because they want to show someone else how ridiculous it is. Or maybe they're writing a history of RPGs in the 90s. Or maybe a relative did art for it.<br/><br/>If you see a book on someone's shelf, you shouldn't take much away from that without more context. The books on your shelves are not identity markers or ways to stake out a position. They are information containers.</blockquote>\nThis is actually a really interesting point that I hadn't considered. I rather think I agree with this. It's perfectly possible (and actually a lot more mature) for someone to hold views, beliefs, and values, and to own/read books of all stripes, including ones that clash against those values violently. The human mind isn't apt to be "infected" by opposing views, but rather strengthened by knowing what those views are, and what the thoughts of those who hold them are.<br/><br/>To that view, you might even say that judging someone by their bookshelf is superficial, because you're presuming that they're using their bookshelf as a showcase of what they believe. This would only be true in two circumstances... A: you never read your books, and use them as wall decoration or B: you only read books which don't contain anything contrary to your beliefs and values. (Well, I guess also C: you hide away books that don't agree with your beliefs and values, because you don't feel like you could adequately explain yourself...) None of those, now that I consider it, really cast a nice light on things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418733">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonT" title="JasonT"><img alt="JasonT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonT">JasonT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418733/#Comment_418733" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-20T13:45:43+00:00" title="July 20, 2013  1:45PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 20, 2013 1:48PM by JasonT.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I feel like there is still a bit of some confusion here around the concept of "hurt" as an abstract concept, so I'd like to suggest a way to make this more concrete.<br/><br/>As Felan says, you can use art to attack \u2013\xa0to wear away at ideas and norms that systematically rob people of the right to be treated with dignity and justice. But, of course, you can use art to attack ideas <i>without actually hurting people.</i> Actually, that's one of the great things about communication: It's a lot easier to turn enemies into friends with words than with weapons.<br/><br/>In addition, we can also talk about "hurt" in terms of <i>real harm to actual people.</i> And even though we don't necessarily mean physical harm, that harm is still no less real; it's <i>not</i> the same thing as "getting offended" (though of course feelings of offense are another potential result of communication). When we talk about how art has the capacity to hurt people, what we mean is that words and images quite literally have the power to evoke disturbing memories, feelings of helplessness, and genuine anguish. <br/><br/>One of the most concrete explanations I've ever read on how words can hurt on such a personal level was in <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/features/9766-The-R-Word" rel="nofollow">a piece on The Escapist</a> about casual use of "the R-word" in gaming trash talk (MAJOR TRIGGER WARNING for child abuse, sexual violence, and other awful things that had to be said in that piece). The author writes: "Imagine if someone captured your flag or dominated you in deathmatch, then rubbed in your face how your sister was killed by a drunk driver or your dad abandoned you when you were little. That's how close it cuts. People keep using the word 'offended,' in this discussion -- I'm not offended, I'm hurt. Hearing this word causes me emotional pain."<br/><br/>Having suffered a life-altering trauma is arguably different from belonging to a cultural group that has been suffered years of degrading stereotypes. I can't say that either apply to me (or at least the stereotypes applied to my own cultural groups have never gotten me arrested, or passed over for a job, or tailed on the way home by vigilantes). But I can see how being reminded of either one wouldn't just be offensive \u2013\xa0it would hurt.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418742/#Comment_418742" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-20T23:45:26+00:00" title="July 20, 2013 11:45PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 20, 2013 11:52PM by zircher.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>So, creating art can hurt people and you are responsible for that hurt.

And as such, I'm comfortable with that.  <br/><br/>I reject the blanket notion that we are by default responsible for the hurt that our art can produce.  Sure, people can create hurtful things.  They can do it to be shocking, to promote discussion, to open people's eyes to a different perspective, or take them out of their comfort zone.  But, those are deliberate decisions by the creator and they chose to bear that burden.<br/><br/>The whole premise smells of people that for some odd reason think they need to be victims or something.  [Yes, there are real victims for all kinds of bad things out there.  I'm not addressing that group.  I'm talking to a bunch of clever/creative people with the time and resources to have this manner of discussion on an internet site.]<br/><br/>For example; If I make a war game, I have a specific audience in mind that would appreciate that.  I'm not going out of my way to create something hurtful and inflict it on people.   I would not expect my project to please a pacifist.  If they chose to read it, I would not feel responsible for their hurt since they made the active choice to expose themselves to a genre they do not approve of.  If anything, I applaud them for going outside of their comfort zone.<br/><br/>I strongly disagree on flippancy and cynicism as being useless.  They are tools to communicate, they can express some very human values.  They can deflect a line of thought or they can convey disapproval of the concept/subject without being belligerent.  Additionally, some folks might find it amusing and there is value in that.  <br/><br/>Speaking <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is</span> dangerous.  And, there are people I may be poisoning the well with in this community, but I honestly believe this thread needed to be lighter in tone and my previous post is how I chose to express that.  My apologies if that required too much analysis for what was intended to be a humorous interlude in a more serious discussion.<br/>--<br/>TAZ                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418743">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418743/#Comment_418743" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-21T00:00:24+00:00" title="July 21, 2013 12:00AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 21, 2013 12:00AM by JDCorley.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Sure, people can create hurtful things.

But as someone points out you can hurt people without meaning to. These are some things that I've learned over the years to try to ameliorate or avoid those situations, and the things I've learned you sometimes lose with those strategies.  I'm a fan of many period pulp mysteries and other material that often is stereotyped and bigoted, or at least exploitive.  And the excitement and positive features of that material is attractive to me as a creator of RPG play.  So I think about these issues a lot. I don't know much about Macho Women With Guns, but if it's got good things about the approach, I don't think just because it's exploitive or silly that it should be discounted. A lot of times comedy can show us the way when action/adventure or drama falls down.
