But this post is like 10 years in the making.  <br/><br/>Once upon a time, in the 3e era, I was a regular at EN World, posting as rycanada.  <br/><br/>I really enjoyed the endless supply of feats and monsters and magic items that the forum gave me.  I found them easy to use and those kind of things were digestible enough morsels that I could daydream between classes or between profit &amp; loss reports and still have one foot in the gaming world all day.  I felt like it was everyone giving to everyone, and that might have been my illusion but to me that EN World went away.  <br/><br/>I went back a few times to check, but the EN World I wanted was hidden under dozens of other things that turned me off.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
