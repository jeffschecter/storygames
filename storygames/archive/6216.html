I got hooked on the awesome comics, and then read a good bit of the books.<br/><br/>But that was years ago. Is FaGM all nostalgia?<br/><br/>What would you bring to the table if you played Fafhrd and Grey Mouser? All answers are welcome, from "I'd play Fafhrd himself using this system" to "Strip them out and keep Lankhmar", to "Here are the story elements that were common, I'd bring this to the game"<br/><br/>What stories would you have me re-read? What're the best of the lot? I don't want to re-read it all.<br/><br/>Basically, I want to test out my nostalgia to see if it's more than just memories of the past and see what kind of at the table experience would be fun.<br/><br/>My primary idea for the system is In A Wicked Age, if it matters.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_137959">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue" title="Rob Donoghue"><img alt="Rob Donoghue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.logrus.com/~moose/tinyhat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue">Rob Donoghue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137959/#Comment_137959" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-03T14:11:58+00:00" title="April  3, 2008  2:11PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A) No, it really is that awesome.

I had read the Mignola comics &amp; liked them, but wanted to read the books.<br/><br/>But I don't really have any advice for you, Mark - I know you well enough to know that all you'll have to do is reread and you'll do just fine adapting it to IaWA or another system. <br/><br/>Good Luck!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138009">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20Bow" title="Justin Bow"><img alt="Justin Bow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20Bow">Justin Bow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138009/#Comment_138009" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-03T16:08:12+00:00" title="April  3, 2008  4:08PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, you're lucky, Dave. That first Fafhrd and the Mouser book is by far the weakest, in my opinion. Now you have an unending stretch of awesome in front of you. <br/><br/>The two best stories from the entire series are, in my opinion, Bazaar of the Bizarre and Lean Times in Lankhmar. <br/><br/>I tend to shy away from trying to emulate pre-existing material with a game, because you will ultimately fail. I mean, I don't know anyone who can be as witty and awesome as Fritz Lieber on demand. <br/>That said, if you use Lankhmar and its world as a background and a very rules-light pulpy system or IaWA, you could certainly get a feel similar to the books.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138027">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138027/#Comment_138027" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-03T17:35:55+00:00" title="April  3, 2008  5:35PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, so, different spin:<br/><br/>What changes to the Oracle would you make to make it more Lankhmar-y?
