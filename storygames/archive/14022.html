While it's necessary to have human goals for most things in DW (as in AW), not everything does. It was nice to be able to cut loose with some faceless bad guys (one of whom, the Storm giant's son, got filled in as the game went along).<br/><br/><i>If you've played Dungeon World, did monsters feel interesting to face?</i><br/> I've played DW and I like the combat. It's nice that I can be overmatched one-on-one with a character. Straight monster battles are interesting because of the Hard Moves on failures, and the variouos complications that come. I do wish the Positioning rules were still in the PDF, though. Those were really cool.<br/><br/><i>If you've also run or played Apocalypse World, could you compare your experiences? In particular, do you run DW combat the same as AW combat? </i><br/>I've run both. NPCs in AW are really easy to push around, even if you don't have a Gunlugger or a wickedly social playbook in play. Generally NPCs take one hit and they're out. In DW you get to have a much more detailed combat, with moves, actions and reactions. It was much easier for me to see where Moves Snowball in combat in DW, as in AW combat usually only lasted a round or two before it's resolved.<br/><br/>Further, the EXPLICIT damage-back on Hack N' Slash makes things like maneuvering for advantage VERY useful. It also makes Defend cool, because you can insert yourself into that equation and take some pressure off characters with less HP and armor. However, damage-back along with MC moves can make players feel overwhelmed and like I'm getting tons of hits.<br/><br/>I used a combat clock in the Radithor game, and it made that fight really come alive. The maneuvering stages set the tone for the combat, with me reacting to their moves and filling out the stage the combat would occur on. This could have been improved by having specific things they could do in the maneuvering stage to gain advantage (or give advantage if they weren't addressed) instead of just saying 'survive these three rounds and you win'.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_317583">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317583/#Comment_317583" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-23T10:40:59+00:00" title="March 23, 2011 10:40AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, what happened to Pull A Stunt and Positioning?

In this week's game I fudged an outcome because the PCs were overmatched - the monsters by rights should have just killed everyone, fair's fair, but I had them drag a dude off to their cave and also lowered their hit points by 30%. If they had been more than just faceless monsters they would have had a good reason to not kill every damn thing, maybe.<br/><br/>I will <i>definitely </i>echo Remi's "moves snowball" comment, which is a little opaque in AW but very easy to see in play in DW.

In the rules it says that you should err on the side of giving monsters too few hitpoints, and I feel like this should be a hard-and-fast rule as opposed to a suggestion.

I was releived whenever the PCs didn't encounter them. I think that was because combat felt borning with that group. I think in future I'd have the kobolds just be so cowed by the adventurers (who already beat them up once), that the encounter wouldn't be a combat. Either I'd have the Kobolds flee, or have them gang up in such numbers that it wouldn't be one-sided enough to call it combat. Combat feeling boring is a flag to me that a fight isn't what's really happening. This holds true in AW as well.<br/><br/>If you've played Dungeon World, did monsters feel interesting to face?<br/><br/>I guess I'll find out tonight!<br/><br/>If you've also run or played Apocalypse World, could you compare your experiences? In particular, do you run DW combat the same as AW combat? <br/><br/>I tend to run them the same way - that is they are just the same rules extended into a certain kind of situation. I avoid extended firefights in AW because I want to see the results, not spend a lot of time of fight. Maybe that's a syle thing.<br/><br/>I have seen DW monsters beat the hell out of a party pretty handily. It's important to have a good option for failure when that happens. That's why monsters need to be human (though sometimes a monster just wants to eat). Other times the monsters are easily beaten up. I think that's OK. There's a D&amp;D thing where things are going great until suddenly they are going very badly indeeed.<br/><br/>Humanoid monsters capable of acting in a concerted organized fashion are potentially very interesting and very scary for the PCs. The first time the orcs form a shield wall and advance at a slow march, the PCs are going to have to think outside the box pretty quickly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_317616">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317616/#Comment_317616" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-23T15:36:02+00:00" title="March 23, 2011  3:36PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for all the thoughts so far!<br/><br/>Combat as Exploration - yes, that's the way I think it should feel (probably because that's how you ran it, Tony). The text should probably more directly reflect that.<br/><br/>Combat clocks - that's really interesting. I haven't used them much in AW, so they haven't been (explicitly) brought over to DW, but that's something we need to look at.<br/><br/>Positioning - The positioning moves went away because the move now called Dodge (we've talked a bit about renaming it) covers that, in my opinion. The latest version was pushed out to match some con play, so we haven't caught all the dangling references. Dodge is like Act Under Fire, the catch all move for when you're doing something in dangerous circumstances. Position started to look a lot like Dodge, so it seemed simpler to keep one move. <br/><br/>HP - HP has proved really, really hard to nail down. I've had the opposite experience from Jason - a 35 HP monster laid low with little show by 2nd level characters. I was actually worried 70 wouldn't be enough for that level. My design goal for "solo" monsters, the kind that you build an encounter around, is three successful moves from characters of the same level brings them down. The issue has been figuring out what "three moves worth of damage" means in play, for different groups.<br/><br/>Intelligent Monsters and Set Pieces - Talking about monster motivations, set pieces, and intelligent monsters just gave me a brain wave.

(rolls a 7 and receives damage from the goblin).<br/>DM: You lunge and pierce his ragged green thigh causing him to yelp out in pain while he follows through with the swing of his axe which glances off your bicep.  <br/>Joe: Ow.<br/>DM: You both recover, grimacing as the goblin lunges towards you with a wild swing.  Roll dodge.<br/><br/>Or would Joe just get to act again.  Basically, monsters attack either by PCs moves failing AND by forcing a Dodge when the monsters are proactive.

I haven't played AW since it's beta about 2 years ago so that could be why I'm a little confused.<br/><br/>In combat, if a monster attacks a PC, does the PC roll Dodge or does the PC just take damage?<br/><br/>Does combat go like this:<br/>Joe: I'm attacking the goblin with my spear! (rolls a 7 and receives damage from the goblin).<br/>DM: You lunge and pierce his ragged green thigh causing him to yelp out in pain while he follows through with the swing of his axe which glances off your bicep.<br/>Joe: Ow.<br/>DM: You both recover, grimacing as the goblin lunges towards you with a wild swing.  Roll dodge.<br/><br/>Or would Joe just get to act again.  Basically, monsters attack either by PCs moves failing AND by forcing a Dodge when the monsters are proactive.  Or is it one or the other but not both?</blockquote>\nI like to think of Act Under Fire (Dodge, whatever) as covering danger that's not already covered by the move being made. So, if Joe's Hack and Slashing, then he probably doesn't need to Act Under Fire - the move pretty explicitly says it's when you're in melee combat with someone, so the goblin's already fictionally represented. Now, if there was also a hail of arrows from unseen archers raining down, or if Joe was fighting on the crumbling slopes of an ancient ice mountain, he'd probably Act Under Fire as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_317688">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317688/#Comment_317688" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-24T10:04:05+00:00" title="March 24, 2011 10:04AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As far as renaming, no use keeping it a secret: Adam and I were thinking of calling our Act Under Fire move (currently called Dodge) Defy Danger, and call our Harm Move (currently called Defy Danger) Saving Throw.

Outside of combat this game plays just as sweet as AW, and in some ways better (eg: detail that comes with the history is cool). But I've been thinking about the issue of combat lately as it is a sticking point for me.<br/><br/><i>If you've run Dungeon World, did monsters feel useful?</i><br/><i>If you've played Dungeon World, did monsters feel interesting to face?</i><br/><br/>Not really. More like they were punching bags for the PCs, in the same way that they can do in D&amp;D. Especially as you go up levels, the fights seem to drag for me.<br/><br/><i>If you've also run or played Apocalypse World, could you compare your experiences? In particular, do you run DW combat the same as AW combat?</i><br/><br/>My 20+ years of D&amp;D make me (and my players) want to run a fantasy combat in rounds and turns and but when I do this combat feels like a poor version of D&amp;D and you have to get past the monsters multiple hits. When try to I run combat more like AW I feel some of the key rules like variable damage and hit points take out the tension that AW has where two hits could kill you. I also find balancing the monsters hard.<br/><br/>I've posted alternatives that suit what I want on the Barf Forth thread before (like not escalating HP with levels), but I think these are too radical to keep your core audience. Fundamentally I wonder it I have too much D&amp;D baggage to play DW as written. I can see it is a well written game, but I'd rather play AW, World of Conan or Saga of the Icelanders because for me play is faster and easier and I can push past any baggage. I gave up on D&amp;D 4e for similar reasons.<br/><br/>Why am I posting if I may not be a future player? You probably want to cover the wants of as many people as possible. But I'd caution you based on my experience from being pulled to much by individual's views as I think other people will have substantial baggage with fantasy games.<br/><br/>Overall, I think combat has improved over all the versions I have seen and is getting closer to what your core audience will want.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_317753">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317753/#Comment_317753" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-25T05:17:47+00:00" title="March 25, 2011  5:17AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Those are valid Justin.

Since her timing was inconvenient...I sniped her down in the street from a 7th story window.  Following AW's very clear rules on the matter...Seth gamely killed off his super badass NPC before he even got a chance to demonstrate how super badass she was.

I think, not surprisingly, I like the AW parts better and I'm trying to figure out if the D&amp;D parts still work for the kinds of play I'm interested in.  4E doesn't work for me much at all, mostly because fights are boring, and the only real "kill and loot" play I've enjoyed is Castle Ravenloft.  Then again, like you, I just may not be the right audience for some parts of DW, and, while it may be the best dungeon-y game around, no game can be all things to all people.<br><br>But, if we wait around long enough, they'll probably be other DW hacks -- like how DW is a hack of ApocD&amp;D <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br><br>EDIT: I also still haven't played it yet, despite having Sage close by, so who knows.

I'm particularly fond of looking at HP (both player and monster) as a bit of a countdown in combat.  As you lose HP (as a PC) you move from the "Easy Win" phase of the game to the "Maybe We Might Not Win" part - the fun part of combat where you're hanging on by the skin of your teeth and expending your magic items to survive.  I personally prefer combat to be mostly this part.  The part where you're not sure of the outcome.  So, we're looking at how to make the game's combat embrace that.<br><br>For me (and obviously Sage has similar goals but might phrase this differently) Dungeon World is an attempt to marry the games I love most.  To take the themes and play styles of old-school D&amp;D and marry them with the simple, effective mechanics of AW.  It's been an interesting hybridization so far.  Imagining DW to be too much like AW is dangerous and can lead to unsatisfying play.  The same can be said for imagining it is too much like D&amp;D.<br/><br/>Ergo, the tweaking.

(My Maestro D' dived from our broken truck onto the passing bike and other such desperate acts and I was seriously worried she'd die several times even though she stayed at 3 o'clock for the whole fight.) This got me thinking about all the games of DW I'd played and the 12 or so people I've played with and why our combat was not this good.<br/><br/>My experience from DW combats is that there were more "desperate moments" and interesting twists where the player was less experienced with RPGs (especially the 8-10 year olds I played with who pushed completely different buttons during combat) and at lower levels where the chance of death from a single hit was higher. In addition I think that the players who were most disappointed were those:<br/>- that were extremely dissatisfied with D&amp;D 4e but love AW and chaffed at the D&amp;D elements (eg: me); or<br/>- were pretty happy with D&amp;D 4e and had never played or were not as interested in AW.<br/><br/>I'd say my experience backs up Adam's comment that if you imagine (or want) DW to be too D&amp;D or too AW it won't work as well. In hindsight I'd make it much clearer going into a game of DW that this is not AW or D&amp;D but a mix of the two (as it says in the intro). It also occurs to me that the two groups above may be the hardest in general to please with DW - this is part of what I mean by "baggage" in my other posts.<br/><br/>Re-reading my posts above it also sounds like I'm pretty down on DW. Just wanted to say that while we are not enjoying that one aspect of DW (combat) enough for it to be our regular game of choice I'll still be playing occasionally with the older kids in the extended family as it is performing great as a introductory game and I'd still recommend it to people (but probably not those in those two groups).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_317914">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317914/#Comment_317914" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-27T10:03:20+00:00" title="March 27, 2011 10:03AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wightbred</cite><br/><br/>Re-reading my posts above it also sounds like I'm pretty down on DW.

To get some idea of where I'm coming from when I think about design for DW - I'm playing a regular, weekly 4e game that's all tactics and dice and squares and optimal whatever and I'm running a game of AW bi-weekly, which is where I get all my new-school goodness.  Dungeon World is my way to bridge that gap - to bring back that swords-and-mayhem storytelling style to D&amp;D and to bring "the Fighter hits the Orc with his +5 sword" to AW.  <br/><br/>I think, too, that if people see DW as a way to help their old-school D&amp;D players try out something a little more "indie" and help their indie groups have a little hack-and-slash fun then I've done my job.  Or at least, that's the premise we're trying to deliver on with DW.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_317933">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317933/#Comment_317933" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-27T19:27:40+00:00" title="March 27, 2011  7:27PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm late, but Defy Danger and Saving Throw are awesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_317962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317962/#Comment_317962" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-28T08:43:14+00:00" title="March 28, 2011  8:43AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ry, thanks and welcome to the party.

All the interesting options for consequences and dealing with them were in the older versions of the moves, now they feel like they just offer the same boring "do you hit or not?" question that old-school D&amp;D offers. <br/><br/>As for the questions, Tony's been good about making monsters feel interesting to face when he's run Dungeon World for me, and I also found monsters "useful" when I ran his Purple Worm Graveyard for some friends over Christmastime.

The problem with Pull a Stunt was that it didn't cleanly map a fictional action to fictional/mechanical effects. It covered a huge fictional range (basically, anything in combat that wasn't another move) and tried to make you choose the effects for that from a list. It really broke down when, say, someone wants to step out of the Underking's attack at just the right moment to get him to accidentally destroy the Banner of Al-Kharm. With Pull a Stunt, you could succeed and then have to choose some completely unrelated effects - stuff like dealing damage to him (nice bonus) or getting into a good position (another nice side effect). But none of those actually helped you make the outcome of the thing you were actually doing interesting.<br/><br/>So now that same action would be covered by Defy Danger (the newly named one, the Act Under Fire equivalent), which doesn't try to make you choose off a menu to describe what your action means. Since it covers such a range of actions, this is a lot better. On a 10+, yeah, you make him strike the ancient banner, summoning the curse or whatever. On a 7-9: choices! Good choices, from the GM, who can make them up in the moment. No more does the poor designer have to guess at every possible reason you might be doing something other than attacking in combat.<br/><br/>Hack and Slash could use some more work, and we're aware of that, but even as it stands I contend it's not bad. For the classes where Hack and Slash is a bigger deal, they get more options attached to it. Damage is also a more interesting consequence, since damage leads to (depending the on the amount and origin): the Saving Throw/Harm move, cast a spell (to heal), Defend (to make sure you don't get hit again). It's not D&amp;D where damage means you erase a number, then the cleric erases a spell, then you go back to the original number. Moves snowball.<br/><br/>Earlier versions of Hack and Slash had a couple of issues, I think. First, they didn't have as clear a fictional mapping of actions. You could say "I swing my axe at the goblin!" and then choose options that say "Oh, and I actually hit the other goblin too, and moved around behind them." It was a little messy when it came to "To Do It, Do It." You could describe just enough to get the roll, then get a lot of effects that didn't seem similar at all to what you described.<br/><br/>There was also some bogging down, in that every roll was choices choices choices. It turned one of the most common actions in the game into a bit more back-and-forth than was really needed.<br/><br/>So now Hack and Slash is a little less interesting, but smoother in play, and it effectively maps a clear fictional action (a melee attack) to clear fictional/mechanical outcomes (dealing and taking various amounts of damage). It's not the most interesting move, but the problem is that very interesting moves tend to wear out over time. Too many choices, or making choices that are too big, tend to make moves wear thin.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_318019">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318019/#Comment_318019" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-28T17:51:43+00:00" title="March 28, 2011  5:51PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>I think the combat in the games of DW I've run could be characterized as "a series of desperate moments."

How does he or she direct the action and players to create this in-the-moment style?

Stuff like "So you're ignoring the goblin behind you to focus on the orc? Is anyone taking care of that goblin?" or "Now that the paladin's pushed the orc away, you've got some time to cast a spell. Or did you want to do something else?"<br/><br/>Have enemies come after them. I think I mentally kind of take turns for my monsters more than for the players. It's all about fictional timing. The bonecaster hasn't done anything for a while, what's he up to? Who's he attacking? I figure that out, announce what's going on ("The bonecaster's chanting something over those oddly-preserved skeletons...") then see what they're doing about it. This can easily snowball into following the action, since if they pay attention to the new threat, they might be ignoring an old one (or they might create opportunities for each other).<br/><br/>The bigger thing, and this is more on the design side, is having monsters that provoke the players. Not in an angry way, but just monsters that demand a response. Ideally, DW will have these. Even more ideally, we'll have some advice on making your own.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, and of course addressing the characters, not the players. You and I can talk about the goblin's sneak attack, but your character just hears a warbling high pitched battle cry and then a poisoned dagger in his ribs.

My bigger concern (and something that I'm getting ideas on) is making it more interesting for the Fighter, Paladin, etc. Especially the 7-9 result: it's clearly a partial success (trading damage) but doesn't give you anything interesting to say or do. 10+ at least has a choice for you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_318078">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318078/#Comment_318078" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-29T12:29:54+00:00" title="March 29, 2011 12:29PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 29, 2011 12:30PM by J_Walton.">edited March 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another thing to think about: some of the most creative and interesting stuff in AW isn't always mechanically backed by a move.

Or did you want to do something else?"<br/><br/>Have enemies come after them. I think I mentally kind of take turns for my monsters more than for the players. It's all about fictional timing. The bonecaster hasn't done anything for a while, what's he up to? Who's he attacking? I figure that out, announce what's going on ("The bonecaster's chanting something over those oddly-preserved skeletons...") then see what they're doing about it. This can easily snowball into following the action, since if they pay attention to the new threat, they might be ignoring an old one (or they might create opportunities for each other).</blockquote>\nI have no idea how I would do that without feeling like I was cheating/fudging/whatever.  Can you unpack a bit more how you don't do strict turn-based combat but still make it feel fair (on a mechanical level\u2014perhaps "honest" is a better word for what I mean)?<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_318177">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318177/#Comment_318177" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-30T11:06:52+00:00" title="March 30, 2011 11:06AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, Dungeon World is still Apocalypse World, right? So you follow the fiction. <br/><br/>There's still taking turns as in "you say something, then I say something," there just isn't an initiative order or move speeds or something. Combat isn't really a shifting of gears like in D&amp;D, it's just a continuation of the describe/move cycle.<br/><br/>So, maybe an example:<br/><br/>John, playing Narb the Thief, says "Okay, I walk down the hallway towards the chanting." He hasn't used any abilities to know there's an ambush with two goblins waiting in the alcove, so I say "When you get to about this point (point to map) two sharp green daggers come at you in the hands of goblins. Looks like they were waiting for you! You take 4 damage."<br/><br/>Fictionally, I figure Narb is busy for a moment with the sudden goblin attack, so I turn to Paul, playing Bran, the Bard: "You were watching Narb's progress, right? Well two goblins just jumped out of this alcove, they're trying to drag him to the ground while stabbing him with daggers, what are you doing?"<br/><br/>Paul looks over his moves for a second, asks John how many HP Narb has left, and says "Things don't seem too bad yet, but I'm worried about those daggers, we know these goblins like to use poison. I've got some antitoxin in my Adventuring Kit, I'm going to toss that on the dagger, since I know it'll change color in the presence of poison, see if I can't figure out what it is."<br/><br/>I want to make sure I understand what he's doing, so I check: "Sounds like you're Spouting Lore, and using your Adventuring Kit for a bonus?" "Yeah" "You probably had to get a little closer to the fight to be able to toss the antitoxin, right?" "Oh yeah, sure, I think I'm nearly within reach of the goblins." "Okay, great, make your roll."<br/><br/>Paul fails his roll, so I make a move, and I decide to reveal an unwelcome truth: "You toss out the antitoxin, and it turns all kinds of weird colors, nothing you've seen before, kind of like an oil film. But the worst part is, some of the antitoxin splashes onto Narb, and it reacts there too. It looks like Narb might already be poisoned."<br/><br/>So we know what Narb and Bran are doing, what about Arras, the wizard? I turn to Shannon: "Everyone else is rushing down the hall, what are you doing?" "Jeez, getting us into more trouble already? I'm still worried about that hellhound tracking us, I'm using a spell to seal the door behind us. They can handle a couple of goblins, right?"<br/><br/>We handle that, roll the dice, the spell is cast, etc. Now I want to check in on that fight again, so I say "Those goblins are stabbing with abandon, trying to drag Narb down so they can really take him out. What are you guys doing?" Everyone has a chance to step up and say what they're doing, so long as it fictionally makes sense.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>In my experience with AW and DW, this has been fair, at least in the way that action scenes in a movie are fair (or honest, or whatever). The cinematography of a movie is probably a good comparison: we don't have to spend the exact same amount of time on each actor, we focus in on the action, spend a bit more time there, cut away, then come back when something interesting is happening again. It kind of relies on everyone being adults and knowing how to share and take turns without a strict order, but it's also kind of inherent in the move structure. Since a move is a clear fictional thing, we don't have to worry too much about how long it takes, or when the next move can happen. Someone just says they do something, the rules kick in to see how it turns out, and then we see what else was happening at the same time before moving on to what they do next.<br/><br/>I had the same response to AW combat at first, but now it feels kind of funny. It's like asking how you decide when things happen when writing a story: if I'm writing a fantasy novel, I don't figure out how long it takes to swing a sword, I just go with a bit of common sense, describe the action, then maybe but away to something else for a bit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_318214">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318214/#Comment_318214" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-30T14:17:46+00:00" title="March 30, 2011  2:17PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd tweak that first moment, if I was GM, Sage. "Suddenly you get stabbed! 4 HP." is a very hard move. I get to make a hard move when: 1) a player misses a roll, 2) my NPC's plan comes together without interference, or 3) I get handed the perfect opportunity.<br/><br/>I don't think an adventurer walking down a hallway is in fact the perfect opportunity for my goblin ambush. The thief can see and hear, is presumably being pretty careful, and is an experienced dungeon crawler. For it to be the *perfect* opportunity, it would need to be too dark to see, maybe with the chanting so loud the thief couldn't hear the sounds of goblins overhead, etc. Then -- if the thief says, yes, I do walk down the pitch dark hallway, towards the super-loud chanting -- yeah, I say, "You get stabbed! 4 hp."<br/><br/>But in the example, no, I don't get to just stab him. Instead:<br/><br/>"Two goblins drop from a hidden alcove overhead, knives flashing at your throat! What do you do?" That's nasty enough for an ambush. The thief's just been put in a really tough spot, his options are seriously constrained. But he gets the opportunity to do something (i.e. make a move). That's the fun bit.<br/><br/>Only very, very rarely should a hard move *start* a sequence of action.
