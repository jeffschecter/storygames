I was asking for some help, but have received complete silence so far.  So I'm going to try over here in Smallpressland to see if I can get some help, though I'm reworking the post for a new audience.<br/><br/>So the new World of Darkness, for those who are not familiar with it, has this core trait called Morality that measures characters' descent into the aforementioned darkness.  If characters perform certain acts listed for various levels of Mortality, they have to roll dice on a Morality Check to see if their morals have been weakened by succumbing to their darker urges.  In Changeling, this is replaced by a trait called Clarity that measures how close characters are to descending into madness and not being able to determine what's the Real World and what's the dark magical world of Faeries.  Basically, these mechanics do not really interest me at all.  I like moral ambiguity and <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>-style play where the GM (or, in this case, the rules of the game) doesn't decide what's right or wrong.<br/><br/>Additionally, the new World of Darkness has XP mechancs that are really arbitrary, with the GM awarding points for doing cool stuff and good roleplaying and the like.  Not my thing either.  Last of all, characters regain Willpower (a critical resource in any Storyteller game) by fulfilling either their Vice or their Virtue conditions (based on the 7 deadly sins and their corresponding virtues), which are kinda Key-like already, I suppose, but are too generally and not specific enough to really work for me.<br/><br/>Basically, I want to replace all that stuff with a lithe panther of an indie games personality mechanics engine.  I want to put a tiger in this tank.<br/><br/>Initially, I was thinking about directly incorporating an XP system based on Keys from <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i>. TSOY has both general Keys and what are basically ethnic or factional Keys which can be taken when a character is from a certain ethnic background or is a member of a certain faction or organization. This would work well in Changeling, I suspect, where certain XP conditions could be limited to various Courts or Seemings or the Nobility, the different factions of faerieland.<br/><br/>So, when I was first considering a new XP system, I thought about structuring the Keys for Changeling in this format:\n<blockquote>Do X Key Thing - Gain 1 XP<br/>Do X+ Key Thing - Gain 2 XP &amp; 1 WP<br/>Do X++ Key Thing - Gain 3 XP &amp; 2 WP<br/>Buyoff: Gain a new Key (eventually) and a complete WP refresh (only once you've chosen a new Key).</blockquote>\nThe numbers could be fudged a bit from that, but the idea would be to have a way for characters to gain XP and WP from accomplishing their personal goals or the goals of their Court, Seeming, or organization, replacing the existing XP and WP recovery mechanics.<br/><br/>Today, though, I was reading through a section of the Changeling book that talks about Pledges.  Pledges are one of the neatest aspects of this game, because they are basically these arbitrary and mechanic-less guidelines for building magically-binding agreements.  You pick the type of promise it is (Vow or Oath), something to swear by (a name, God, a symbolic object), the promise itself (the Task), the duration, the thing you gain for keeping the promise (the Boon), and the consequences for breaking it (the Sanction), and, then, the Pledge has a degree of magical potency based on the elements that compose it, which you can leverage to do stuff.<br/><br/>After reading this, I was struck by the thought: <b>what if Keys in this Changeling hack are merely Pledges to oneself</b>, promises to be true to certain codes of conduct, and deliver XP and/or WP when they are fulfilled, as their Boon? I think XP-delivering Pledges could be short-term Vows ("I won't let the Duke belittle me!") or longer-term Oaths ("I will find my lost sister, whatever it takes!"). The Tasks would be the XP-generating conditions, as in Keys, and the Sanction would be part of the Buyoff. Seems like this could work really well, since Keys and Pledges are similar in several important respects.<br/><br/>One potential issue I see is that, in TSOY, buying off Keys is incentivized because it makes for interesting stories if characters make dramatic, life-changing decisions on occasion (though not, of course, if they are making them constantly, without much buildup). Pledges, however, can have really onerous Sanctions (frex: death) that make the Buyoff that happens in TSOY not as feasible.  It seems like, if these are promises Changelings make to themselves in their secret heart of hearts, things like "Speak the truth to no mortal man" or "Those who defy me must pay in blood and fire," it seems unlikely that they would set as harsh a penalty for being untrue to themselves. However, there should be some consequence or there's nothing keeping players from flitting about between various self-pledges and experience conditions, leading to characters with random personalities instead of ones that develop over time, if occasionally in dramatic ways.<br/><br/>So I guess I'm looking for a way to marry Sanctions and Buyoffs.  What should be the conditions for breaking self-Pledges that are negative enough to give them some weight as Keys, but also interesting (so they they are good choices to make sometimes, driving the story in cool directions) and something characters can do without ending up horribly weakened or injured because of it?<br/><br/>For starters, the Sanctions listed in the book include:<br/>- Banishment<br/>- Curses (makes all your rolls worse)<br/>- Death<br/>- Flaws ("May fate strike me blind")<br/>- Pishogues (magical attacking spells woven into the promise)<br/>- Poisonings of the Boon (doesn't really seem to work if the Boon is XP, maybe WP though?)<br/>- Vulnerabilities (to magic or being attacked)<br/><br/>Looking at this list, the only thing that comes to mind is that maybe a character has to spend a bunch of WP (all of it?) in order to break a self-Pledge.  Then they would have to act immediately on their new self-Pledge (Key) to gain more WP, which kinda works.  In that case, the Buyoff conditions that I originally suggested above, where players refill their WP by taking a new Key, wouldn't necessarily work.<br/><br/>Any better ideas?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105348">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105348/#Comment_105348" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-29T09:06:58+00:00" title="October 29, 2007  9:06AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Morality check!<br/><br/>I like your idea.  The buyoff condition in TSOY is self-regulating because you can never take the same key twice.  So yeah, you can be an ass and buy and buy off Keys with wild abandon, but eventually:<br/><br/>1.  You are going to run out of Keys<br/>2.  You will be seen as a dickweed <br/>3.  As you mention, without some development it's just weak<br/><br/>It seems like Pledges would be even more personal than Keys, and the permanent buyoff would be an even more serious consideration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105352/#Comment_105352" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-29T09:20:25+00:00" title="October 29, 2007  9:20AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Without reading the new Changeling, its hard to answer this question.

That's pretty different than the TSOY model, but would give this game a different kind of tone.  More like: "Promises, even to oneself, are not to be made lightly."<br/><br/>I'm getting some suggestions from <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=361657" rel="nofollow">a very helpful guy on RPGnet now</a> who's saying that breaking promises to yourself could potentially make Changelings lose their sense of self and go a little bonkers (gaining a Derangement) until they can rectify things somehow.  That might get at what you're talking about a little bit better.<br/><br/>I'm sorry it's hard to address this without familiarity with the game.  I'm having trouble finding people who speak both World of Darkness and TSOY, which, I guess, says something about the state of various roleplaying fandoms.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105360">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105360/#Comment_105360" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-29T09:47:13+00:00" title="October 29, 2007  9:47AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan, <br/><br/>One of the things that occurred to me on reading the Lost was that, while I didn't like Clarity mechanically, one of the things that Clarity did in the game was make perception checks interesting for the first time in White Wolf history. Blowing a perception check no longer just means you don't notice something (dull!), it means you notice something in a twisted way that fits with your delusions and Wyrd. Because of this I was thinking of having each character define a way that their delusions go, so that when they blow a roll the glamour warping of their perceptions fits with the character's idiom/issues/whatever. <br/><br/>So maybe that Clarity idea can stick around. When you buyoff a pledge-key, in addition to any other sanctions you may take from the pledge (which as noclue pointed out are probably much less harsh than ones you'd give to others), you gain a "Secret of Clarity Loss" -- for free? -- that gives you a penalty dice (or so) whenever you're in a conflict based around perception/getting new information/dealing with mundane crap. When the penalty dice comes into play, you get to describe how your character has those glamour delusions, and how that affects their interactions. However, the Secret may also give you a bonus dice whenever you're using any magical secret/contract -- because as your Clarity drops your Wyrd rises. <br/><br/>You could buy off the secret eventually, if you want to, or you could get them all stacked up until you're at a mass of penalty dice to deal with mortal perceptions and interactions, but a whack of bonus dice to contracts. <br/><br/>Just a fast idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105363">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105363/#Comment_105363" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-29T09:58:54+00:00" title="October 29, 2007  9:58AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just to clarify, my point was that the sanctions given for untruth to one's self could be very harsh indeed. Harsher than being untrue to someone else. I see how the opposite could have been inferred from my post. <br/><br/>I like the idea of a changeling slipping further and further into faerie and losing contact with this world. People who are touched by faerie should be changed by it. Not sure how much I care for a morality check as the way to model that though. Brand's idea of buying off a pledge through loss of reality, might work.<br/><br/>Another thought I had would be that to buy off a pledge what if you had to negotiate with Maeve or Oberon for release. They could absolve you of your pledge...for a price. <br/><br/>Lastly, some pledges you could buy off in other narrative ways...like that pledge about not letting the Baron belittle you. Well, if he's dead....                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105372">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DevP" title="DevP"><img alt="DevP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/818/nB2L0MAZS1OU2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DevP">DevP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105372/#Comment_105372" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-29T11:10:15+00:00" title="October 29, 2007 11:10AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the core of it - pledges to yourself =&gt; keys - look fine to go; you could possibly meter the XP gains to the degree of the Sanction attached. (You could come up with some "soft" Sanctions for self-pledges, but these will give miserly XP out.) Another thing: you could keep Clarity, and be docked Clarity (or roll to prevent losing Clarity) when you break a pledge, and perhaps allow picking up new Clarity when you pick up a new pledge, especially for picking up one you'd previously abandoned.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105387">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105387/#Comment_105387" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-29T11:42:13+00:00" title="October 29, 2007 11:42AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, I still kinda like TSOY thing of having XP gained to be relative to the difficulty of the Task, not the severity of the Sanction.

And that, I think, would work swimmingly.\n<blockquote>Another thing: you could keep Clarity, and be docked Clarity (or roll to prevent losing Clarity) when you break a pledge, and perhaps allow picking up new Clarity when you pick up a new pledge, especially for picking up one you'd previously abandoned.</blockquote>\nNot so coincidentally, this is exactly the kind of thing we're now discussing in the RPGnet thread, and it's probably the most elegant solution yet.
