"You're J Random Character in a Bewilderingly Wide Open Universe" just doesn't cut it. That is, for the group, I think you have to identify something tighter like playing out the actions of the characters in some interstellar war. Or even coming up with the characters ala PTA as an ensemble cast for a Traveller TV show. Ala Firefly. Then making the play about the character's issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nMake the characters about more than their assets, and that's a start.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ColinC" title="ColinC"><img alt="ColinC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ColinC">ColinC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71643/#Comment_71643" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-24T09:06:33+00:00" title="May 24, 2007  9:06AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 24, 2007 9:13AM by ColinC.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some thoughts:<br><br>Troupe-style Play: There are online character generators that let you create up to 16 Classic Traveller characters in one go.  Crank out a ship's crew or mercenary team and play up the interactions with them as well as sending them on "missions".<br><br>Narrow the Focus:  There is an old box set for Traveller called "Tarsus: World Beyond the Frontier" which details a single world on the frontiers of the Empire.  Apart from the railroady scenario that's included, it's a pretty good box.  By confining all the action to a single planet you preclude the need for a spaceship and give yourself some creative constraint.<br><br>Add Theme:  We played a Firefly-themed GURPS Traveller game previously, complete with a Companion and a gun-nut.  In the future I plan on running a First Blood/Billy Jack type game about war vets returning to their rural homeworld (using the Tarsus box). This is similar to the creative constraints above.<br><br>Tweak the setting:  Make the Imperium weaker or more corrupt?  Give the local nobles more power?  Setting things on the lawless frontier tends to help too.<br/><br/>...oh, and run it using Fate 3.0 ^-^<br/><br/>(Edit: Crossposted with Mike.  Funny how Firefly popped up in both posts, but it's a pretty logical way to awesomifiy the game after all ^-^)                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_71644">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71644/#Comment_71644" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-24T09:20:47+00:00" title="May 24, 2007  9:20AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I first saw John Huston's <i>The Man Who Would be King</i>, I thought, "That's it! That's a Traveller game!"<br/>\n<br/>\nIt stars Sean Connery and Michael Caine as two British soldiers drummed out of the British Empire's Army while serving in India.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey scam some money, buy a ton of guns, and head into the mountains of Afghanistan to set themselves up as warlords.  They've been serving everyone else all their lives, but now they're going to have people serve them!<br/>\n<br/>\nThey find this peaceful nation buried far out of the way and take it over.  But then one of them is seen as a King by the natives, jealousy starts to creep in... it's great.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, it's not about <i>space</i>.  But it is about guys who have been part of an Imperial military who have to figure out what to do.  It's set at the fringes of the empire -- and then beyond -- which is an easy set up for a Traveller game.  All this is portable to a space setting -- and I think Marc Miller and others had this sort of set up in mind when coming up with the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it has strong issues for the characters, and goals.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile the Firefly model is a good one for Traveller, I was always intrigued with spinning SF into situations like Captain Sir Richard Burton tracking down the source of the Nile and so on.... Men with ambition, like the characters in <i>The Man Who Would be King</i> who had failed to make impression in society that they wanted, and were driven to extreme measures to make that impression. (Which, also, is part of the Traveller set-up if you look at the Social Rank, the social climbing through the services, and so on...)<br/>\n<br/>\nAmbition -- social ambition specifically, with the money and assets only there to serve that, strike me as an excellent way to go (among many) to Awesomize Black Box Traveller.<br/>\n<br/>\nChristopher                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71645">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ColinC" title="ColinC"><img alt="ColinC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ColinC">ColinC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71645/#Comment_71645" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-24T09:30:27+00:00" title="May 24, 2007  9:30AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>Ambition -- social ambition specifically, with the money and assets only there to serve that, strike me as an excellent way to go (among many) to Awesomize Black Box Traveller.</blockquote>\nGood point.

In the British Emprire model, you muster these guys out and now what happens to them.  Some go home.  Others stay in India or Africa or go to the Barbary Coast...<br/>\n<br/>\nThey have all these skills.  Space is wide open -- with a wide range of technologies (just like the British Empire) that let a smaller number of men with high tech weapons take over low tech communities.  And then how high do you go...?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou bring in issues of <i>why</i> the character is doing this... dad slighted me, the woman I love's family won't let me near her because I'm lower class and so forth... I'm serving this man who would be king because he saved my life...<br/>\n<br/>\nThis brings in tons of material about exploiting other through money and technology for personal gain and so forth.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the weird thing -- for me -- is all this -- and what Colin said -- was in the Little Black Books.. But buried. And the mechanics gave you no way to actually get the issues tied to the game play.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd because the rules focused on how to fix an airlock -- yada, yada, yada.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I loved about the LBBs was the promise of premise stitched into the setting and character creation.  But then the rules focus yanked that all away and gave no support to the premise.  What I'd be doing is looking at the raw, unprocessed ore in the setting and character creation material that got us so excited and grow out the mechanics and premise issues from that.<br/>\n<br/>\nchristopher<br/>\n<br/>\nedited to add: And in this way, I'm saying in this model of the game, the underlying story structure has more to do with the type of tale told in, say, the tales of Conan on the way to becoming a king, than they have to do with what we normally consider SF.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71649">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71649/#Comment_71649" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-24T09:44:11+00:00" title="May 24, 2007  9:44AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My concept for an aborted-due-to-lack-of-players Traveller-derived game was "journalists, aid workers, and covert agents in a war zone".<br><br>I've always wanted to do one where the PCs are literally "professional travellers" - travel journalists, writing about their adventures for some galactic version of <i>National Geographic</i> and constantly facing all kinds of stuff around the sticky boundaries between ethnography and orientalism, cosmopolitan galactic civilization and outright imperialism, tourism and exploitation.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_71651">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71651/#Comment_71651" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-24T09:48:45+00:00" title="May 24, 2007  9:48AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mark,<br/>\n<br/>\nThat sounds cool.

The decisions those characters/players made would generate the "scenarios" for the lower level crewmen.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71669">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon" title="Vaxalon"><img alt="Vaxalon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/42393690/1509967"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon">Vaxalon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71669/#Comment_71669" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-24T11:37:27+00:00" title="May 24, 2007 11:37AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Temporal coordination could be an issue, but hey, the Star Trek freeformers manage.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_71677">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71677/#Comment_71677" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-24T12:03:14+00:00" title="May 24, 2007 12:03PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Azhanti High Lightning... that's a blast from the past...<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those unaware, AHL was basically a big map with scenarios for the miniatures game Snapshot. When I say big map, it was actually the deck plans for a pretty large starship. In fact, what you got was several prototypical deck maps that were cross-sections of a sorta conical shaped ship. Meaning that there might be ten of deck X, and 12 of deck Y in the ship as a whole. A lot of play was trying to outmaneuver other characters as they ran all over the ship, by going from deck to deck, or hiding out on some less used deck. Or using the dangerous maneuver of using the access hatches to the spinal meson gun mount to get into it so that you could move around that way (praying that the wouldn't fire the darn thing while you were in there). Same with the figher launch tubes.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou get the idea, I hope.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, Traveller is chock full of this sort of simmy stuff that's available. You can get deck plans for all of the common types of ships, for instance. As I've said somewhere else, I've always wanted to figure out some way to make all of this sort of element pay in a game that's more about drama.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot sure why I want that, but I do.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich is what makes Judd's idea seem interesting to me. I'm not sure I get what you're on to here Judd. Is the idea that you create tension simply by having the players make up canon details, and let the game system contradict that, and use that to come up with conflicts somehow?

(Remember that blast from the past, kids?)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, they travel parsecs off course and end up in a new star system. The GM tosses some dice to find out where the heck they are.  He figures out what the main planet is like, tech-level and more. No color yet, just a string of digits that make you go... "Hmmmmm.... I wonder what's going on here."<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, there's suddenly two ways of moving forward on this:<br/>\n<br/>\nOne is to stop play for a week as the GM comes back with 40 pages of notes, colored maps diving the planet into little areas of interest and so on... (And then freaking out if the players say, "Nah..." and start making their way back to civilization without so much a backward glance at the world the GM just created.)  This is sort of the "GM must be master of the of Sim world" way of handling it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other way is for <i>everyone</i> to look at the numbers and go, "Okay, now what?"  This is more the Narrativism-<i>Primtime Adventures</i> series creation-<i>Sorcerer &amp; Sword</i> build the world as you go approach, where the GM isn't keeping everything secret, but everyone has input on the details so everyone is vested in what's going on.  Sure the GM will be making up MORE stuff... But using the randomly generated world details as a group exercise in  creative Narrative Juice just seems healthy.  (Frankly, I think taking Ron's comments from <i>Sorcery &amp; Sword</i>'s world building section and mixing them with the <i>Traveller</i> LBBs is vital to the <i>Traveller</i> Awesomizing Process.)<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me the random world generation process acts as a sort of humbling stopgap for the GM -- "Dude, you're not going to be able to map 11,000 worlds -- and there's no point!"<br/>\n<br/>\nIt gets everyone closer on the shared distribution of Narrative authority.  It means we're all kind of in this together as we explore this strange thing called space.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Caveat: again, I'm not saying the GM is always walking around blind. I'm saying, every world becomes a chance to slow things down and to pre-play work that is always helplful to Nar games.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71684">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71684/#Comment_71684" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-24T12:21:26+00:00" title="May 24, 2007 12:21PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Christopher, your starship is in the same sector as mine.<br><br>Prepare to dock.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_71686">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71686/#Comment_71686" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-24T12:33:31+00:00" title="May 24, 2007 12:33PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I get it now.

(The final straw was <i>Swordbearer</i>, where I was given very detailed instruction on how to build an elaborate map, and then sub maps and so on -- and then realized I'd done all this work but still hadn't connected the material to Player Characters <i>at all</i>...)<br/>\n<br/>\nLooking back, I could see I was beginning to see that all that really mattered was what mattered to the Players, via their PCs.  It's like this: I'm a player, I've got a PC.  My PC is on a planet. In a subsector.  That's part of a sector.  That's part of an Empire of 11,000 worlds.  Now.  What do those 10,999 other worlds have to do with my PC right now?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the key is, for the fun I'd want to have -- and the kind of fun we like to have at Story Games, is a relationship map.  Which I kind of intuited as a kid because of the whole "family loyalty holds the Imperium together" thing... but the distances seemed to vast and I didn't want to impede what Mike called "You're J Random Character in a Bewilderingly Wide Open Universe."<br/>\n<br/>\nTo make the game work you HAVE to tie them down with emotional ties.  They can run off -- but then they're making a choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for Mike's dream day at Gen Con... Dude... I think you're talking about a sim board game -- some sort of Civilization Ad Astra -- where stars hang in the balance and you keep going from this fucking HUGE map of the Imperium down to starfleet and and ground warfare battles -- zooming in and out on the scale for about 5 days f Mountain Dew fueled craziness. This let's you use all the maps, all the info, with a Referee or two adding in unexpected turns and twists like an old school Miniature battles game as they draw on all the GDW &amp; Co. sim background material to say, "Regina's government has allied with the sword worlds against the Imperium!"<br/>\n<br/>\nYou keep playing -- sort of role playing the way you sort of roleplay in Diplomacy...<br/>\n<br/>\nIt wouldn't be an RPG -- but it would be <i>something</i>!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71730">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71730/#Comment_71730" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-24T15:51:10+00:00" title="May 24, 2007  3:51PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 24, 2007 3:53PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So...

One is to have the significant ties be within the group. In this variant, the new worlds are not a source of new relationships, but a source of new stressors for the ongoing relationships. <i>Star Trek</i> is about Kirk, Spock, and McCoy, not the various characters-of-the-week. The other is to have the ties be to <i>roles</i>, not individuals. The protagonist(s) keep running into characters who represent some new spin on their issue(s). Malcolm Reynolds keeps running into people who challenge his loyalty and moral sense. Kirk keeps running into women who allow him to demonstrate his virility and reinforce the primacy of the male-male bond over sentimental attachments.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ColinC" title="ColinC"><img alt="ColinC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ColinC">ColinC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71799/#Comment_71799" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-25T08:32:39+00:00" title="May 25, 2007  8:32AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Metal Fatigue</cite>How do you justify it in<i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>?</blockquote>\nIn Dogs the PCs are in a fairly confined geographical region (The USA), and ostensibly they're "making the rounds".  Coming back to towns they've already been to before and meeting up with kinfolk who have settled in the region previously.  A similar model in Traveller would be the Navy patrol or merchanter who works a regular route, but it wouldn't work as well for the jet-setting Traveller's Aid Society member who never visits the same planet twice.<br><br>For the jet-setting TAS member model, or say the crew of a Scout Service ship, I like Mark W's ideas.

Even if it ain't perfect, I've never seen a bit of Traveller stuff and thought, "Damn, that's lame material."<br/>\n<br/>\n"Impertient to play?" Sure. But never dumb.<br/>\n<br/>\nI may have to start a new thread on Chris' very awesome idea. Sounds a lot like National Security Decision Making, but using the Imperium as the world instead of the real world. That could work.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it's not what this thread is supposed to be about. My bad.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHoly hell, that's Seth Blumberg up there! Hi Seth! Haven't heard from you in an age. I think you've hit on something. You can do it otherwise, but it's not really Traveller if the PCs don't, you know, do some traveling. Meaning that I think Traveller should be episodic, and, yeah, if not precisely one world - one adventure, at least regular shifts of scenery (including more than once a session, in some cases).<br/>\n<br/>\nLooking at what Chris was saying (and I like where you're going with that SA-type system), you could have a way to build relationship maps that span worlds. I mean, "travellers" are most likely to have most of their aquiantances amongst other travellers, no? That's not to say that there won't be connections to people on certain planets that are non-travellers. But simply that it's possible to encounter anyone in a starport as you travel about.<br/>\n<br/>\nPut more simply, some of the r-map can be mobile, while other parts are stationary. This links the character to an area of space, but doesn't nail them down to just one planet. Fits in very well with the whole idea of the tramp freighter crew plying a set of space-lanes that tend to lead them wherever the cargo goes.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Note that I don't have any problems with the notion of a single planet game, I just think that it's missing out on 90% of what's in the LBBs. That said there is a supplement that's includes NPC write ups for every inhabitant of a single system... all 62 of them or whatever. So that's certainly it's own interesting option).<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm seeing a very large R-map... make the game somewhat about networking really (and what happens when that network gets stressed, of course). The network can expand/contract as loyalties are tested. I'm seeing something like the TMW trust mechanics as a main form of Spiritual Atrribute for a system like Chris'. How much trust do you have in NPC X? You can add to it at will. But when they turn around and screw you, using those dice against you, it's going to hurt.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy bringing the socio-political and technological issues to life through the NPCs, then, you make the setting material you generate pertinent to the players.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat could definitely work.<br/>\n<br/>\nFollowing on what Colin is saying, I think that you could make all skills capable of producing NPCs like the Circles (?) rules from BE. So PCs could be constantly meeting folks they've previously met when it's convenient for that to happen. Then you determine a trust level, and move on...<br/>\n<br/>\nWe may have to write this up. I think I'm going to run it at GenCon.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71928">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Metal%20Fatigue" title="Metal Fatigue"><img alt="Metal Fatigue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://msen.com/~sethb/xkcd-sqrt-love.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Metal%20Fatigue">Metal Fatigue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71928/#Comment_71928" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-25T17:15:05+00:00" title="May 25, 2007  5:15PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 25, 2007 5:16PM by Metal Fatigue.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Holy hell, that's Seth Blumberg up there!

So take my comments with appropriate salty granularity.<br><br>What I loved about Traveller was the world generation system. What drove me crazy about Traveller was the world generation system. Specifically, you get a bunch of neat and semi-relevant facts about each particular planet, but no guidance on how to connect different worlds to one another or on how to fill in the details of a single world: All the rules-structure is on one level with nothing above or below.<br><br>So I ended up inventing my own rules for those. For example, if you roll a "Balkanized" world, i.e. one without a unified government, you roll a random number of contending governments assumed to be all of the same size/power, and if one of them gets a "Balkanized" result, you roll subgovernments for that representing even smaller countries, etc. potentially ad infinitum. Or, in the biggest thing I ever did, I rolled up six subsectors for which the backstory was three waves of settlement, starting with indigenous species building pocket empires, moving to a Vargr invasion, and finally human colonists; so I rolled two additional stats for each world indicating human:Vargr population mix and presence of indigenous races -- and of course each subsector had modifiers reflecting which population tended to be locally dominant. That gave me a <i>huge</i> amount of interstellar and individual-planet detail to work with.<br><br>So what I'd really like to see for Traveller is a set of standard cultural types (say, Vilani, Solomani, Sylean, etc.) with some real guidance on how each one tends to act -- not just "Vilani are traditional and by the book blah blah blah" -- and rules on how to roll up the relative influence of each culture on a specific world depending on its astropolitical and historical context. For example, instead of rolling every world individually, you could start with the first world colonized n the system, and then roll for the worlds it established colonies on, and then for the worlds they colonized in turn, getting deviations from the original "seed" culture at each step, and potential for cross-fertilization or conflict with other cultures that had been there before or which were expanding into the same area of space along a different route.<br><br>In the process I'd want to throw out the "Imperium" altogether, honestly. The LBB's intro text promised an 18th-century setting of swashbuckling adventure and intrigue, so I'd want to have multiple empires (with distinct cultures) competing to colonize new worlds and conquer long-settled ones in their own distinctive ways. I'd like to be able to make distinctions like those that occurred in history, e.g. the French having a fairly light presence on the ground in North America with traders and fur trappers, but generally good relations with the Indians, while the English sent larger numbers of settlers who stuck to themselves and tended to piss off the Indians in the process, while the Spanish tended to have gotten to the richest, most sophisticated American civilizations first, which they tended to plunder, enslave, and intermarry with.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72033">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72033/#Comment_72033" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-27T07:42:33+00:00" title="May 27, 2007  7:42AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't toyed with the lifepath system yet, but I was thinking that the way I might do it is have everyone roll up five PC's, take the one they like the most as their PC and the rest become NPC's in their relationship map (dead ones included).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_72034">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sydney%20Freedberg" title="Sydney Freedberg"><img alt="Sydney Freedberg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sydney%20Freedberg">Sydney Freedberg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72034/#Comment_72034" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-27T07:45:31+00:00" title="May 27, 2007  7:45AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 27, 2007 8:04PM by Sydney Freedberg.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [whoops: crossposted]<br><br>P.S.: I think what I've outlined <i>totally</i> synergizes with Christopher Kubasik's dead-on brilliant idea for a "Man who would be King" game.

And it provoked full scale social meltdown in an Earthdawn game our group attempted back in the early 90s.<br><br>Historically, games either try to teach genre through a) colorful fictiony stuff and illustrations in the rulebooks, and maybe ancillary novels, which requires  the players reading the same source material as the GM, or the GM digesting and subsetting it for them somehow, or the GM riding herd on genre during play, or b) they allow genre to emerge in play via some combination of reward mechanics and player preferences.<br><br><em>Primetime Adventures</em> and <em>My Life with Master</em> both use solution-b. <em>Primetime Adventures</em> skews more toward creating genre from player preferences. <em>My Life with Master</em> skews toward genre from reward mechanics. From the perspective of genre, the Intimacy, Desperation, and Sincerity dice in <em>My Life with Master</em> are functionally equivalent to experience point awards for killing folks and taking their stuff in AD&amp;D.<br><br>Clearly solution-a isn't working for Traveller. And the "player preferences" half of solution-b doesn't seem to be what folks are looking for. So, is there some option other than targeted reward mechanics? Because yes, Trust and Circles mechanics are fun, but I'm not seeing how they're particularly tuned to the Traveller genre. The design question isn't, "What reward structure might be interesting?" It's "What reward structure would deliver the Traveller genre?"<br><br>Paul                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_72366">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72366/#Comment_72366" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-29T09:12:59+00:00" title="May 29, 2007  9:12AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know that we can describe a game as successful as Traveller as "not working".

The question is whether or not you want "Sci-Fi Genre" or "Space Opera." Space Opera is not, not, not, sci-fi. It is "Opera" with a very thin sci-fi veneer.<br/>\n<br/>\n[The term X-Opera is an interesting one, historically, and quite apt. Opera itself never really bothers much with adherence to historical detail or anything at all that might get in the way of the drama of the plot. "Horse Operas" were the Westerns that came out that, again, were really not at all about the West as a genre, but just using it as a rustic backdrop for the dramas to play out. "Soap Operas" are the same sort of dramas played out in the lives of people who are just like the housewife targeted who is cleaning up the house as she watches them out of the corner of her eye. "Space Opera" is quite the same. The sci-fi elements are just there to make the surroundings seem adventurous and exotic.]<br/>\n<br/>\nThe LBBs are somewhat silent on the issue, though it's no co-incidence that Traveller came out on the heels of Star Wars. Nor that most of the characters in the section on the book where you're supposed to guess who the unnamed characters are come from Star Wars and it's ilk. Where the LBBs are silent is that, of course, they present a wargame for rules, which doesn't support either Space Opera nor sci-fi. In anything the mechanics of space trade are actually leaning towards actual sci-fi... the premise being something like "What would interstellar trade be like in a world where the physics of travel made the tramp freighter a viable notion once again?" But, mostly it's "What's combat like in a high-tech universe like this one?"<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically I think that you can't trust to the books for inspiration either way for what, I think, most of us here are looking to get out of traveller. (Yep, JD, I think that it's safe to say that any Awsemofy thread is going to be about dissatisfaction with the original product not working as somebody would like it to work - which is not to say that the original is broken for everyone).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo you gotta ask yourself the question. Which do I want? Or, at least, how much actual sci-fi do I want in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause it's dead easy to do the color thing. If technology, space, aliens, etc, are all just color, I don't think it really takes hardly any effort to "ride herd." In fact mechanics like BE's resources mechanics allow players to add this sort of color at will. I recall actually allowing my players to create technology at need... the idea that any set of resource books could cover all of the technology available in the 53rd century across a feudal empire of 11,000 worlds seemed so preposterous to me that (even though I was hardcore sim back then) I allowed players to narrate in technology at need. With the understanding that everyone has tech, and so it never gives a mechanical advantage unless paid for somehow.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I beat Luke to that punch by more than a decade. 'Course I was never smart enough to publish the idea...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, if you do want sci-fi, then you're going to have to establish some "what if?" premises for play and have a system that revolves around that. So, yeah, Shock. Or something that does the same job.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow about this? To use your skills to create an NPC, you have to find an "Issue" to which the NPC is linked. Something that the PC is undecided about, that comes about because of the setting. For instance, even from the black books, IIRC, the Psionics conflict is established. So a character can be created that's a member of the Psionics Institute, and then this puts the PC in the place of having to consider the ramifications of Psionics.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSydney, yeah. In addition to wanting to throw out the Imperium as it stands (much as I love it), we have to for purposes of this thread. That is, the LBBs don't say a whole lot about the Imperium. IIRC, Book Zero adds a bit, if we're including it, but I think the key is to say the following facts:<br/>\n<br/>\n- There is an inter-stellar government called the Imperium.<br/>\n- Jump drive technology means that travel from system to system takes time on the order of weeks.<br/>\n- Since information travels at the speed of Jump Drives, it's neccessary that the Imperium be feudal in order to maintain order.<br/>\n- So they allow each world to rule itself, and only control things like interstellar trade (including interdicting trade of things like weapons of mass-destruction).<br/>\n- Psionics exist, but are underground because of prejudice against it (possibly warranted, possibly not).<br/>\n- The PCs are usually "Travellers" members of the "imperial" culture, in that they tend to be under Imperial rule most of the time as they travel from world to world, and tend to have a somewhat more cosmopolitan view of the worlds of the empire.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, perhaps, a few more facts like that (there's a Travellers Aid Society, for instance). Only whatever facts are in books zero to three. But, otherwise, create the details at need as play progresses.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for how this develops, I'm not sure I'm getting your idea here. I see two things in your post (either of which may be an incorrect perception):<br/>\n1. The starting major cultures start with very high level assumptions that mostly describe how each culture deals with what it encounters.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. The rules for world generation should be used not only to enumerate large chunks of society, but also be "internally recursive" if you will, meaning that you can use them to "drill down" to smaller levels and find exceptions.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, cool. But if you're sticking to the stuff in the LBBs, then there's not much to work with, other than the creative sort of drilling that you seem to have come up with. That is, I'm sensing that you may have used tools like Grand Survey and such from later works to get those Megatraveller (relatively) high depth analyses? I'd be tempted to use such as well, because no matter how far a system like this details, it's never really enough to flesh out the world fully (such that creativity is inhibited). But I wouldn't want to use them except to the extent that they could be used quickly in play.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is somewhere, of course, some free bit of software that randomly generates Traveller worlds. I recall one called Accrete at one point. There's every chance that somebody has put together one that takes into account the more complext world generation...<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it should suffice that the system will work with just the data from the LBBs. Yes, yes, yes, you absolutely need to be able to drill down through he generalities and find out smaller levels of details where variations will occur. Obviously this happens with NPCs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm seeing a rule for "exceptions" that allows the player to take a random generality and create a case inside of it that's an exception to it. So, for instance, one of the things that bugs me a bit about LBB Traveller is that it only enumerates the single planet in each star system that has the greatest population. This might be accurate if imprecise for some systems, but there must be some few where the population is split evenly over more than one body. So the GM rolls up a Water World at some point, but a player decides he wants an exception. Well it's either a Water World or it's not, right? The player makes his exception, "Though the highest population world is a Water World, there's another in system that''s not a Water World that has nearly the same population on it."<br/>\n<br/>\nYou get the picture (I hope).<br/>\n<br/>\nThoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_72387">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72387/#Comment_72387" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-29T10:25:12+00:00" title="May 29, 2007 10:25AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<ul>"- There is an inter-stellar government called the Imperium.<br>- Jump drive technology means that travel from system to system takes time on the order of weeks.<br>- Since information travels at the speed of Jump Drives, it's neccessary that the Imperium be feudal in order to maintain order.<br>- So they allow each world to rule itself, and only control things like interstellar trade (including interdicting trade of things like weapons of mass-destruction).<br>- Psionics exist, but are underground because of prejudice against it (possibly warranted, possibly not).<br>- The PCs are usually "Travellers" members of the "imperial" culture, in that they tend to be under Imperial rule most of the time as they travel from world to world, and tend to have a somewhat more cosmopolitan view of the worlds of the empire."</br></br></br></br></br></ul>\nThose are great. Exactly the bullet points we need at this point in the conversation. But they're not genre, so the next step is to think about genre. <br><br>The game is already rewarding players pushing for older characters in chargen. So age and aging has to be part of the genre.<br><br>And y'know, I never really inhaled the Star Wars connection from the three black books. The game never felt like it was wanting to be space opera to me. It felt like it was wanting to be something designed by Larry Niven, or Jerry Pournelle, or James P. Hogan, a genre in which not only does the alien exist, but in which it's rushing into your life, sweeping you up in threats and new possibilities and forcing you to learn and learn and learn. That's the genre of Traveller to me: no matter how old you are, how experienced you are, you never can coast on the knowledge you have. Experience prepares you for taking risks with confidence. Lack of experience means its more chaotic and painful when you're swept up by risk. But always the life of a protagonist is being confronted by threats that are beyond you. Always you have to learn.<br><br>Paul                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72462">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72462/#Comment_72462" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-29T14:03:11+00:00" title="May 29, 2007  2:03PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not seeing it, Paul.<br/>\n<br/>\nI mean, OK, so aging can be a theme in Traveller (there are three rules that deal with it mechanically, Skill aquisition, aging rolls, and anagathics). But I think that the bullets I listed have at least as much weight. First, one third of the mechanics of the game deal with starships, their cost, how they operate, and how that makes the universe the way it is, including the frontier and feudal elements of the imperium. The Psionics have thier own chapter. The chargen system creates mostly military characters (even if you generate "other" characters, sometimes they end up in the military!) and characters suitable as travellers.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo... I'm not seeing how your one element has any more weight as a determinant of genre. For one thing, I'm not sure that the Traveller mechanics should be trusted to drive genre at all. But if they are, then I think that my bullets have quite as much weight as your one point does.<br/>\n<br/>\nI dunno, I have a gestalt feeling about Traveller that I feel is interesting as a genre.

And the line I'm on is: via reward mechanics. (Folks have written about some nicely thematic games on the other Traveller thread, but I don't think anyone's thinking the game itself brought much agency in those themes.) My comment about older characters is related to the game's existing reward structure. Having a bunch of mechanics for starships and psionics isn't equivalent to actually rewarding players for pushing for older characters. If the game is already rewarding for something, and we're talking about reward mechanics as the vector of a game driving its themes, then the genre has to ingest the aging thing somehow, because it's part of the reward system that we have driving player authorial decisions. The rest of the stuff about learning is me extracting key themes from source material I think inspired Traveller. To actually awesomize Traveller...we'd have to work some elegant mechanics into the game for rewarding the learning and experience themes: more chaotic and painful kickers for less experienced characters; more awareness of risks and opposition for older characters; more planned and predictable upsides to risks for experienced characters; and scenario-wise, always situations that force characters to use and develop their lesser-developed skills.<br><br>Paul                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72482">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sydney%20Freedberg" title="Sydney Freedberg"><img alt="Sydney Freedberg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sydney%20Freedberg">Sydney Freedberg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72482/#Comment_72482" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-29T15:14:09+00:00" title="May 29, 2007  3:14PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 29, 2007 3:14PM by Sydney Freedberg.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Sydney...I see two things in your post (either of which may be an incorrect perception):<br>1. The starting major cultures start with very high level assumptions that mostly describe how each culture deals with what it encounters.<br><br>2.

And yes, they'd have to be layered on top of the existing planetary-generation rules in the Little Black Books -- but if Paul Czege can talk about adding kicker mechanics, I think that's a relatively modest addition! As with my six subsector thing: It amounted to "roll 1, population is 100% Vargr; roll 2, population is 90% Vargr / 10% human; roll 3, 60%/40%; roll 4, 40%/60%; roll 5, 10%/90%; roll 7, 100% human -- add +1 or +2 to the roll in human-heavy subsectors, -1 or -2 in Vargr-heavy subsectors" -- that's it!\n<blockquote>I'm sensing that you may have used tools like Grand Survey and such from later works to get those Megatraveller (relatively) high depth analyses?</blockquote>\nIronically, I've never even heard of the "Grand Survey." I did have Megatraveller and mess around with its "extended" system generation, but it's the exact wrong kind of elaboration: lots more physics details about planetary bodies, next to nothing about the people who live there.<br><br>What I'd like to see instead is -- at a minumum -- say, a page that tells you how a Vargr or Vilani or Zhodhani or whatever culture is organized in general, and then a short paragraph apiece on what it means when you roll a "feudal technocracy" on a Zho planet, or a "Charismatic Dictatorship" among Vilani, or a "Corporate" state among Vargr. And each of these paragraphs would include socio-political conflicts that could be used as<br>- <b>Kickers</b>: "My character is a high-caste Vilani on a world conquered by Vargr pirates. I must fight to preserve the old ways and assimilate these new rulers into the system!" (Thinking very much of India and the British here, or the Chinese and the Mongols).<br>- <b>Bangs</b>: "So your character is the Solomani in the crew, right? Well, the local bureaucracy here is Solomani-dominated. They're happy to give you the trading permits, but you'd better not hang out with those other PCs while you're on this planet."<br>- <b>adventure seeds</b>: "There's been race riots between the local Vilani and Solomani, and the Vargr overlord wants you guys to calm things down, by whatever means necessary."<br>- <b> just color</b>: "Of course the High Commissioner sees you. These guys are Zhodani, remember, so there's about 50 minutes of drinking tea and reading your surface thoughts before he gets down to substantive business."                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_72497">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alan" title="Alan"><img alt="Alan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alan">Alan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72497/#Comment_72497" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-29T16:18:43+00:00" title="May 29, 2007  4:18PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 29, 2007 4:28PM by Alan.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I want to add a few data points.<br>\n<br>\nYou'll see another thread on StoryGame about Traveller play by post. We've started collaborative worldbuilding and it struck me that each world can express a theme and/or issue that is suggested by the randomly generated world codes.

I remember this from my days playing too.

The World Builders' Handbook supplement for MegaTraveller combined the two of them (and lots of other stuff) to create a system that allowed you to roll up a whole lot of detail for a world, both physical and political/economic/cultural; it even had a system for rolling up random religions!

However, no matter how I parse "theme" I can't make sense of a statement implying that "learning and experience" are themes in Traveller.  There's no system for advancement in the game -- no learning or advancement takes place after character generation.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's what really drives a Traveller game -- the essence of the genre -- and Firefly fans will be familiar: the only way to be free is to have your own ship.  You can't afford a great ship.  The ship you can afford you owe money on for 20 more years and it's falling apart.  Traveller is about constantly making ends meet and doing whatever you have to to keep your head above water.  Payment's due and there's nothing but high volume, low-return cargo here except for that one shady Vargr who's willing to pay you triple a high passage ticket price to make two jumps with a stop in between.  You KNOW something's wrong but you need the money to stay free.  So you take a chance and the dilemmas begin to multiply.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's a reason why the most awesome "adventure" book in Traveller is a list of more than 70 people in three lines each who all want something done and will pay you for it.  It's because you need the money and you need it bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't know if that's what you mean by "theme" but it is what the game is about, and the reward mechanics are built into it not through metagame bennies but through in game needs being satisfied.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72656">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sydney%20Freedberg" title="Sydney Freedberg"><img alt="Sydney Freedberg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sydney%20Freedberg">Sydney Freedberg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72656/#Comment_72656" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-30T09:38:16+00:00" title="May 30, 2007  9:38AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, Traveller has to be about travelling.

It was well worth my time.  Some observations:<br/><br/>There are many places where holes are left for play-group infill.  It's transparently obvious that the initial game was set up to be generic (but tasty generic).  It's not "The Imperium" yet, it's "An Imperium".  No aliens - build your own!  They suggest RNA-modding memory, which is way outside later canon as far as I know.  There are big, obvious, welcoming blank spots. It's flavorful in its assumptions but loose in its implementation.<br/><br/>Character generation really is fun!  Their example (Jamison) is ridiculously, improbably lucky (four sixes in a row when mustering out!), which in itself speaks volumes about expectations.  The Army is the only service worth enlisting in, because you almost always get a commission and promotion.  Out of 24 characters, I got a Colonel, two Lieutenant Colonels and a Major, a Merchant Second Officer, a Navy Lieutenant and a Commander.  I also got a Scout who got a ship on mustering out and a Merchant with 110,000 credits.  Everybody else was either useless or dead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_73139">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73139/#Comment_73139" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-01T10:13:22+00:00" title="June  1, 2007 10:13AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 1, 2007 10:13AM by Brad_J_Murray.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: thor</cite><br/>I started reading the rules again at lunch today, and one of the things that struck me was that they assume that you will create story about your character from the rolls you get in character creation.

In fact in some ways the implied task resolution system in LBB Traveller feels related to Fate, not least because of the range of numbers (0-5 is bang on the Traveller skill range).  Because there is no general rule for task resolution but rather each skill has an example of its use and the players are expected to generalise for themselves, our Traveller games featured a great deal of negotiated skill application -- players would find a way to narrate their actions so as to use their Recon or Forward Observer or Leadership skill outside its stated application.  The dynamics of this play style really set us sup for SotC and the way Aspects are brought to bear.  I was surprised to realise that I'd been a hippy narration authority distributor since 1978 or so and didn't know it.<br/><br/>Anyway, it's certainly part of why our Spirit of the Far Future project seems to be working.

My intuition says there's something in the character generation system that addresses that. Of course, the process itself can be story building. However, I also think this process can be used to generate the backstory that builds up story elements (kickers, aspects, etc.?). <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm thinking this might be formalized by rules generate "descriptors" during character creation when certain rolls go certain ways. The obvious one is when a DM saves the character from death during a survival roll--that should be a significant background moment. By extension, anytime a DM makes the difference, it would generate a Descriptor. Enlistment automatically generates a descriptor of the service ("Army") and comission and promotion automatically generate rank descriptors. Failing reenlistment should also generate something I think. And And after Muster Out the player would have to explain how some event or decision threatens a  consequence the character must act upon (aka a Kicker). <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do descriptors do in play? Maybe they're simply like Sorcerer descriptors -- define how the character does what they do.<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: Oh yeah! I also wanted to comment that I think that the potential to create dead or lame characters is part of the charm I want to retain -- so I would not try to modify char gen towards more reliable creation of "good" characters. In fact, I think it's the strange juxtapositions of results that the system (and the world generation system) create that sparks the most creative ideas. Heck, I wonder if this generation of strange juxtapositions could be enhanced.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_73348">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Metal%20Fatigue" title="Metal Fatigue"><img alt="Metal Fatigue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://msen.com/~sethb/xkcd-sqrt-love.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Metal%20Fatigue">Metal Fatigue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73348/#Comment_73348" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-02T10:32:04+00:00" title="June  2, 2007 10:32AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alan</cite>I also wanted to comment that I think that the potential to create dead or lame characters is part of the charm I want to retain -- so I would not try to modify char gen towards more reliable creation of "good" characters.</blockquote>\nThen I think you need to add on significant metagame resources, or the players of the crap characters will be totally deprotagonized.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_73349">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73349/#Comment_73349" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-02T10:44:28+00:00" title="June  2, 2007 10:44AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think when I play this I will have the players make up 3-5 characters and choose their favorite.

Again, this retains some of the tension of the rolling character system, without dooming players to running characters they don't like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_73422">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ian%20Cooper" title="Ian Cooper"><img alt="Ian Cooper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/733/nRK18K7505XHK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ian%20Cooper">Ian Cooper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73422/#Comment_73422" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-03T06:23:44+00:00" title="June  3, 2007  6:23AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What's interesting to me is that I think Traveller has tried to awesomize itself several times:<br/><br/>Classic Traveller+: Let's add metaplot so folks have reasons for play, we'll start the Fifth Frontier War and introduce the Ancients.<br/>MegaTraveller: The Imperium is too big and does not have enough conflict away from its borders (hence Spinward Marches and Solomani Rim) - so let's have a  civil war that breaks it up into a collection of warring succession states.<br/>TNE: There is not enough room for exploration style adventures, so let's wipe the slate clean, so players can explore the universe anew; however, let's give them a mission too, to make creating scenarios easy.<br/>Milieu 0: Everyone hates Virus, let's have a post-Long Night setting so we get exploration, but without the plot device of virus.<br/>GURPS Traveller: Most people play a Free Traders game or  Star Mercs game, let's support those and dump all that metaplot rubbish that p***ed people off.<br/>The Interstellar Wars: Big conflict and exploration. Surely everyone is happy now.<br/><br/>The thing is that for my part 76 patrons, The Traveller Adventure, and Twighlight's Peak are Traveller. So to awesomify I would want something that supports that kind of play - a roving band of free traders with a ship who struggle to make ends meet, but get by on their wits or with a bit of luck. It's very pulp, crew of a tramp frieghter stuff. So for me anything that could awesomify that would work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_73453">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Larry" title="Larry"><img alt="Larry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Larry">Larry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73453/#Comment_73453" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-03T14:26:55+00:00" title="June  3, 2007  2:26PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 3, 2007 2:27PM by Larry.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I do think the "Imperium is just coming out of a dark age, and you have to go re-establish contact with long incommunicado worlds" thing they pulled no less than three times is still pretty hot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_73550">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sydney%20Freedberg" title="Sydney Freedberg"><img alt="Sydney Freedberg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sydney%20Freedberg">Sydney Freedberg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73550/#Comment_73550" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-04T07:57:29+00:00" title="June  4, 2007  7:57AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 4, 2007 7:56PM by Sydney Freedberg.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ian Cooper</cite>The Interstellar Wars: Big conflict and exploration.
