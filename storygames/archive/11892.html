Why would you NOT pick 1-8 or 2-7 between these two attributes, and simply describe every single thing you do in those terms (Magic guy does everything magically, Awesome guy does everything physically)?</blockquote>\nFor a few reasons. <br/><br/>First, doing the 1-8 combo is dangerous to your character. Anyone comes along and zaps that 1? You're toast. Same for the 2, although obviously harder to do. Basically, you better make damn sure you win all the time. Which doesn't happen.<br/><br/>Second, because it's powerfully boring. Ramping up Hubris ALL the time presupposes that you know how your Muses will go, and hence how your <i>story</i> will go. You're an All Magic, All the Time guy? Yawn. How do you already know, before any conflicts occur, that you want to challenge the gods? Maybe your character LIKES what they're trying to do. Why are you screwing up their reality again? (Of course, this also works in the reverse with Arete.) Also, why is your GM not messing with you more for doing this, making your character's life constantly complicated?<br/><br/>Third -- and related to <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> above -- how do you already know, before any conflicts are resolved, that you definitely want to always get Pride (instead of Valor)? You're definitely sure you always want Talismans? And, you never want to increase your attributes? (And vice versa the other route?)\n<blockquote>Realistically, I wouldn't game the system right out of the box in the above format, but I could see myself with a 6-3 split for my character between Arete and Hubris, then after a while start unconsciously falling into a trap where I simply start describing everything Arete-ly in order to use that higher stat ("because it is what my character would do"; and sure enough that's true!).

That's the thing that's missing from this on-the-face-of-it approach. You're front-loading not only the meaningful narrative impact of your Muses' resolutions, you're also preventing yourself from accessing half of the major reward cycles.<br/><br/>To be sure, the pull of that higher stat is strong. It obviously helps you in conflicts. You want to use it a lot. And, you probably DO use it a lot. Which is ok. But, it's a one-sided trap. It makes you a polarized type of character. It probably also makes you an effective character (as long as you low stat doesn't get you killed). And, all of that is ok, if that's the story you want to play. If it's not the story you want to play, diversify!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265580/#Comment_265580" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-05T09:08:06+00:00" title="April  5, 2010  9:08AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 5, 2010 9:08AM by Andy.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt Snyder</cite>Third -- and related to <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> above -- how do you already know, before any conflicts are resolved, that you definitely want to always get Pride (instead of Valor)?

I've given the choice between Arete and Hubris fictional teeth by taking the notion of resisting the will of the gods rather literally - the gods determine the natural laws of their worlds, breaking those laws and breaking the gods' will is the same thing and equals to breaking the law in a judicial sense). This is a pretty concrete thing socially, too: people who resist the gods will admire your Hubris, people who believe in the local god will despise your ways if you flout they way they want the world to be.<br/><br/>For instance, using magic on Earth, why is that a big deal? It's a big deal because every such act weakens Prometheus' veil. By doing magic (which on Earth means breaking the natural laws as understood by science) you're essentially saying that you do not approve of Prometheus' plan. Similarly, perhaps charity is magical in Mercury, the world of capitalism? The definition of what Arete and Hubris mean depends on what the local god thinks virtuous, as that worldview also determines the local natural law. In this view some sort of total choice between consistent Arete and consistent Hubris is no simple thing - you're not just saying that in this instance you oppose Zeus' authoritarianism, by having a high Hubris value you're saying that you stand against the power of the gods <i>on principle</i>. It doesn't matter what Zeus thinks, you're going to oppose him anyway. In fact, you're going to oppose every other god as well. The same unthinking fanaticism goes for unchallenged Arete as well: you're not deciding for yourself, you're just reflecting the gods' will. In this regard I'd say that for a real character it's impossible to think that you're going to "always" do the hubristic thing or always do the virtuous thing; if the character has values of his own at all, he's going to make choices that run counter to some gods while affirming others. The real, deeper choice in the end-game is whether there are <i>any</i> gods in the bunch worthy of worship, or at least service. Or similarly, whether you hate any of them enough to cast him down, for the hubristic ending.<br/><br/>To craft an example: your character is a seductress. When she seduces somebody on Venus, it's almost certainly going to be an Arete act. When she does the same on Mars, everybody's going to be all "Hey, what witchcraft is this!?!!" because the character, while being consistent in herself, is not consistent with the god's will. Only by shedding any sort of personal identity and becoming a mirror of the Primarch's in toto can a person who travels the worlds consistently choose Arete or Hubris. Thus your choices are simple as an Archon of the Nine Worlds:<ul>\n<li>Stay in one world and have an indentity of your own. This allows you to be strongly hubristic or virtuous all the time if you want, as the local laws don't change very quickly, if at all. If you're Apollo's favourite messenger boy, you're going to remain one as long as you're faithful to him, I should think.</li>\n<li>Travel the worlds and have an identity of your own. In practice you're going to have to use Hubris and Arete in different situations even if what you do is essentially the same all the time, because different places have different spec on what Hubris and Arete mean. So if you're going to be at all consistent in your actions, you'll be swinging between Hubris and Arete as the environment changes.</li>\n<li>Travel the worlds, but have no firm identity. In this case again you can rely exclusively on Hubris or Arete, as you don't really have any opinion for yourself on what to do. You can murder people for sport on Mars and join orgies on Venus, go deep into debt on Mercury and sacrifice your life for the state in Jupiter, always staying within the local understanding of what is virtuous behavior. This is what the gods would have you be. Alternatively, you can have a high Hubris and choose what your character does in every conflict with an eye on always using this stat, instead: in that case your character will always be going against whatever the local Primarch wants. Might as well join the Titans, in a way.</li>\n</ul>So as far as I understand this, I'd say that if your character is human and actually travels, you're going to be using both Hubris and Arete in different situations simply because the character as a person isn't willing to be the puppet of arbitrary ideological forces.<br/><br/>The really cool play comes in when you're all like "Hey, you can't seduce people with Arete in this world!" and then they go "Well, actually, I have a writ from Ares here says I can." After all, the Primarch decides what's Arete and what's Hubris, right? Mind-bending.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265597/#Comment_265597" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-05T10:06:24+00:00" title="April  5, 2010 10:06AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 5, 2010 10:06AM by Matt Snyder.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite><br/>Ah!

Or do I punch it with Magic?" ("Do I sneak past the guard? Or do I cast 'sneak magic' on myself... and sneak past the guard?"), and dismissed everything else as flowery dress-up.
