This will be the traditional game with all the trimmings, just the way we used to play back in the late 1970s, with all the fun and mayhem we're used to. I learned how to run these from Dave Wesley, back in the day, and I still run them the same way. I'll be setting the game in the world of Tekumel, and we'll have a lot of the new miniatures that are being produced by Howard Fielding and The Tekumel Project.<br/><br/>If you'd like to know what these are like to play in, ask Old Geezer. He played in my game "The Great Mos Eisley Spaceport Raid" as the dashing young hero Luke Skywalker, along with Dave Arneson as Jabba the Hutt, Dave Wesley as Boba Fett, Ross Maker as Greedo, and Fred Funk as the Imperial Stormtroopers. (There is no typecasting in these games. Really. Seriously. I mean it.) Game report and photos to follow...</blockquote>\nNote: I had a couple near-encounters with M.A.R. Barker while browsing in game shops in the Twin Cities. So I have a sentimental interest.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434005">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434005/#Comment_434005" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-18T08:02:05+00:00" title="June 18, 2014  8:02AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man, I wish I'd known about that game last summer!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/epweissengruber" title="epweissengruber"><img alt="epweissengruber" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/epweissengruber">epweissengruber</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434029/#Comment_434029" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-18T12:49:40+00:00" title="June 18, 2014 12:49PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Me three.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434031/#Comment_434031" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-18T13:37:51+00:00" title="June 18, 2014  1:37PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm very interested in this, too.

You don't need a staff of NPCs and rules marshals as the chosen game is readily used to handle those aspects of the event. It also doesn't involve much in the way of costuming and props as the focus is primarily on the game not roleplaying. <br/><br/>The other trick is to setup a scenario where goals lead the participants to both work together and to fight one another. Try to set it up so that their multiple choices for each individual. Pursue aspect A of your goal and you find yourself working with Faction A. Choose aspect b then Faction B is the logical choice.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435996">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chirinebakal" title="chirinebakal"><img alt="chirinebakal" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chirinebakal">chirinebakal</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435996/#Comment_435996" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-29T18:52:09+00:00" title="July 29, 2014  6:52PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote><a href="http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj719bjaTY2MnreQ0oKH9A" rel="nofollow">www.youtube.com/channel/UCj719bjaTY2MnreQ0oKH9A</a></blockquote>\n"This channel does not exist."</blockquote>\nSorry about that!

Would units that started across the table from one another ever meet, or would somewhat isolated fronts develop?</blockquote>\nGreat question! Let me see if I can't give you an answer of sorts...<br/><br/>Generally, the very first turn of the game takes about forty-five minutes to an hour, simply because the players need time to get used to the table, the miniatures, and the setting; I spend most of that time answering questions. The succeeding turns play much, much more quickly, and the turns usually come down to about fifteen to twenty minutes. I have a series of videos of an actual game up on my YouTube channel - this was the 'double-decker' underworld adventure, where the players had to coordinate teams of adventurers on both the surface board and the 'dungeon' board below it.<br/><br/>Yes, units routinely meet in the middle; I normally allow players to come on the board from any side that they want, unless there's a specific reason for them to start on the table. Every one of these I have run has the players all colliding on game turn two in various portions of the board; in the June game I use as my example, the fracas devolved into four separate <i><b>major</b></i> fights as people crashed into each other, and something like eight <i><b>minor</b></i> fights broke out as 'leakers' from the main fights were sent over to help other factions out as the results of the negotiations and bribery going on around the table.<br/><br/>As one of the players in that game noted, things went into Utter Chaos mode pretty much right away. And it got even more confused as the players all bribed, coerced, and persuaded the others to help them.<br/><br/>That's a Braunstein, for you... <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Does this help?<br/><br/>- chirine<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436154">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436154/#Comment_436154" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-01T07:34:05+00:00" title="August  1, 2014  7:34AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/78/grand-experiments-west-marches/" rel="nofollow">West Marches</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437339/#Comment_437339" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-15T07:35:25+00:00" title="August 15, 2014  7:35AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I leave for a couple months and come back to find Chirine has joined the party and people are jawing about Braunsteins!<br/><br/>Woo-hoo!<br/><br/>I've picked Chirine's brain about these games, and looked into similar stuff before, and talked with folks running these kinds of games ( although often not with the name Braunsteins).<br/><br/>There's actually a fair bit of stuff out there about these games, but you don't find it on RPG sites. You find it on war gaming sites.<br/><br/>On the downside, most of what is written about it is in terms of the nitty-gritty type rules associated with moving/shooting, etc.<br/><br/>What you don't see a whole lot of is analysis of the organizing play part or the running play part. Basically, the tips and tricks that get one of these things off the ground, building scenarios, and so on. The practical stuff.<br/><br/>Mostly I suspect that's because of the culture of minis war-gaming, especially the smaller, cottage industry stuff that parallels the indie RPG/SG scene in its niche.<br/><br/>I'm pretty well convinced that designers of systems for this sort of play are convinced ( rightly) that a discussion book of techniques and so on is a un-sellable product. Their audience is more<i> Just the Facts, Ma'am</i> types as it were, and the designers themselves have so internalized the upper level of necessary habits that they don't even think about writing them down!<br/><br/>Now me? I like the idea of Braunsteins, but as people who have read some of my [Minis+] posts here over time know, I want to take that concept and apply dirty-hippy techniques to it, and that too is a different sort of animal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chirinebakal" title="chirinebakal"><img alt="chirinebakal" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chirinebakal">chirinebakal</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437460/#Comment_437460" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-17T18:31:16+00:00" title="August 17, 2014  6:31PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I don't know if I've joined the party; I just drop by from time to time.<br/><br/>I like your points. In my experience, most RPG people don't seem to be able to 'get' Braunsteins because they don;t have a lot of rules - game mechanics seem to have trumped play style, if I may make such a generalization. 'War gamers' seem to be able to handle the "hand waving" and "loosey-goosey" playstyle more easily, which I think may be because of the tradition of 'free Kreigspiel' and 'skirmish gaming' that us old guys used to do. (Some us still do it, in deep dark secret places where no mortal fears to tread...)<br/><br/>I am intrigued at your thoughts on a booklet or other publication that talks about this kind of gaming. Is this the kind of thing I've been addressing on my little blog with my posts on Braunsteins? I agree with you about the internalization - I do these kinds of games more or less instinctively, I think, and really should write more about this arcane ritual behavior so it is preserved for the ages... <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Seriously, how can I help?

That does seem to be "generational". I think that the perception of wargamers is just the opposite, namely that they are rules sticklers to the Nth degree.<br/><br/>Which is of course true, among a certain subset of minis wargamers. It does happen to be the subset that is producing commercially successful/popular rulesets, or at least the players of those sets. So that's the vibe people tend to run into, as those are most frequently encountered.<br/><br/>Around here though, and at related sites, a big movement is to examine "what is <i>really</i> going on" during play of a game. <br/><br/>Then, once you understand that, go back and <b>write that process up as the rules</b>.<br/><br/>Now, a lot of "what is really going on" tends to get skipped or thrown in the advice section. That's the internalized stuff that makes play actually functional. And that's waaaay more important than the stuff we think of as the important mechanics, like our system for moving or shooting or whatever.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437475">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437475/#Comment_437475" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-18T07:23:56+00:00" title="August 18, 2014  7:23AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To follow up on that, I'm going to continue to pick your brain on some practicalities of making and running a Braunstein as we go along in this thread.<br/><br/>If I personally had some way to create a book about Braunsteins or other use of minis in gaming, and wanted to direct to interested non-minis users, and wanted to talk about something really important, internalized and not discussed, the single biggest, most important part in my opinion...<br/><br/>...<i>The joys of using miniatures</i>.<br/><br/>I know, right?

It's pretty much completely absent.<br/><br/>And without that part, almost nothing else about Braunsteins or any other sort of imaginative game with miniatures will ever make sense to them.

Let me see what I can do, here...<br/><br/>I think the process starts with something triggering my imagination. It could be a post on one of the blogs I follow, it coule be a news story, it could be something I've written in my book about gaming with Phil ("To Serve The Petal Throne"), it could be a new miniature I just got in, it could be a browse through the pet store and finding some really cool bit that I can use as scenery in a game, it could be finding something on the shelves in the game room that I haven't seen if a while. I start to think, and to dream. I get the notion that this what-ever-it-is might be the basis of a fun game, and off I go. For example:<br/><br/>A long time ago, and far, far away; Dave Arneson took a trip to the Yucatan, and brought me back a pair of cheap resin book-ends as a gift. These bookends are very nice bookends, and work quite well in their intended design function. I've never, ever used them the way they were intended to be used - they are in the shape of Mayan temples, and just the right size and scale for use with 25mm miniature figures...<br/><br/>A long time ago, and far, far away; Prof. Barker showed me his first edition copy of Catherwood's book on Mayan architecture. This has all of the drawings of the Maya temples in their overgrown state, and just screamed "ADVENTURE!!!'" to me...<br/><br/>So, out came the boxes of jungle scenery (in my mind; I have a habit of keeping a sort of visual inventory of my gaming stuff in my head), and pretty soon I had a trackless jungle that just cried out for an adventure to have happen. I cam to my first fork in the train: party of adventurers up against some Nameless Peril in search of Something (your classic RPG-style of thing), or multiple parties all wandering through the jungle in search of Something and bumping into each other (the classic Braunstein approach). My choice of path depends on the presumes number of players and their likes / dislikes; I try to provide a fun time for everyone. In this case, it's the latter path I chose, and so went off to the miniatures shelves to recruit some factions / teams / warbands for each player to run.<br/><br/>Oh, and I have to come up with the Something, too. What could all the players be after that's worth slogging through swamps and bogs and jungles to get to the Lost Temple Of The Sacred Bookends? In this particular case, it was the possible ransom money represented by a pair of shipwrecked castaways. And so, the game "Saving Serqu's Sisters" was born.<br/><br/>Now, I think that back in the day we were doing what might be considered 'Story Games'; the referree / GM would come up with a plot line / story arc / back story to give us players our motivations for the game - why, being presumably smart people, oh why would we be slogging through some swamp, fighting enemy tanks in the North African desert, piloting our rickety biplanes over no-man's land, fighting Imperial Storm troopers in the corridors of the Death Star?<br/><br/>Because we were <i><b>motivated</b></i>. We all had a reason for doing what we were doing. We got some idea of the 'why' from the person running the game, and being all pretty smart and clever folks - people like Dave Arneson, Ross Maker, Dave Wesley, Fred Funk, Greg Swenson, M. A. R. Barker, and other folks you may have heard of - we tended to take the bits we got from the basic scenario information and run with it. We players provided a lot of the 'backstory' for every game, as our imaginations would fill in the blanks that were there.<br/><br/>"We made stuff up, and we had fun." - Dave Arneson<br/><br/>Does this even begin to address your question? Or am I making it sound like some sort of mystic rite that can only be learned through years of study in some dank cave someplace?<br/><br/>- chirine                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437540">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437540/#Comment_437540" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-20T06:59:22+00:00" title="August 20, 2014  6:59AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chirine, <br/><br/>What would it take to get a game together with you?

Which, of course means some of this is highly suspect, but it is what it is.<br/><br/>I usually start with these elements:<br/>1) A look over what I already own in minis and terrain.<br/>2) Stuff I've seen online that I've been drooling over, but haven't had an excuse to buy (like a minis gamer needs something else...)<br/>3) Some bit of media inspiration, a snippet of conversation, even a one off, tossed out line by someone else.<br/>4) An urge to combine some commonly known property with some other commonly known property or genre, in a bad B-Movie fashion<br/>5) Somewhere...dumb humor, generally, although not always, comes into play<br/><br/>Notably, mechanics are waaay down the list of things that I concern myself with at all. Mostly because they tend to be a mishmash of stuff stolen from other systems, and are often purpose crash-built as needed for the specific scenario/presentation game I have cooking. <br/><br/>Which generally also means they need to be pretty simple.<br/><br/>It also means they tend to be fairly untested. The game when played <b>is</b> the alpha test.<br/><br/>A couple of examples:<br/><b>Los Ochos Diablos Rojos de Juarez y la Maladicion de Drakula</b>( The 8 Red Devils of Juarez and the Curse of Dracula)<br/><br/>Physical inspiration: I had a big Dracula's castle model and a bunch of vamps and werewolves, plus some banditos with a red paint theme, some Mexican villagers, old west town bits, a graveyard, and some Mexican Revolution era Mexican army troops.<br/><br/>Media Inspiration: I'd seen a bunch of Mexican b-movie videos for sale at a store where all kinds of sf/horror elements were combined with stuff like superhero luchadores. Why not?<br/><br/><b>The Venusian Natives are Restless!</b><br/>Physical: I had a bunch of Victrian Era/Space 1889 minis and plastic D&amp;D lizardmen/kobolds/troglodytes. The FLGS had a cool jungle temple, native (goblin) village, and jungle terrain. I bought some plastic toy dinosaurs.<br/><br/>Media: Mostly just the Space 1889 setting itself, plus a model of Lettow-Vorbeck I'd painted because-hey, Lettow-Vorbeck!<br/><br/><b>A very fishy Halloween, Scooby Doo!</b><br/>Physical: I'd just finished painting a big, reaper bones Cthulhu. I'd seen some not-Scooby gang minis for sale. I had a fair bit of 20C terrain already for gangster gaming.<br/><br/>Media: Scooby Doo meets Cthulhu and Deep Ones at a Halloween Beach Party in Innsmouth. What more can you ask for? It goes together like Peanut Butter and Jelly really.<br/><br/>After that basic kind of thing, I go back and try to figure out all kinds of related possibilities for events/side characters and possible factions.<br/><br/>I actually only then figure out the number of players (min/max) I want to involve.<br/><br/>Then I start doing some budgeting/buying/building and some test layouts, which can take a while.<br/><br/>Only then do I really begin to think about mechanics.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437568">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chirinebakal" title="chirinebakal"><img alt="chirinebakal" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chirinebakal">chirinebakal</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437568/#Comment_437568" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-20T18:28:38+00:00" title="August 20, 2014  6:28PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            @ Christopher:<br/><br/>I have game sessions here at the house every month, on the second and fourth Saturdays of each month.

I do the basic set up fiction background, stuff that everyone can know. Really, usually a paragraph that gives the title and the main concept, and introduce a few pregens.<br/><br/>I usually also think in terms of how I can introduce other characters on the fly, either because of more people showing up and/or joining during play or in case a character gets dead. It's important to me that every real person has something to do throughout the whole play time.<br/><br/>How do you approach this sort of thing?<br/><br/><br/>Do you ever have problems where, because of starting positions, characters may end up not interacting? How do you deal with this, either in initial set up or other mechanics for movement/repositioning? For example, do you ever give a player multiple characters/henchmen that are not in a group, but spread somewhat in different locations, simply so that a single player always has a way to interact with other players' characters/henchmen?<br/><br/>Have you ever experimented with rules/mechanics where there's a stop in play and repositioning opportunities?<br/><br/>I'm thinking of a situation where you say something like ( after 3 full goes around the table), " So, okay, two days pass uneventfully in Deadwood. Where are your characters now, and what are they doing currently?" Basically, a resetting up of character positions around the table for another chunk of play, leading off the earlier part of play.<br/><br/>Do you ever use <i>Variable Length Bounds</i>? This is a term I've heard some wargamers use. Basically, it's like narrated, time-skipping movement in RPGs, a bit like the last paragraph. Instead of "figure moves this far each turn, which represents this amount of time blahblahblah", it's more like...it represents <i>some</i> unknown amount of time, passing on until something relevant happens and you go to more fine grained, tactical stuff as needed.<br/><br/>Terrible description, I know. I'll give an example later if that's not clear. Mostly, I just want to know how that works in practice with multiple, competing players, whose faction actions may be of different durations by their description of activities.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437578/#Comment_437578" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-20T22:30:23+00:00" title="August 20, 2014 10:30PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Do you ever work real-world passage of time into the mechanics?<br/><br/>Example: After 2 hours of play have passed, event Z is announced and the dinosaurs arrive in a herd chased by a pack of T-Rexes.<br/><br/>That sort of thing?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chirinebakal" title="chirinebakal"><img alt="chirinebakal" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chirinebakal">chirinebakal</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437612/#Comment_437612" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-21T17:50:49+00:00" title="August 21, 2014  5:50PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right! Let me take your points in order, if I may...<br/><br/>I do what you do - I have a number of 'starting players' / factions, and I keep some extras in reserve in case somebody shows up during the game. 'New arrivals' always throw things for a loop, and the players seem to love it. Always have something in reserve - you'll never need it if you do, but you'll always need it if you don't.<br/><br/>I have yet to have players not interact; they always seem to crash into each other on the first turn or two. I have not had to have 'split parties', but it's a good thing to have as a GM tool - great idea, there, and I'll just add it to my tool box of you wouldn't mind. Likewise, I've never had to stop and reposition / restart; it hasn't been an issue with my usual suspects. On the other hand, I'd feel free to use it - GM fiat, as it were.<br/><br/>I think we may run a version of the variable bound, but not as such. We run the 'turn order': all movement, then all missile fire, then all melee, all magic, and then any other actions as needed. Time is elastic; about the only thing I enforce are limits to movement turns, using the sandglasses, so as to put the pressure or 'real time decision-making' on the players and to keep the dithering to a bare minimum. I do limit the moves to the stated rate, but again, I can be flexible if somebody has a really good idea that they want to try. The rest of the players usually heartily approve of this, as it tends to result in the player with the Bright Idea getting into a lot of trouble and with much hilarity as the result.<br/><br/>I wing it. I think that's the beauty of the format; you can wing the game mechanics in favor of having a good time, and not really go wrong.<br/><br/>Yes, I do watch the clock; I have several in view in my game room, and I carry portable ones to games as needed. I do exactly what you mention - at a certain point, the volcano erupts. You can also do that with dice rolls or event cards, but I like to use the clock - it makes the event seem just as random to the players, and it's much more of a surprise when it happens.<br/><br/>By the way, would it be all right if I quoted these exchanges on my blog, as part of my series of posts about Braunsteins? I won;t do it without your approval, of course. I just find this conversation fascinating!!!<br/><br/>- chirine                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437613/#Comment_437613" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-21T17:55:08+00:00" title="August 21, 2014  5:55PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Quote away!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437624/#Comment_437624" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-22T06:50:17+00:00" title="August 22, 2014  6:50AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, so more questions:<br/><br/>1) Do you make sure, if using a big-ish table that movement mechanics will allow characters pretty free movement if they choose to do so, across the whole board? Do you ever run into conflict between this and other mechanics, like tactical movement/shooting/communication distance?<br/><br/>1a) If you ever have problems with that stuff that would be an issue on a blank board, do you work in some kinds of terrain cheats or vehicle access to get around those problems?<br/><br/>Those last questions may seem odd to both you and other readers following along. Sorry, they're a bit more nitty-gritty, in-play technical questions rather than organizational ones. I'll try to explain. I wish all of you were at my house, then I could just set out a table of stuff and explain more easily.<br/><br/>Let's say we have  a scenario where the table space represents big area.  <br/>Examples:<br/>1)A section of frontier with a village and some countryside wild space, as some ruins and other bits of interest.<br/>2)A pulp era city, with dockland, a downtown area with a bank, a robber baron's mansion, two rival speakeasies in two competing gangs' turf.<br/><br/>As the set up designer, I want local action, but I also want movement around the space as a whole. OTOH, I don't want local actions too badly overflowing some discrete "areas".<br/><br/>What can I do to mitigate some of those conflicting wants on my part?<br/>If I keep ranges-of-action low ( but relative), I may never get certain factions interacting officially. I mean shooting and moving ranges here, maybe also communication. If I make them longer, then I start risking too much spill over.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437626">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437626/#Comment_437626" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-22T06:58:59+00:00" title="August 22, 2014  6:58AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A couple of more organizational level questions:<br/><br/>2) How much do you shoot right for the obvious ( to you) stuff in a scenario? The really clich\xe9 stuff or genre expectations.<br/><br/>I personally try to start with as much cliche as possible, then assume that players will either run with it or twist as they see fit. That kinda flows through the whole design, including events and so on. I work on the idea that half the fun for the players is that you are messing around with stuff you already know. If you're on prehistoric planet, then any number of things from various dino movies should be in the works if you're doing this right. There's gonna be a T-Rex popping up. There will be an herbivore stampede. Crossing large bodies of water <b>will</b> have some sort of scary water lizard showing up.<br/><br/>3) In what way do you prime the players ahead of time for the scenario? Do you suggest stuff to watch, point them to online links, or send them email with info? What if it's a RPG based setting, like Tekumel, where you may have players unfamiliar with the setting? Or do you invite players very selectively based on how you think they'll jump into the thing with their own prior knowledge?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437629">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437629/#Comment_437629" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-22T07:35:37+00:00" title="August 22, 2014  7:35AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 23, 2014 6:17AM by komradebob.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just some general thoughts for topic headings, before I start being responsible today...<br/><br/>1) Keep your first Braunstein simple, mechanically, in terms of faction interaction, and background<br/>2) Selectively adding complexity to make a given Braunstein unique.<br/>3) <i>Every</i> Braunstein is an experiment and a Work-in-Progress, and the implications of this.<br/>4) Braunsteins (benefit/run on a fuel of) clich\xe9s/genre expectations and the warping of the same<br/>5) 90%+ of the in-play action in a Braunstein is about what the players are doing with their characters.

Let me answer your questions from your previous posts, if I may:<br/><br/>1) I don't try to limit the players' interactions in the game - I can't anyway, so I don;t worry about it. What I can do is to facilitate them, and one of the ways to address this issue is to provide 'mobility chokepoints' (like bridges) or 'attractive nuisances' (like the First National bank of Mos Eisely, in the Great Mos Eisely Spaceport Raid game); if you give players a reason to crash into and interact with each other, they will. Buckle your safety belt and hang on - they will take it and run with it, in my experience!<br/><br/>2)Yes. I do the same thing. It's funnier that way. I do explain things to people as needed, but I do kinda expect that the players will know something about F/SF, like in my "Star Wars" games.<br/><br/>3) I try very hard to direct players - especially new ones - to any on-line resources I can about the subject / scenario of the game. However, having said that, I also emphasize that NO experience is required to play in any of my games. I will always tell you what you would know 'in-game', and had you a quick 'cheat sheet' if at all possible. I do not 'preselect' for experience; I try to include as many as want to play, and I feel that it's my job as the referee / GM / ringmaster to have a game that they will find fun and exciting.<br/><br/>I'll have a look at the link, too! Thank you!<br/><br/>- chirine                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
