Unlike the new Gamma World or Warhammer Fantasy games, White Wolf had gone with smaller boxes more like Everway or <a href="http://sales.starcitygames.com/cardscans/MAGBOX/4ED_GiftBox.jpg" rel="nofollow">the original "gift sets" for Magic: The Gathering</a> (wow, that takes me back). Slightly smaller than the Freemarket box.<br/><br/>Plus, rather than having a single set for the entire game, White Wolf had a different box set for each "splat" in the game, each school of witchcraft that your character could be part of.  Basically, you bought a boxed set to play a specific type of character and the game included solo or 1-on-1 rules so you could create and play a witch of that particular type either on your own or with a friend playing a very structured GM role (like playing the monsters in the new Castle Ravenloft).  So it was like a cross between an Apocalypse World playbook and a stand-alone solo RPG boardgame.<br/><br/>Ideally, after doing some solo or 1-on-1 adventuring on your own, you could get some friends together, each of whom would have their own boxed set (perhaps of a different witch type) or you could all play out of the same box as members of the same clan of witches.  Then you would have a multi-player game, with one player serving as a combined GM for everyone else.  This wasn't in the dream but it strikes me that maybe the GM could have rules for playing out what the antagonists do off-screen, so they could have solo adventures on the side as well.<br/><br/>In any event, the witch types in the dream had really crazy White Wolf-y names:<br/>-- Protectae<br/>-- Swamp Misers<br/>-- Gorgorath<br/>-- Fabula<br/>-- etc.<br/><br/>It was impossible to tell from the boxes what time period the game was set in, though I have an intuition that maybe it was set in the future, like Blade Runner-esque or on the verge of some environmental or resource-based apocalypse.  The art on the boxes reminded me of <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/2666.jpg" rel="nofollow">the cover to the novel "2666"</a>, sections of fine art paintings with design elements layered on top, but the design work was mostly pretty terrible.  Here's a mockup of what one of the box covers looked like in the dream:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://plays-well.com/protectae.jpg" width="350"/><br/><br/>Now, if only I could remember what the game was called.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310139">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310139/#Comment_310139" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-29T11:03:06+00:00" title="January 29, 2011 11:03AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh yeah, and resolution and character creation was totally card-based.  The game came with a few booklets, but most of the materials were printed on various sets of cards that were arrayed in little groups like <a href="http://www.libermortis.co.uk/site/dominion-card-game/large-dominion-card-game.png" rel="nofollow">the inside of the Dominion box</a>. The cards probably also contained plots and antagonists and locations and the like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_310143">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310143/#Comment_310143" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-29T11:44:22+00:00" title="January 29, 2011 11:44AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's an awesome dream.
