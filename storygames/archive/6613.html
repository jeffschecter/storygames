But rather than do a standard Spirit Pulps game, I decided to run something near and dear to my heart a Post-Apocalyptic game. <br/>\n<br/>\nI also knew the main type of Post-Apocalyptic genre I wanted to emulate and that was the mad genius of 70's Post-Apocalyptic Comic Books.  Kamandi, Killraven, Sabre, and Thundarr the Barbarian. Armies of Jack Kirby inspired Animal Men on Horseback would ride across the ruined landscape. National Monuments would still be recognizable underneath ages of ruin and neglect. Mutants, Sorcerers, Monsters, Aliens, and High Technology would mix together on a madhouse planet where man was no longer alone and no longer the dominant species.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter brainstorming and researching I felt I had a pretty good handle on The Shattered Earth which is what I named my setting. Now I had to come up with characters, which was probably my biggest pre-game challenge. Most of my research and source material had pretty rocking characters so I liberally stole and mashed up some of my favorite Post-Apocalyptic heroes into six PCs for the convention. Now these were going to be 4/5ths completed character sheets only two adventures to flesh out and guest star in and two aspects to choose. It really gets people into their characters and familiar with the Spirit of the Century aspects.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146791">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mcellis" title="mcellis"><img alt="mcellis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mcellis">mcellis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146791/#Comment_146791" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-30T00:04:21+00:00" title="May 30, 2008 12:04AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 30, 2008 12:06AM by mcellis.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Bunker the Boy of the Apocalypse</b><br/><br/>No question Kamandi was one of the biggest influences on this game. So I knew I wanted a boy raised in an ancient underground government complex and now exploring the strangeness of the Shattered Earth with wide eyed enthusiasm. After a few discussions with Steerpike and given SotC great social combat system I knew I could make a character who would be just as effective with his words as with his fists and so Bunker the Boy of the Apocalypse was born.<br/><br/>Aspects:<br/>Fallout-Sheltered Upbringing<br/>Disk Book Learning<br/>Vault Dweller<br/>So Darned Likable!<br/>Government Training Manuals<br/>My Enemy can be My Friend<br/>Hidden Resource Caches<br/>Slippery Little Devil<br/><br/>Key Skills: <br/>Rapport, Engineering, Resources<br/><br/><b>Tex the Robot Gunslinger</b><br/><br/>One of the first character ideas I had was for a Gunslinger dressed in black wandering the wastes and righting wrongs. But how to get a western character into the setting? Answer a Robotic Gunslinger! A robot left over from some sort of Westworld type amusement park seemed like the perfect origin to borrow.<br/><br/>Aspects:<br/>Amusement Park Android<br/>Android in Black<br/>Have Gun Will Travel<br/>Trusty Robo-Steed Rusty<br/>Reach for it Mister!<br/>The Law of the West<br/>Fastest Co-Processor in the West<br/>Fistful of Data<br/><br/>Key Skills:<br/>Guns, Intimidation, Endurance<br/><br/><b>Bengal the Lion Man</b><br/><br/>Now being a Post-Apocalyptic Media Junkie I love Mad Max, but it was a little bit outside the 70's Comic Book style I was going for. So how to make him fit? Well the answer was to make him some sort of animal man since I already had decided to make at least one. A Lion or Tiger man was the image that popped into my head, so where do Road Warrior style Lions in post-apocalyptic muscle cars come from? Detroit of course. And since I wanted a mixture of Lion and Tiger features I went with the name Bengal the Lion Man.<br/><br/>Aspects:<br/>Motor City Kitty<br/>Gearhead<br/>Road Ranger<br/>Leadfoot<br/>White Line Nightmare<br/>Custom V8 Interceptor<br/>Savage Beastman<br/>King of the Black Top Jungle<br/><br/>Key Skills:<br/>Drive, Alertness, Might<br/><br/>My next three characters were heavily inspired by Thundarr the Barbarian but they also had a fair mix of other characters, mainly Killraven and his Freemen from Marvel's War of the Worlds comics added to them as I didn't want the Thundarr serial numbers to show up too easily.<br/><br/><b>Thunderhawk the Freeman</b> <br/><br/>Thunderhawk the Freeman was a human barbarian whose people, the Americans had settled into a nomadic tribal life in the Northern plains of Montana, Wyoming, and the Dakotas. I placed them there mainly because I wanted Mt. Rushmore to be a part of the culture of Thunderhawk's people. Throwing in some inter-dimensional alien invaders to round out his background and explain the existence of his fireblade and he was good to go.<br/><br/>Aspects:<br/>By the Founding Forefathers!<br/>Barbarian Warrior<br/>I am a Free Man!<br/>His Fantastic Fireblade<br/>Noble Savage<br/>Freedom Fighter<br/>My People will be Avenged!<br/>Free Running<br/><br/>Key Skills:<br/>Athletics, Resolve, Weapons<br/><br/><b>Gorlla the Mighty Crorc</b><br/><br/>Some sort of big monstrous mutant was on my list next, adding in some Gladiatorial combat and freaky powers seemed like a winning combo and so I came up with Gorlla the Mighty Crorc. What's a Crorc? You might ask. Basically it's a mixture of Human, Crocodile, Gorilla, Orc, and some Electric Eel just for fun. Now I wanted a tortured arena slave so chains, strange weapons, and alien experimentation lead to some nifty aspects, weapons and background.<br/><br/>Aspects:<br/>Massive Brute of a Crorc<br/>Trained for the Arena<br/>Ex-Gladiator<br/>I Broke my own Bonds!<br/>Shocking Power<br/>Extraordinary Electro-Mace<br/>Soul of a Child<br/>Metal-Scaled Hide<br/><br/>Key Skills<br/>Might, Endurance, Weapons<br/><br/><b>Kallista the Amazon Sorceress</b><br/><br/>Finally rounding out the cast of PCs and again riffing off of Thundarr I felt I needed some sorcery, I also wanted at least one female character. But I also wanted some kung fu action so I went a little Jedi giving her amazing telekinetic powers and training at a martial arts temple. Then to finally round out the character I went with an Amazon and Prophetic culture. All these elements made up Kallista the Amazon Sorceress.<br/><br/>Aspects:<br/>Child of Prophecy<br/>Raised in the Amazon Temple<br/>The Dance of Durga<br/>Wind of the Mind<br/>Great Mother grant me Strength!<br/>The Stars do not control my Destiny<br/>My Wind has become a Storm<br/>I am Better than any Man!<br/><br/>Key Skills:<br/>Mysteries, Athletics, Fists                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146792">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146792/#Comment_146792" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-30T00:16:04+00:00" title="May 30, 2008 12:16AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 30, 2008 12:27AM by noclue.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And the setting was awesome with characters made of pure win!

And where else could I ride my Massive Hexapedal Lizard Mount "Sparky"? <br/><br/>Another thing I thought was nifty was how you fit the narrative into the settting. We chose a monument, the St. Louis Arch. And you were able to adapt that into the setting. St. Louis was on an inland sea and called "Water lou" where we were beset by Napoleon and his army of cannibalistic pig men.

There is no map. <br><br>Or at least there wasn't when I first started developing The Shattered Earth. In the creation of the characters the map got filled in a little. D-Troyt the Motor City and home of the Lion men came from Bengal. Thunderhawk's people were watched over by the Great Stone Founding Forefathers of Mt. Rushmore, and one of his Comics had him going to the wicked and decadent city of Den Ver on the western shore of the Inland sea.<br/><br/>And that was all I had planned out. Mt Rushmore was still standing, Detroit was still making cars, and Denver was on the shore of an inland sea. Not much of a map to start with, but there you go James.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mcellis" title="mcellis"><img alt="mcellis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mcellis">mcellis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146905/#Comment_146905" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-30T12:11:58+00:00" title="May 30, 2008 12:11PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But the whole map/world creation is getting a bit ahead of things. So getting back to finishing up character creation. Rather than the traditional SotC phases I went with Comic Book Issues. Origin Issue, First Appearance, Solo Issue, and then two Team Up Issues. I filled in the titles, backgrounds, and aspects for the first three phases and then only the title and aspects for the fourth phase and then left the last phase completely blank. <br/><br/>The players then filled in the events of phase four to match their aspects, and then handed in the sheets. I mixed them up and passed them out to my players at random, they wrote down that title and got the gist of events and then got there own sheets back to write down their guest appearance and come up with their last two aspects. I got lots of goodness from the player\u2019s new aspects a few that were really memorable like Jame's Hexapedal Lizard Mount, and Oh Godess not another Evil Sorcerer!<br/><br/>This part was perhaps a bit confusing to folks unused to SotC character creation, but it helped make connections between the PCs and helped them get a handle on Aspects. In the future I\u2019m going to try to explain it better and make it clearer on the character sheet especially for new players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WillH" title="WillH"><img alt="WillH" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v488/Telpierion/minitardisicon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WillH">WillH</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146908/#Comment_146908" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-30T12:38:02+00:00" title="May 30, 2008 12:38PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 30, 2008 1:12PM by WillH.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: mcellis</cite>Will that is a very good guess.

I then go around the table asking the players two things. What do you look like? And what are you riding across the wasteland? <br/><br/>One thing that I hadn\u2019t consciously planned on was describing things as comic book panels. But it came up early in my first game and it really helped to capture the feel I was going for so I kept doing it. So the players have given their descriptions and now it\u2019s time to start the game. I know for Spirit of the Century the advice it to start with a Compel but for The Shattered Earth you start with a Monument.<br/><br/>Our heroes riding across the wasteland of the Shattered Earth come over a rise and then a full page panel reveals a National Monument. Then the players threw out some suggestions eventually one calls out to you or your group and you chose that one. In the two games I ran we ended up with the St Louis Arch and the Hoover Dam.<br/><br/>Now you\u2019ve got the Monument all you have to do is make it post-apocalyptic. So for St. Louis I knew there was an inland sea out there with Denver on its western shore. How far east would it go? Then the image of the Arch with its base underwater told me exactly how far, St. Louis. A rough and ready shady merchant and pirate port seemed like the most fun so there were now all sorts of ships and boats sailing under the Arch.<br/><br/>For the Hoover Dam I was getting the handle on running the game better, so I left it to the players to help me make things Post-Apocalyptic. Was the Dam intact? No, it\u2019s got a big crack in it. So a cracked Hoover Dam with the water long since drained out of Lake Mead. I asked for some aspects and my players delivered, <b>Giant Wind Turbines</b> jutting from canyon walls powering <b>Ancient Generators</b> and a <b>Hang-Gliding Militia</b>, pure post-apocalyptic gold! And since it came from the players it allowed them to throw their hooks into the setting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146928">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146928/#Comment_146928" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-30T15:26:02+00:00" title="May 30, 2008  3:26PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why 5 male characters and 1 female character?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146931">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike" title="Steerpike"><img alt="Steerpike" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/73053145/4961238"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike">Steerpike</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146931/#Comment_146931" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-30T15:51:42+00:00" title="May 30, 2008  3:51PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: mcellis</cite>For the Hoover Dam I was getting the handle on running the game better, so I left it to the players to help me make things Post-Apocalyptic.

Making the players tell you what is going to be in the game and then adding setting aspects is a great way of comunicating to the table to make this their own.

Now granted I didn't get any female players for either of these two games, but I wanted to have that as an option for players.<br/><br/>Thirdly most of the inspirational material features male protagonists so as I was creating characters <br/>most of the ideas were for men or at least male characters. I would have had no problem with any of the characters gender being switched by players. Bunker the Girl of the Apocalypse doesn't alliterate as well, but it still sounds like a rocking character to me.<br/><br/>Lastly because I was lazy. I have several other character ideas and some of them are female but I was pressed for time and didn't get them written up in time for the con. I went with the ones that seemed easiest to write up (aka the ones for which I had the most Aspects). The next time I run Spirit of the Shattered Earth I'm definitely going to have more than 6 pre-gens and several of them will be female. Including one of my favorites Lt. Col. Wilma Stewart the Ancient Astronaut.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146934">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mcellis" title="mcellis"><img alt="mcellis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mcellis">mcellis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146934/#Comment_146934" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-30T16:18:43+00:00" title="May 30, 2008  4:18PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: tomg</cite>this is way awesome!!

The players now get to choose the problem that is confronting the town. So why are you here? What\u2019s the problem? For the St. Louis game it was <b>Mutant Cannibal Raiders</b> and <b>Yet Another Evil Sorcerer</b>. Referring to my list of potential encounters right at the top was Napoleon and his army of Boar and Pig men soldiers. For sorcerers I had the Fire Witch. <br/><br/>In the Hoover Dam game the Menace was <b>Cannibal Vegan Troublemakers</b>. For some reason Cannibalism seemed to be a recurring theme for the bad guys. Also Vegan in this case referred to Los Vegas. Again looking at my list of potential encounters Nero the Lizardman Emperor and the idea of the Lizardmen of Vegas was put on the stove and left to simmer. I also wanted a goal rather than just a simple confrontation so I added in <b>Stolen Power Converter</b> as a McGuffin style aspect. Which I\u2019ll admit was mainly a way to get the players to go to Vegas.<br/><br/>Now having a list of possible adversaries was one cheat that I allowed myself though usually it wasn\u2019t much more than a name and perhaps a line of description. I also had a list of some possible monstrous encounters, environmental hazards, and cultural plot ideas. But I really let my players decide the Menace and then I just went down the list until something leaped of the page or seemed to fit right.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147064">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mcellis" title="mcellis"><img alt="mcellis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mcellis">mcellis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147064/#Comment_147064" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-01T02:11:25+00:00" title="June  1, 2008  2:11AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Then you have to fit the Menace into the Settlement/Monument and the created situation, usually it\u2019s as easy as having the Menace attacking the settlement, but if you want to get more detailed you can really let the collectively created situation and menace come together. <br/><br/>For the St. Louis group I hadn\u2019t quite gotten into the swing of things and so the players were pretty much told that the Boar General Napoleon was raiding up the great river and that he was sweeping towards St. Louis, and being the great heroes of the wasteland that they were they rode out to put a stop to Napoleon\u2019s advance. <br/><br/>For the Hoover Dam group I gave them a short skirmish with the Vegan Troublemakers, Nero\u2019s legion of red scaled velociraptor-like Vegan lizardmen dressed in full Roman Legionary gear marching on the settlement in a tortoise formation. After some quick action by the players the Vegan\u2019s were routed. There was also some player added color of having the Vegan\u2019s shields being made out of Las Vegas advertisement signs and other casino detritus. This was a really nice PA touch and gave no question as to the Vegan\u2019s home base.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147066">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tomg" title="tomg"><img alt="tomg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://tomgurg.googlepages.com/tinyrobot1.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tomg">tomg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147066/#Comment_147066" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-01T04:45:01+00:00" title="June  1, 2008  4:45AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            DANG!

Pig and Boar men decked out in the uniforms of the French Revolution and armed with muskets and napoleon cannons suddenly encountered Bengal\u2019s <b>Custom V8 Interceptor</b>, as it roared through the ranks along with Bunker. Gorlla on his <b>Hexapedal Lizard Mount \u2018Sparky\u2019</b> charged the rest of the line swinging his <b>Extraordinary Electro-Mace</b> into the flanks and causing Napoleon\u2019s troops to pick up the consequence <b>A Whiff of Bacon</b>.<br/><br/>Kallista beginning her sorcerous duel with the Fire Witch, telekinetically brought down the thunderstorm and added <b>Their Power\u2019s Wet</b> to the Pig men\u2019s black powder arms. Meanwhile Tex and Thunderhawk charged the rest of the troops, with Tex making a b-line for Napoleon. Fortunately for Napoleon his Armored Imperial Guard stood between him and Tex. They drew there swords and began their <b>Charge with the Point</b> attack. Tex used the mechanical muscle of his <b>Trusty Robo-Steed 'Rusty'</b> to leap over the Imperial Guard and then with his generated spin he fired his revolvers over his shoulders and knocked the Guards off their horses like tin cans of a fence rail.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Napoleon\u2019s artillery was firing on the rest of the PCs with the help of it\u2019s aspect <b>Whiff of Grapeshot</b>. Bengal decided to jump his car over the battlefield Hazzard-style to take out the cannons. Bunker called upon his <b>Hidden Resource Caches</b> to place a <b>Box of Grenades</b> in the back of the Interceptor. As the car launches into the air Gorlla grabs on and goes sailing behind them. His weight along with Bengal\u2019s driving ability helps the turn the car over and dump out the now <b>Duct Taped Clusters of Grenades</b> onto the Cannons.<br/><br/>Tex having taken out the Imperial Guard sets his sites on Napoleon Unhorsing him with a shot to the shoulder. Then calling him out in front of his troops he set up a duel with Napoleon himself. But the ever treacherous villain tried to shoot Tex with his <b>High Tech Laser Dueling Pistol</b> before the turn and fire command had been given. Tex shot the gun out of his hand and then told him to pick it up and finish the duel. <br/><br/>Kallista and the Fire Witch trade magic back and forth with the Fire Witch getting pounded first thrown into the mud and then knocked stupid by the debris from a destroyed cannon until she was finally defeated. Her attacks were pretty ineffective as well even accidentally burning off Napoleon\u2019s big bicorn hat just in time for his defeat at the hands of Tex. The grateful townsfolk came out to hail the triumphant heroes and told them that they had the eternal gratitude of <b>Water Lou</b>.<br/><br/>The session ended there largely because I hadn\u2019t planned much more to do in the situation creation, I also messed up the timing of the event and thought it ended an hour before it was supposed to. Overall things went well and I learned some valuable lessons for how to run the game. The main one was letting the players create the situation of the game, and really let them build upon the scenario before I get things rolling. I also had several SotC veterans at this game and they really helped my understanding of the system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147762">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Denys" title="Denys"><img alt="Denys" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j128/iannoble/elf-pic.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Denys">Denys</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147762/#Comment_147762" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T16:40:34+00:00" title="June  3, 2008  4:40PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Steerpike</cite><br/><br/>That rocks!

Gorlla faced off against the lizardman centurion in an arena style battle, while the others were making short work of his troops. Bunker eventually got over the trill of flight and dropped some Molotov cocktails on the centurion, but again in his excitement he forgot to light them. But this was fine as Gorlla was more than able to give the spark necessary to torch the centurion using his <b>Extraordinary Electro-Mace</b>.<br/><br/>After the battle the PC\u2019s were approached by Orville the Captain of the Wing Guard, he explained how the Vegan\u2019s had stolen the settlement\u2019s <b>Power Converter</b> and how they desperately needed it back. So once again it was time for a quick planning session. What was the Shattered Earth Vegas like? And how would they get the <b>Power Converter</b> back?<br/><br/>The players quickly got into the planning as they throw down a <b>Zeppelin</b> for a nighttime air assault. (Honestly what is a SotC game without Zeppelins?) Where was the Power Converter being held? Well in the basement of the Luxor being used to power the huge light on top to signal the Lizardmen\u2019s homeworld on Vega. (Now were the lizardmen aliens, or just confused mutants? Who knows, and more importantly for this setting who cares?) As for the Vegas culture the strip Hotels were essentially <b><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">City</span>/Hotel States</b> each with their own culture based on the hotel theme, and constantly at war with each other looking for the advantage. And currently Nero from Caesar\u2019s Palace was the <b>Emperor of the Strip</b>. There was also an underground rebellion amongst the Vegas Lounge Lizards called the <b>Temperance Unit</b>. How would they get the Power Converter out of Vegas well surely they could steal one of the cars from the <b>Ancient Auto Museum</b>. This was all pretty much 100% Pure Inflammable Awesome!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_148865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mcellis" title="mcellis"><img alt="mcellis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mcellis">mcellis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148865/#Comment_148865" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-08T14:23:42+00:00" title="June  8, 2008  2:23PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So the PCs start their hang-gliding night assault on the Luxor from the <b>Hooville Zeppelin</b>. (One of the players came up with the name <b>Hooville</b> for the Hoover Dam settlement) And things immediately start to go wrong. Firstly we had two failed hang-gliding attempts, Bunker failed his roll and went spiraling off down the strip, while Tex compelled his <b>Amusement Park Android</b> to collapse the wings of his glider and crash through the side of the Pyramid. The rest of them managed to land and sneak into the Luxor.<br/><br/>They found Tex crashed halfway through one of the interior balconies with his feet dangling over the heads of a crowd of Vegan Lounge Lizardmen gambling and taking in a floor show of cage dancing <b>White Slave Tigresses</b>. They pull Tex out and he immediately starts to run after Bunker. (His player had taken the roll of Bunker\u2019s <b>Guardian</b> in one of his Team Up issues.) Bengal seeing his fellow felines caged leapt into action along with Thunderhawk to rescue the Tigresses and stomp some lounge lizards. Gorlla and Kallista took this as enough of a distraction to sneak into the glass elevator and head down to the Power Converter in the basement.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Bunker had crash landed his hang-glider right in the middle of the motorcycle chariot race around the fountain at Caesar\u2019s Palace. He uses his stunts and aspects to charm the Lizardmen and he is brought before Nero where he quickly tries to convince him that the Pharaoh of the Luxor is plotting a take over, he tags the <b>Zeppelin</b> as it gets illuminated by the Luxor\u2019s spotlight only to have it go out as the Power Converter is wrenched free. Nero is convinced and sets his legions at the ready and tells his guards to take his new favorite slave to the pens.<br/><br/>Back at the Luxor, Gorlla and Kallista have taken the Power Converter out of the basement while Bengal uses a mighty <b>Roar!</b> to intimidate the lounge lizards as he charges them. Thunderhawk frees the <b>White Slave Tigresses</b> with a swipe of his <b>Fantastic Fireblade</b>, and Bengal tears into the Lizardmen with <b>Savage Beastman</b> fury leading his fellow felines in the fight against their oppressors. Tex is marching down the strip the theme park atmosphere of Vegas is setting his programming into overload. Leading him to suddenly confront the whole of Caesar\u2019s legion in a Vegas Strip showdown.<br/><br/>Bunker using his <b>Slippery Little Devil</b> easily escapes his guards and heads back to Nero\u2019s podium. He gets on the loudspeaker and starts to talk of rebellion against Nero. The lizard legions laugh off Tex\u2019s challenge asking \u201cYou and what army?\u201d With that the <b>Temperance Unit</b> was activated as a bunch of lounge lizards on the strip threw off their sequined jackets revealing their somber puritanical garb and guns. \u201cWith that one.\u201d He then drew his guns and started to mow down legionaries. <br/><br/>Having got the Power Converter the PCs back at the Luxor decide to activate that <b>Ancient Auto Museum</b> to get the Converter back to Hooville, they pick up <b>Elvis\u2019s Pink Cadillac</b>, a minivan (Gorlla and Kallista were getting very domestic), and a <b>Sherman Tank</b>. Bunker meanwhile continues to ferment rebellion claiming Nero as a false emperor and that <b>Vegas Needs a New King!</b> And who should literally crash the party (Thanks to the Tank making a hole) at just the right moment? Bengal <b>The King of the Black Top Jungle</b> driving the <b>King\u2019s Caddy</b>! Needless to say the Crowd goes wild and after that it\u2019s all just clean up and TCB Baby!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
