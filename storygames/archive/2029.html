<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judson Lester</cite>As to an RPG for yer gramma?</blockquote>
I didn't want to derail another productive thread, but I want to share anecdotes about playing games with tolerant/curious/drunk relatives.  <br/><br/>1.  When I was, like, ten I wrote a tabletop version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunt_the_Wumpus" rel="nofollow">Hunt the Wumpus</a> and made my Grandparents play it with me.  They were a little confused but they rolled with it like grognards.<br/><br/>2.  First edition Traveller with my Mom.  She and I were merchant scout types on a ship, and my brother was the GM.  We were boarded by pirates, captured, tied to chairs, taunted, and murdered via airlock.  Good times.  Given her interest in playing to "find out what we were up to", I'm surprised she was so supportive after that.  <br/><br/>3.  The Morrow Project with my Dad, also GMed by my older brother.  My Dad's sort of a right-wing survivalist type so he got into it, insisting on playing a character who had natural night vision.  That was strictly <i>not in the rules</i> but he was our Dad, what could we do?  There was a lot of shooting things and some blowing up of things for added spice.  <br/><br/>How about you?                </div>

Holy crap. You and your mom. Is it wrong that I'm giggling?<br/><br/>I tried once to play D&amp;D with my parents. Might actually have been my first time playing. I was 11, I think, and I didn't know what to do, and was trying to be the DM, and it was horribly boring. My dad fell asleep.                        </div>

                            I think maybe my brother was working through some family issues there, being a fourteen year old in a suddenly-inverted power dynamic with his Mom and irritating younger brother ... or maybe we just rolled badly.                        </div>

                            I have two experiences doing role-playing stuff with parents.<br/><br/>My first RPG ever was the old red Basic D&amp;D box set. Pam, a friend of the family, thought I (11) and my brother (8) would be interested and brought it over. My dad and Pam and her husband tried to read the rules as we went and make up characters on the spot, as if it were some board game that you could do that (and why can't you, dammit?). An hour or two later, we agreed to get back together at some later date and try to actually, you know, play. In the weeks before we played, I read the rules a bunch of times but didn't really get it. We finally reconvened. My dad was the DM. He had not read any of the rules and expected me to tell him and everyone else how to play. I didn't understand stuff well enough to DM a game. We fumbled for about fifteen minutes and it disintegrated. I eventually figured enough out to run stuff for my brother and a friend of mine and the rest is history.<br/><br/>Last year, my wife and I hosted a 'How To Host a Murder Mystery' party. We sent invitations to her parents, her sister Jen, Jen's husband Chris, Chris' sister and her boyfriend. We did the full dinner party thing with Twenties music to suit the story. It was a blast and my in-laws got into it by dressing appropriately (dad as a ship captain and mom as a 1920-era European heiress). They talked in funny voices without anyone suggesting it and in general hammed it up more than Jen and Chris, veteran role-players, did.                        </div>

                            For years and years i played Heroquest (not the RPG) the old Milton bradly board game. My friends and i played in these long campaigns with plot and character roleplaying and all that (we didn't play a lot of D&amp;D for some reason, i don't know why). One time it was me and my freind's grandmother playing against my friend.<br/><br/>This woman was such a grandma. Plastic covers on the couch. Hot dogs for dinner. WHole milk everyday after school. NO INTEREST in fantasy or sci-fi or anything that wasn't precious moments or lifetime tv related.<br/><br/>She named her character Sue. My friend had a shit-fit yelling about how that didn't fit the feeling of the game, how it didn't match up with a fantasy-type language, and that she wasn't trying. (we were 11)<br/><br/>So she imediatly changed her name to Highpockets McCrory. To this day i have no idea where she pulled that name from. Perhaps she rode the rails when she was young. The name was deamed acceptable and we played the rest of the afternoon. Many orcs were slain.                        </div>

                            Highpockets McCrory - That rocks!<br/><br/>I've played Once Upon a Time with my whole family a couple of times, but for full out RPG's there was just one crazy experience playing Pagan Shore with my Mom. Brand wrote about it over on <a href="http://games.spaceanddeath.com/yudhishthirasdice/19" rel="nofollow">Yud's Dice </a>at the time (I also have a post at SA, but I've since made it unviewable. If anybody wants to see it, let me know, and I'll mail it).<br/><br/>In short: My mom did some wicked things because she hadn't been trained to let the game constrain her, and treated the game like a textual fiction. Brand picked a subject matter that was kind of a dangerous area of play, and as we talked about it, old family baggage screwed up the very formation of the social contract to the point where I couldn't explicitly identify to him that the subject matter wasn't a good place to play. Things went well for a while despite it, and later, my mom and I butted heads over something unrelated, Brand tried to impose system to fix the problem, and the legs went out from all of us for a while. But we ended up on OK ground in the end.                        </div>

I cast an Interrupt:<br/><br/>===<br/>When I was... uh... pre 10, I programmed Hunt the Wumpus on one of these:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.vintage-computer.com/images/atari800.jpg"/><br/><br/>OMG, Nostalgia Strike!<br/>===<br/><br/>Now back to the thread. EDIT, and oh shit I had something to contribute, too!<br/><br/>When I was again around 8 or 9 or so, my dad and I saw a commercial for Star Frontiers on the TV. Didn't know what it was, but it looked fun. So we were at a bookstore about 3-4 weeks later and they had it, so we bought it. It was like, what, $15.00? <br/><br/>Anyway, we too tried to 'figure it out', but weren't too successful. Man, those old games were great as long as you had someone there to tell you what the hell you were supposed to DO with it. We played it like a kind of board game for a while, moving our pieces around the fold-out map, shooting guys, playing poker (my dad made up houserules for poker on the fly). We tried it a few times but it kinda fizzled. I still kept the books, and read them often... Cut to about 1, maybe even 2 years later: After church, I was reading the books in the car again (I usually just read the world/race/tech stuff)... and suddenly I *got it*. I figured out that you were supposed to engage in the adventures and 'do stuff', not just wander around the provided play board like it was an Open Monopoly or something.<br/><br/>We never played after that, although my dad's been interested and I've been meaning to run something for him sometime. Maybe I'll throw down The Shadow of Yesterday for my dad and stepmom this Christmas...<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            My version was so better than yours.  I extrapolated, based on my limited but mind-blowing D&amp;D experience, to include an equipment purchasing pre-expedition phase, during which you could buy suction cups (to protect against bottomless pits) and bat repellant (to repel bats), as well as arrows.  Plus you played with grandparents.                        </div>

If you play Dogs like Jason plays dogs, I'd bring a change of pants in case they throw you out in the slow on your ass. ;-)                        </div>

                            I was introduced to roleplaying in 5th grade, when I transferred to the school where Dad taught.  (I accept pity <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> .)  At lunch, he and a fellow teacher started up an incredibly fun random dungeon crawl for 8 or so interested students.  I was hooked, and read the book while waiting on him at the end of the school day...                        </div>

                            In BC, at least, there is a school course called Navigator. The basic pitch is: you pick a field of interest, create a learning proposal, learn about and explore that field of interest, and host a presentation at the end of the semester.<br/><br/>People used Navigator to study random subjects of interest (ex. Mayan civilization, woodworking, genocide), improve skills in a certain sport/activity (ex. hockey, golf, biking), or learn new activities (ex. knitting, drumming.)<br/><br/>First semester of my Grade 12 year, I did RPG Design. It was in this semester that I first learned about newfangled indie games, and joined The Forge. I created a post-apoc, war-torn, near-future game called Point of Collapse. (available at my site, www.incitefulentertainment.com, for those interested.)<br/><br/>For my end of term presentation, I presented on how designing the game went, and ran a short session. I had pre-gens. The scenario was a simple one: You all work for Coca-Cola's Armed Forces (Corporate armies, w00t!), and you are delivering cargo to a bottling plant. Your subway train picks up a signal from another train, which has crashed and left many injured and dead. What do you do?<br/><br/>So, I played this with my mom, my teacher (also the school counsellor), and three friends I'd invited to play (two had gamed before). The game used pre-gens like the doctor addicted to painkillers, the army sergeant who needs money bad, and the driver who's bitter about being a widow. The session was a SMASHING success, and completely validated what I do to both my mother and school, while at the same time earning me school credit.                        </div>

                            I distinctly remembering learning plenty from my college girlfriend's parents when I ran Call of Cthulhu for them.  Total derail of adventure, as their PI and mobster went to absolute town, plus one of them killed the other about one hour thirty into the session.   I distinctly remember thinking "hey, wait... actually, never mind: this is much better than anything I'd replace it with."                        </div>

                            I think my dad help us figure out Red Box D&amp;D, because I don't remember any other way that we figured that out. I mean, WTF, how are you suppose to figure out what a Saving Throw is without having someone show you. Maybe that's why I never played D&amp;D the right way. My dad bought me James Bond, Star Frontiers, Conan, and a bunch of other games when I was young. I still have all the games that he bought me.<br/><br/>I played InSpectres with my mom, the SO, and one of my nieces. My mom made up something so scary that my niece said, Grandma that's scary. Stress dice. My mom really liked it and got into the game pretty easily. I've recruited her for a game on Christmas day of something.<br/><br/>I've had several games of Once Upon a Time with my family at Christmas. It's been a long time since we did that, but it was a big hit. I'd like to bring that to Christmas again sometime, but this year it's going to 1001 cards or whatever that game is called.                        </div>

                            I tried to play Star Frontiers with my parents during a car trip in 1982 or 83.  It didn't seem right that my dad wasn't making his own dice rolls, but I went with it, because he was driving and all.  We were playing the adventure that came with the box set where they had crashed on Volturnus and somehow we got to the part with the lava--which really doesn't make any sense since that's about two-thirds of the way into the adventure and there's no way we played that long--and then someone fell into the lava and died and we stopped for some reason.  <br/><br/>I imagine it was because my dad was tired of it.  He never saw the point in games.  But, now he plays them with my son and is actually pretty amusing.  He shouts "KILL! KILL! KILL!" when he rolls the dice when we play STAR WARS RISK, which I think is hilarious.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>
