                    This is what it sounds like!<br/>
<br/>
<b>Card Mechanics:</b>  Deal seven-card hands to each player.  Try to go out by playing sets and runs, or by playing cards onto other players' sets and runs.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Transparently layered story mechanics:</b>  When you play a run of suited cards, you must describe an event--in three or fewer sentences--in the story of that suit's protagonists.  When you play a set of differently-suited cards, you must describe a way in which the stories of those three (or four) suits interact.  When you play a single card onto somebody else's set or run, just add one sentence to the story of the played card's suit.<br/>
<br/>
At the beginning of your turn, draw a card either from the deck or from the discard pile.  If you pick up only the top card from the discard pile, you don't have to do anything extra.  If you pick up multiple cards, you must play the bottom-most card you picked up immediately, and in doing so you must describe an event that takes place in the history of the related suit's story (sentence limitations as above).<br/>
<br/>
If you go out, any cards you play on that turn must describe endings.<br/>
<br/>
If you discard a card that could be legally played on the table, any other player may say "THAT'S not how it happened," pick up the card, play it and retcon an already-played event in the related suit's story.  The retconning player then discards, and play continues to his or her left.  If the card that got retconned was your attempt to go out, you must draw three more cards.  If you end your turn with an empty hand--by playing out so that you can't discard--everyone else gets one more turn to wrap things up before the game ends.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Restrictions:</b>  You can't play a set containing a given suit until someone has played a run of that suit.  The first time you play a run of a given suit, name the two main characters in that story and write them down on a piece of paper in the middle of the table.<br/>
<br/>
The first story about Hearts must involve Love; just so Diamonds and Money, Clubs and Pain, and Spades and Bad Luck.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Goals of this Microgame:</b>  To practice remembering recent events in play for any game that involves multiple plotlines (Polaris, Web of Shadows, etc).  Also, to learn how to do endings.                </div>
