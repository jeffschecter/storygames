That "Right now, right as we're sitting down to play this game" stuff is gold, Ben.<br/>\n<br/>\nI laid out the character sheets for the pilots in the Final Act scenario, and described who they were.  Then I asked who they wanted to play.<br/>\n<br/>\nSilence.<br/>\n<br/>\n"Who do you like?" I asked.<br/>\n<br/>\n"... I don't like any of them," said Gino. "I hate them all. They're all dicks."<br/>\n<br/>\nWhoa. Turns out that likeable characters are pretty damn important to our group. Right then and there, I had to make sure Gino was fine was continuing to play. We agreed that we'd go for half an hour and see how he felt. Don't worry - the game turned out pretty well from here, and we agreed we're interested in playing more Bliss Stage. We'll just set up our own characters, make sure we like them, and then let the war take its toll on them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, man, that freaked me out.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, assigning characters went quite slowly.  Once it was all done, I started the Briefing Action, and immediately got into the character of Jim Preston.  I assigned Gino as first pilot - that had been my intention all along because I felt he would really get the game, and set a good tone.  Now, I felt it was important to see if he was going to be engaged by the mechanics.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe process for the first mission actually worked pretty well.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause none of the players had had a chance to read the book, there was a lot of me explaining how an action worked, lots of the players getting oriented on how much they could describe and in what voice, and hesistancy in assembling and describing their ANIMas. I would say it took maybe 10 minutes to lay all the ground work for starting the Mission Action for real.<br/>\n<br/>\nThroughout the game, I observed (and we talked about later) a tension between anchor and pilot about how much the anchor could describe of what was going on in the dream world.  To begin with, they laid things out and lots and lots of detail, but as the mission went on the anchor got cut out of the process - reduced to asking questions, dominated by the pilot, or shut out by the GM and other players when the nightmare took control.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo start with, Gino's pilot and Svend's anchor engaged in simple description and looking around the dreamworld (as well as some nice in-character stuff). But building to crisis points was effortless, as Svend indicated that he was picking up an odd signal and asked Gino whether he was seen anything strange. From there we had a horde of demons bursting out of the sky - and it was obvious that they were decoys, trying to distract the pilot from the real alien threat to the resistance cell's base<br/>\n<br/>\nAllocating dice took a little getting used to, but understanding the consequences of where you'd put the dice came quickly after reading the first set of results. Gino rolled crap, didn't achieve the first mission goal (Prevent the enemy from reaching the base), the nightmares took control of the dream, and several relationships to damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would say that Gino was fully engaged by the time he was having to make the decisions about where to allocate his dice.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Just as an aside: the rules don't seem to clearly spell out the default number of dice that are allocated to each category. It's in there but I had to read pages 96-97 five times to understand that you put ONE dice on each card, unless you're threatening them, etc.</i><br/>\n<br/>\nIn the second Mission Action, Gino's pilot got into an argument with Svend's anchor about their unborn child, and the anchor forcibly ejected him ("I want my kid to grow up with a father") just after Gino'd completed Goal 1 of the mission.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen Svend became the new pilot to finish off the mission, and Wayne stepped up as anchor. Svend choose Gino's pilot as a relationship. When their relationship got damaged, it pushed Gino over the edge and he blissed out. This was, like, the third action of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think we're all shocked that someone bottomed out so quickly, and that Gino (who had been pulled out of the dreamworld, and didn't seem to be an immediate danger) would be basically killed by what had happened with Svend.  This raised some questions about how things worked in the Bliss Stage world, but we brushed of them because they were tangential to where the emotion is in the story were going.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I think it was a great lesson about being careful than choosing the relationships you form your ANIMa out of - and that those decisions would become really interesting in long-term play.<br/>\n<br/>\nGino read through the list of options for Blissing Out, and chose to fall asleep with a smile on his face.  Then in his Resolution Action, he narrated his pilot floating to his feet, possessed by the aliens, and giving a speech about how they could never be defeated.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to be clear on this, so I asked him, "Are you resolving the hope by saying the aliens can't be defeated?"<br/>\n<br/>\n"Yep."<br/>\n<br/>\nWhoa. That hit me hard, and I think the others too. It was a great illustration of the power of the Hopes.<br/>\n<br/>\nFollowing that, Svend set up an Interlude Action using his privilege.  He wanted to relieve some stress on his relationship with another pilot, but ended up having an argument with his brother that we Judged had defined their relationship and therefore built trust.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst off, it was cool how the Interlude Action went in a different direction from what we all expected. Second, it was intense. Coming off the death of Gino's pilot, centring on a jealous brother warning a pilot away from his sister. It was great, gripping, teen-angsty role playing from Celeste, Gino, and Svend.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe'd been playing for about an hour and we ended things there, rather than go onto the next, longer mission and leave it unresolved. I felt we had encapsulated the Bliss Stage experience. Afterwards, we had a really good conversation about what had and hadn't worked, congratulated each other on really awesome moments, and agreed that it would be good to play again - with our own (likable!) characters.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
