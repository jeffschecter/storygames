                    Hey, everyone. I just wanted to say that I've just started up a roleplaying blog: critical-miss.blogspot.com<br/>
<br/>
Its aim is humble, but to me tremendously important: to try to communicate Theory to non-theorists, (namely, the people I game with) in plain language and a minimum of jargon. Its main influences are probably Vincent Baker (specifically "Hardcore"), Chris Chinn, and Ben Lehman. The real test will be whether I end up saying anything original that couldn't have better served by simply pointing folks to those guys or others.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if anyone's interested, check it out, feel free to comment, and let me know if you feel I'm on track in my goal of bringing fire to the people. that means both critiquing the ideas and the way they're presented, all with the intended audience in mind. Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

                            Joel, it's interesting stuff: especially as you've paraphrased a lot of the theory. Always interesting to see someone trying to explain stuff in their own words. We could have a long discussion about whether it's accurate to describe Gamism as "Kicking Ass".<br/><br/>Have you seen Troy Costisick's interestingly misnamed blog <a href="http://socratesrpg.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">Socratic Design</a>? I think his aims are similar to yours.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            Hmm, haven't read Troy's. They's a looootta gaming blogs out there.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading mine, I definitely appreciate it. I understand what you mean about the "kicking ass" moniker; in factI'd go so far to say that "mean something" and perhaps even "make it real" are similarly inadequate. I was partly constrained by trying to avoid simply cribbing either Vincent's (Say Something, Prove Themselves, Be There) or Ron's (Story Now, Step on Up, Right to Dream) catchphrases. Also, I think there's a value in being able to kind of triangulate between the three sets and arrive at an impression of the full meaning. For instance, "prove themselves" is misconstruable; one could be trying to "prove oneself" by addressing a narrativist premise. in any case, my follow-up essay, which looks closer at the three agendas, will hopefully zero in more on what they are and do.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the real trick will be getting my game group buds to read and hopefully respond (or even if they don't respond, we can hopefully have something to chat about on our game night downtime). I've emailed everyone that I can the link. Hope this project bears some fruit. Though writing in itself always heps me to understand my own thought processes, so hey, there's that.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for reading!<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
