<div class="Message">
                    So, over in the Threads to watch thread, the discussion came up regarding designs that fit with the lifestyle of a mid-range age group of gamers. I'm 35, been playing pgs since around 1980 or so and fit in that bracket. the discussion was spurred by an rpgnet post about a player who was leaving the hobby for a variety of reasons.<br/><br/>I think that gaming in that 25-35 age bracket is hard. I don't think that many games are designed with that age bracket in mind, although there is certainly a body of articles that have been written about the issue.<br/><br/>Anyway, here are some of my thoughts on issues to consider about this age group. I'll leave it to your Gamist wiles to figure out approaches that deal with these.<br/><br/>1) This age bracket has out of gaming responsibilities.<br/>In terms of money, career, and time, this age group is likely to have other considerations that take precedence over gaming, no matter how much they love it. Further, this age bracket is likely to have peers working under similar constraints.<br/><br/>2) Going along with <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, this age bracket is likely to be interacting with non-gamers even more regularly than gamers.<br/>Hrm? Okay, what I mean is this: For me, at a younger age, I could find gamers all around me. Once I hit this age bracket, the situations that allowed me to connect with other gamers my own age were lessened. No college/school. Thus, I'm looking at gaming, but now I'm looking at potential players that have little/no rpg experience, and are themselves working under the constarints of situation <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>.<br/><br/>3) I have disposable income, better than I had at an earlier age, but I need to be more selective with it.<br/>This came up in the Spirit of the Century thread ( by Vaxalon, I believe). Price _is_ important. I can spend $50 on a game, or I can spend $50 on a movie or beer. I _know_ I'm going to drink the beer or see the movie. I'm not as surre about the game, no matter what I'd like to have happen.<br/><br/>4)If I can get 4 people together for 4 hours, 2 of them are going to be kibbitzing. It also might only happen once a month.<br/>If we end up playing a game, something had better happen. 4 hours of chargen? I think not. 4 hours of a single combat? It'd better be an epic battle, not two rooms and a couple weedy goblins.<br/><br/>5) Replay value.<br/>Boardgames have replay value. RPGs promise it. I can pick up Monopoly and play it any old time. I can play it with a different group composition. This does not tend to be true with rpgs.<br/><br/>6) I need to not have to spend a bunch of pre-game time that may not come into play.<br/><br/>7) Conversely, there is an important solo-hobby aspect that keeps me interested. <br/>Both minis games and ccgs have aspects of non-active play that form part of the hobby aspect. How can this be encouraged in a system for an rpg?<br/><br/>Okay, that's what I've got. Feel frre to add or grill me as appropriate.<br/><br/>Best regards,<br/>Robert                </div>

                            Yeeees. Life was much easier before 25 ;-)<br/>I have sometimes commented similar things with my friends.<br/><br/>But why does the bracket end at 35? I think everything you say is applicable to people over 35.                        </div>

                            Why top out at 35?  I would have thought 25-45 or even 25-55 is what we are discussing, once you have a job, long term relationship, maybe kids, then a lot of the issues that I think you correctly identify become relevant.<br/><br/>You may or may not already know this, but Savage Worlds was created explicitly for this demographic, as the author and his friends fell within it.  I can't find the article anymore, but Shane Hensley (the author) wrote a very interesting piece on the philosophy behind the game which was entirely driven by the needs of this demographic.<br/><br/>I'm not saying by the way go play SW, simply that it is relevant because it is an explicit attempt to address this issue.<br/><br/>Looking at your list:<br/><br/>1.  Definitely, I have significant work responsibilities and far more committments generally, time is a real problem for me.  My friends have similar issues, and some have kids which brings its own responsibilities and pressures.<br/><br/>2.  Definitly again, though I live in London which makes this fairly moot for me as the pool here is so large.<br/><br/>3.  I have disposable income coming out of the yazoo, but little time.  I think there is a split here, some folk like me have all the money they need for gaming, it's just not a meaningful expense to me now that I have a decent job and so on.  Other people however have kids and other major expenses and find it hard to justify leisure spending.  I think both groups are time starved, which is the key point, it's just one is time starved with other big draws on their income and one is time starved but with fewer draws on their income.<br/><br/>4.  I play every week, but I think for many this is a real issue.  A game should be capable of satisfying play in an evening, much as a boardgame or card game would be.<br/><br/>5.  Personally I think rpgs have tremendous replay value, but I think this can be improved.  I'll return to that shortly.<br/><br/>6.  Absolutely, prep time is something I routinely just do not have.  Prep time spent on something that doesn't see play is not ok, if I use that time it has to have real value because something else is not getting done while I'm prepping.<br/><br/>7.  This doesn't really resonate with me.  I want to spend my gaming time gaming, I have a huge number of other things to do when not gaming and do not really want a solo play aspect.<br/><br/>So, what could help?<br/><br/>Rules need not be light, but they need be intuitive and easily houseruled.  If I have only a day a month to play in I do not want play stopped while I look up rules, but nor do I want something too rules light particularly if I am playing with people more accustomed to board and card games where the rules are reasonably clear.  Thus I want flexible and intuitive rules that are easily amended/kludged without breaking the game.<br/><br/>Anything that gets me playing faster is good.  I want rapid chargen, I want pregens, I want prestatted opponents that I can simply plug and play.  Pendragon has stats for a variety of standard NPCs, that is part of why I am currently running Pendragon, of course there are other ways of getting the same end but I do not want to spend an afternoon that I do not have prepping NPCs.<br/><br/>Chargen cannot be a session to itself.  Lots of games now assume we have a session creating characters, I then go away and prep a game based on those characters, then we play.  Quite simply, that takes too long.  I want pregens or better yet to swiftly create the characters on the night and be playing within half an hour.  nor do I want to spend much time deciding what the setting is or anything like that.<br/><br/>Mechanisms to encourage replay help.  That's why Savage Worlds has levels by the way, it is explicitly designed to create an incentive to keep playing, to see your guy level up.  Other things may also help, but I prefer ongoing games to one shots and so do many other gamers, thus anything which helps me run an ongoing game is good.  By contrast, if a game is for one-shots then I want it to be playable out of the box.  Both techniques have their place, and produce different results.  For ongoing games, I want fast chargen, mechanics to reward continued play, quick bursts of gaming goodness - I do not want to play for a month before I get to the good stuff whatever that happens to be.  For one off games I want to open the box and play, so pregens are good, a predefined setting is good, prestatted opponents or some way of getting to the same end, all these things help me.<br/><br/>Thoughts?                        </div>

                            The age range was completely arbitrary. I took a guess that those ten years would be particularly tough, with people's kids reaching an age where they could either participate or amuse themselves without eating glass or something after the parent was 35ish. Also, I guessed that a person's career/job tends to stabilize a bit at around the same age and people start to settle into a place rather than move for career or other reasons, making it more likely to find or recruit a gaming group. I could easily push the number to 40 or 45. If after that age you've still got young children or home disruption, you're likely one of the few in thwe gamer pool experiencing it. Again, just a guess on that one. I'm sure there are many exceptions.<br/><br/>What sorts of mechanisms encourage replay is an interesting one I'll have to think more about and specifically about how they might be different for this demographic. One thought is some method of making downtime related activities an integrated part of the game. Right now they exist ( planning, making maps, drawing characters, whatever) but there isn't much rules integration/reward ( Although there is an essay on the Universalis site regarding in-game rewards for metagame activities like that).<br/><br/>I've also had some discussion with a gaming buddy about character development in play as opposed to pre-play. That's almost downright old fashioned, but I'm wondering if, again, there's a way to mechanically encourage it.<br/><br/>On a strictly personal level, I'd like there to be mechanics that reward rotating GMship, too and make doing that easy.                        </div>

                            I think downtime activities is another place where a split in the demographic occurs (the other split being over money) - some gamers in this demographic enjoy the prep side of the hobby and will look for that, some want to spend as much time as possible in actual play (me included actually) and will view any downtime activity as a waste of their time.<br/><br/>Now, one game will not fit all, but I think one should either emphasise downtime activities for the one group or minimise them for the second, but one should not be somewhere in between as neither group will then be happy.<br/><br/>I think this is very much two different tastes.  Some adult gamers really enjoy the downtime stuff and it is a bonus for them.  Others, like me, are already struggling to find time to play in and absolutely do not want stuff taking up yet further time.                        </div>

                            Hpw about things that give bonuses but don't penalize where downtime is concerned? Or which are optional? Trying to imagine what it's like. Hmm.<br/><br/>Ah- Joe makes up a cool map. The group decides that Joe get two re-dos/re-rolls that night for his efforts. I mean, yeah, something more elegant than that, but whatever.<br/><br/>The reason I mention it is becasue I think the downtime stuff adds to the hobby connection overall.                        </div>

                            First off, I'm not sure I agree with <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> and <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>. I can only speak for myself, but I have more disposable income than I ever have. I am more than willing to spend money on a great game with great production values (and I include indie stuff like <em>Polaris</em> and BWr here; indie games get layout better than most big publishers I see).<br/><br/>Then again, I don't have kids yet. That's really the big determining factor when it comes to time and spending.<br/><br/>I think the solution is basically to make great games that clearly lay out how play is supposed to work. BE is a thick, crunchy game, but world creation, chargen, and campaign creation/management are <em>built into the mechanics</em>. <br/><br/>So much of RPG prep, IMO, is figuring out how the game is supposed to work and what the players are going to be doing. Fix that issue, as many indie games and mainstream ones like SC2.0 have, and you've made it massively easier for people to play your game.<br/><br/>I honestly think that a lot of "lite" systems get this totally wrong. M&amp;M2e is often touted to me as easier to run than HERO. But, looking at what's in the rulebook, the GM is still pretty much on their own in figuring out how to create an adventure, what an adequate challenge is, and how to evaluate PCs. This leaves aside the fact that M&amp;M2e is still a game that benefits form using a spreadsheet. The far more crunchy SC2.0 is, I think, much easier to use. All the GC has to do is follow the steps for mission design in the GC chapter and plug some NPCs into the NPC stat tables, and BOOM... a night's entertainment.<br/><br/>Even simpler games, like Buffy or SW, are just as problematic, IMO. The mechanics may be easier, but as the GM, I'm still stuck with, "How am I going to keep everyone entertained tonight?"<br/><br/>Anyway... sorry for the rant. I just think it's the approach, not the math or bookeeping, that's the issue.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>Anyway, here are some of my thoughts on issues to consider about this age group. I'll leave it to your Gamist wiles to figure out approaches that deal with these.</blockquote>
Eh. Some of these problems don't really hold up as generalizations, and I don't think there's much in design that can help with them. I think that some of it boils down to matters of taste and or dedication - choices, in other words. Sure, your time is more limited as you get older, and sure, it's not as easy to meet other gamers, and sure, there isn't as much time to prepare stuff. A lot of games already cater to these needs - see PTA for the big one, see DitV with its "get to the cool stuff right now" aesthetic, see Spirit of the Century which was specifically designed to address some of these issues.<br/><br/>For example, your <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>? I don't follow. It sounds like you're blaming the game for your lifestyle choices. I have quite a few DVDs I've bought but haven't watched yet, just as I've got a couple of RPGs recently that I haven't played yet. I could say I just haven't had the time to sit down and watch those movies, but the reality is I haven't chosen to use what time I do have in that fashion. Plain and simple. And ultimately, most other entertainments are fleeting, whereas RPGs have a potentially unlimited shelf life. So I don't think that, other than moment-to-moment economic concerns, price really enters into it as much as you're proposing.<br/><br/>Same thing with <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a> - having two hours of kibbitzing vs. two hours of playing is purely a social concern. When I get my group together (all people in the demographic in question, two with wife and kids), there's an understanding that anything not focused toward play is to be kept to a minimum. Period. And even within that, we use aggressive scene framing to make sure that the most stuff gets done that can - no dwelling on the shopping trips and whatnot, no chewing the scenery needlessly with NPCs unless everyone's really into it. Often, we only get to play for two and a half hours or so, and we get a ton done. It's just a matter of setting up expectations properly. Can you put guidelines to that effect in a rulebook? Sure, but it's already been done.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%235&amp;Mode=like">#5</a> - I can't pick up Monopoly and play it any old time. It'd be way harder for me to do that than to run a one-shot of some random RPG. Again, choice and priorities.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%236&amp;Mode=like">#6</a> - Agreed. Tons of indie games are already very low-prep.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%237&amp;Mode=like">#7</a> - If your time is limited as per your <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, how does this aspect necessarily help you? Deliberately setting aside the free time to play is often difficult enough without also spending time with painting minis, sorting cards, or whatnot.<br/><br/>Bottom line is, most of the obstacles that adult living brings to gaming can be overcome with simple dedication, communication, and focus. Don't know any gamers? Start talking about it in other social venues with the intent of recruiting friends. Don't have much time? Push for definite schedules and take a hard stance on dithering during the session. For everything else, there's already a ton out there which supports your needs.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Balbinus</cite>Chargen cannot be a session to itself.</blockquote>
Like Vaxalon, I completely disagree with you. If the chargen process is sufficiently engaging in its own right, devoting a session to it is just fine. And moreover, if you have a decent pool of people (6+) with shifting schedules, getting everyone together on one night to make characters is a huge time saver down the road - whoever's available on any given night already has a character to play, and you've already got potential session hooks beforehand if you know who's showing up, so you can dive right in when you get to the table.<br/><br/>And again, not to be too shamelessly self-promoting, but see Spirit of the Century - it has pure "on-the fly" character generation that gets you playing in 10 minutes as well as full, whole-session chargen. And on-the-fly characters can play alongside normal ones with no real difficulty.<br/><br/><br/>-Landon                        </div>

IMO, it's quite easy, especially now that I'm an adult. Leaving aside the boon of websites like FindPlay and the "Gamers seeking gamers" fora on most gaming sites, I have far more mobility than I did as a kid, as well as more control over my time.

Heh. I was a bit taken aback by Landon's comments, but then I thought, "Well, I did recommend treating the discussion as a gamist challenge!"<br/><br/>By which I mean, it is quite possible that a reader disagrees with some or all of my core assertions. However, the discussion might go further by treating them as an obstacle or puzzle in a game that needs to be worked through. Y'know, go on into the dungeon this time rather than wandering on down the road, right?<br/><br/>Vaxalon: There are absolutely things more important than gaming. That's actually an underlying issue with this whole thread. If those things weren't more important, then I'd have all the time in the world for gaming, wouldn't I?

I had always heard that the 25-35+ demographic is the bulk of gamerdom; the whole "aging fanbase" thing. That would suggest to me that this demographic is being served pretty well, and it's other demographics, particularly younger brackets, that are currently uninterested in tabletop RPGs.<br/><br/>But I guess we're talking about serving needs, not expanding the fanbase.<br/><br/>I dunno. In the grand scheme of things, I'm not sure that mainstream games, specifically D&amp;D in Biohazard's case, are really falling down on the job. D&amp;D probably has more prepared material ("modules") available than any other RPG on earth. Assuming you're not rolling your own, DM'ing isn't all that bad. <br/><br/>In the original ENWorld thread, Eric Noah posted that he went through the same thing as Biohazard a few years back, but then switched to relying on published material as much as possible, and his time commitment went way down. Granted, this sucks some of the creative fun out of DM'ing, but if what you're mostly after is play, published modules will certainly get you there.<br/><br/>Looking at Bio's orignal post, the time commitment wasn't the only issue. I think the whole reason his thread has spawned so much discussion is that unsatisfying play seems to be the bigger culprit.                        </div>

                            I've always rather wondered how using published materials saves time, doesn't it take a while to read all that stuff and understand it?  <br/><br/>Other than that, I can see it helps some, but if all I did was essentially read out stuff given to me I don't think I'd bother.

                            I'm in this demographic, and I play more now than I ever did before. Not because I don't have more responsibilities, I do have more. But because I have more responsibilities, I've also gotten more organized (no, really, I used to be less organized than I am now), and that means more games organized and played. <br/><br/>What's changed, however, is that I don't have the time nowadays to daydream a game into existence slowly. Basically I don't have the many hours that I used to have for prep. I could organize that, but I can't rationalize prioritizing it any longer. Something had to give, and that was it. <br/><br/>Max, regarding the "lightness" of the system, it's really not about light or heavy, it's about Points of Contact. Meaning how much interface with the system do you have to have in order for play to proceed forward. Your assessment is quite correct in that "freeform" games actually have amongst the highest amounts of POC, because you're constantly negotiating exactly how things get created in-game. With a strong set of rules, that's made much simpler. <br/><br/>That said, they don't have to be voluminous rules, they simply have to be designed intent on effectively driving the action forward. This is why, for instance, Dogs in the Vinyard propells play so well clearly while having a simple rule set. Note also that when you have such a system the need for houseruling and such goes down, because the game already provides exactly what it needs to go forward. So it saves time here as well. <br/><br/>I've never seen anyone houserule anything in DitV. No need. <br/><br/>Mike                        </div>

                            The principle obstacle I've found to playing a lot as I got older (I'm 38) is that my social networks have ossified, and they don't include many people who share my gaming interests. My social network is composed primarily of (a) co-workers (b) fellow parents at my son's school and (c) old friends from my community-organizing days - none of whom are particularly gaming-friendly. Over the years, my gaming network has attritioned badly - typically, people have either given up gaming in general or transitioned to purely "beer-n-pretzels", nostalgia-based play. I definitely feel a certain cultural clash gaming with folks in their 20s, and I've found a few groups closer to my own age group - but it's very difficult being the newcomer in a circle that's worn ruts into their social contract over 20 years.<br/><br/>The biggest difficulty I face is finding people to play with who are (a) open to trying something different (b) interested in the same styles &amp; genres that I am and (c) willing to accomodate those of us who can't spend much of our free time on gaming unless carefully scheduled.                        </div>

<p>Since I'm in my 40s, I share a lot of these concerns; they are what I want to fix with my own designs. Some of the concerns, the social networking side, are going to be difficult if not impossible to solve through game design, although a game that would appeal to those currently outside the hobby (easier to grasp, restrained lasersharking, less fetishy) would certainly help. Cost is fixable by keeping everything in one book and minimizing accessories (paper, pencils, dice, or standard card decks are OK, anything else is pushing it.)</p>
<p>Time is probably the biggest concern. Things like replay value, duration of chargen, learning curve, and the like are all really questions about time investment. Here are a few of my thoughts on games for the middle-aged gamer:</p>
<p>LEARNING CURVE: The rules should be condenseable to 1 or 2 pages. They should be one or two core mechanics and a few simple variations of these for specific purposes. The rules book can elaborate these mechanics, provide numerous examples and plenty of inspiration, but you should be able to play the game using a rules cheatsheet, with no need to refer to the book at all.</p>
<p>CHARGEN: This should take five minutes, tops. You should only need to make 3 to 4 decisions during chargen and be able to detail your character with just a few descriptors. Details about background, relationships, skill specialties, and the like can exist, but should emerge as a result of play instead of being required before play begins. NO PERSONALITY ATTRIBUTES, except those that are <em>central</em> to the concept behind the game, like Sanity or Rage or Love (but not all three.) Personality should emerge through play as well.</p>
<p>EQUIPMENT: Avoid price lists. Equipment choices should be treated like other choices during chargen: they are cues to the other players about what you'd like play to include. Some games hande this with rolls against a Wealth attribute to see if you could have purchased that item, but why have a roll at all, for most things?</p>

It certianly does. The question is, is it less time than you'd have to spend if you were creating adventures from scratch? Possibly, depending how you work. I tend to be terrifyingly slow and run into blocks a lot.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Balbinus</cite>Other than that, I can see it helps some, but if all I did was essentially read out stuff given to me I don't think I'd bother.</blockquote>
This is definitely another consideration. Still, lots of people have fun running published stuff. My D&amp;D group has had good times with mega-modules like <em>City of the Spider Queen</em> and <em>Age of Worms</em>.                        </div>

I think this is the point I was trying to make when I mentioned BE and SC2.0. They give very clear direction to the GM as to creating scenarios and, in BE's case, managing an entire campaign. A lot of popular RPGs, otoh, basically leave it to the reader to grok the system and then figure out what to do with it. I've probably wasted years "putting square pegs in round holes" and/or beating my head against the wall the day before a session as a result.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Balbinus</cite>Other than that though, am I right that essentially you think we should not try to consider what would appeal more to this demographic as it is our own fault we are struggling to find time to play?</blockquote>
Not entirely right, no. Mainly, I want to advocate infusing the discussion with a healthy dose of self-perspective on two levels, is all. First, I'm not sure how many of us can really speak for the "demographic", as it were - all we can really talk about are personal experiences, and what elements of design can aid us personally, with the hope that other folks like us can benefit from it in the same way. It's more honest to do it that way, I think, and eliminates the possibility of false objectivity.<br/><br/>Second, there's a limit at which game design can realistically overcome the obstacles of personal, real-life priorities and choices, or lack of priorities and choices. I don't think that's a controversial observation, and I'm not trying to be abrasive by pointing it out - if you'd rather be a father than a gamer, when you have to choose between the two, that pretty much is what it is. (Not that I personally know anyone who'd choose the latter instead.) <br/><br/>With those two points firmly in mind, I think a lot of game designs out there *already have* addressed a lot of Robert's stated issues in a direct, focused way - the approaches are out there. Primetime Adventures is relatively cheap, has a small learning curve for newbie gamers, requires minimal prep or pre-game time during the week, and has a low enough POC to get a ton done in two hours. That's most of what he wanted. <br/><br/>But! Lemme be helpful, in the way that Robert instructed:<br/><br/>1.) I don't have as much spare time these days. -- In my experience, overt flagging mechanics (Fate's aspects, TSOY's Keys, Sorcerer's Kickers, PTA's Issues, etc.) go a long, long way toward minimizing prep. They immediately give clear suggestions for session content that you can often improvise from in play. Also, having a firm core story in place is helpful, a concept that Primetime Adventures calls "franchise" - a sense of what to expect, what the patterns are that get broken and reincorporated most often during play. Like, in a Star Trek game, you know that if you show up to play with a new planet to explore and some problem threatening the natives, no one will flip. You get that mainly from pre-game discussion, which doesn't necessarily have to take place in the session. Deliberate franchising mechanics might be an awesome way to handle this.<br/><br/>2.) I can only really play with newbies. -- Minimize your points of contact with the rules and eliminate any rules that rely on dogmatic RPG conventions if they have no purpose in the action of play, like a separate, detailed combat system, shopping lists and currency, etc. Frankly, I vastly prefer playing with newbies these days - they carry very few assumptions with them into play overall, and can very quickly get into the mode of an elegant game system with minimal instruction.<br/><br/>3.) I'm selective about my cash. -- I stand by my initial comments on this point, but you can minimize this by finding one game and sticking with it if it solves most of your needs, or splitting the cost for the gamebook amongst the group and treating it as a community text. If your friends will all shell out for bowling shoes, they'll probably shell out for a gamebook. The harder, but ultimately more satisfying route, is to design the game yourself, which makes it free. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>4.) My group kibbitzes a lot. -- Have explicit rules regarding scene framing and pacing, either in your local social contract or as a mechanic in the game. PTA does this extremely well. Consider the core action of your session, what the main arenas of player investment are, and "cut the fat" from your scening to emphasize that stuff.<br/><br/>5.) Replay value. -- I'm having the hardest time with this point, because I think it really does boil down to a matter of taste among the individuals and encouragement on your end. The design factors already mentioned above tend to contribute, IMO, to the game's replay value. Check out Tim Kleinert's The Mountain Witch for a design that gets closest to the "board game" aesthetic I think you're talking about.<br/><br/>6.) I don't want wasted prep. -- See <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>.<br/><br/>7.) Out of game, solo stuff to invest in. -- I'm stretching for this one, again, because you didn't respond to my question of how this helps you in the face of time constraints. But, if you want, you can introduce a between session activity that has some mechanical value in play - obvious example of this is the old house rules where you get extra XP if you write a journal entry about the session or whatnot. Neel K.'s Lexicon can be used as a between-session activity like this, and Malcolm Sheppard's new game Codex incorporates writing game fiction into the process of play. <br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Is any of that helpful?<br/><br/><br/>-Landon                        </div>

                            There are a few things which are different about the adult demographic, but I think a lot of these are just differing preferences rather than anything specific to the demographic.  The only objective things I've seen are: (1) less free time, and (2) find other players either as newbies or online -- rather than in the concentrated school environment where you often have clubs, say.  <br/><br/>I agree that compared to a school/college environment, adults generally have less free time.  However, that doesn't imply anything in particular about what time spent in the game should be.  If you don't like long character generation, then that's going to be a minus whether you're in school or not.  Conversely, if you do like detailed character generation (GURPS or HERO, say), then it's not a drawback.  <br/><br/>It's generally a plus if a game has flexibility in preparation -- i.e. can be run with pre-prepared material, but also allows participants to write a lot of their own stuff.  On the other hand, games can also simply be designed for one or the other.  For example, the Shab-al-Hiri Roach or the Parlor Larps games have a pre-prepared scenario, and don't allow much extra prep except by over-writing what's there.  It's just writing to one niche.  Conversely, universal systems often write to people who have more solo prep time than live in-person gaming time.                        </div>

PTA is definitely one of the games that I think of as being good for those reasons as well. Not the only one, but definitely hitting some of the right notes for me personally.

I think of those as all good examples, yes.

Ooof. My bad.<br/>How out of game stuff helps wrt time constraints:<br/>I should have clarified that a bit. I find that I do have some free time, just that it is hard to co-ordinate with other players. So, for example, OOG stuff that can be domne in small snippets of time (15-20minutes) and put back down, help me with "connection". I know I phrased that badly, but does the general gist come through?

Actually, your suggestions remind me of something I'd been pondering a while back but forgot about.<br/><br/>Here are the things that inspired it:<br/>1) The metagame rewards suggestion for Universalis (people that do stuff like host the game, do write ups, draw pics, whatever get awarded extra coins next session).<br/><br/>2) The Games Workshop Campaign events that they ran where groups fought battles and this affected the campaign outcome and got written into the overall game setting.<br/><br/>3) "Warm fuzzy awards". I don't know what else to call these. Awards that players ( usually character players) can give one another-like in PTA when someone does something you really like. ( As opposed to only a GM giving awards).<br/><br/>4) A discussion of old-time California gaming, where players commonly scooted their characters between different game groups without a big hassle.<br/><br/>So, what I'm thinking:<br/><br/>Let's say you have a game witha pretty broad setting+situation, drawn in broad strokes. For discussion, Let's say the general set up of Star Wars ( the real original, aka A New Hope). Again, for purposes of discussion, the game says something to the effect that:<br/>1) It's Space Opera.<br/>2) There's a rebellion going on against a galactic empire, and the game centers on the rebels as playable characters.<br/>3) There's an eveil emperor with some mystical powers out to crush the rebels.<br/>4) He has a henchman that has some of those same mystical powers.<br/><br/>Okay, not a lot to go on, but the rules go into <i>slightly</i> more detail. The designer specifically wants players of the game to interpret and create stuff for their own groups.<br/><br/>To support the game, we have a website. It does the usual stuff, add-ons of various kinds, discussions, whatever.<br/><br/>But lets move the Metagame awards+warm fuzzy awards up to this level.<br/>Let's say I'm running a game, but in between, I post up a piece of fan-created support. I doodle a litle, so let's say a character drawing. In itself, nice, but other than the designer or whoever is running the site, not a whole lot of recognition. I'm doing it so far just because I like the game and want to share.<br/><br/>Here's the warm fuzzy part: If another player uses some fan-created bit ( pic, storyline, scenario set up, whatever) in their actual game, they can give the contributor a "warm fuzzy" award. How does the warm fuzzy work? I dunno. It would have some in-game effect ( reoll, extra currency).<br/><br/>If the user of the fan-created piece did some sort of follow up, like an AP report that used the item, the creator could give them a warm-fuzzy also. The follow up on the use could be attached to the original post.<br/><br/>There aren't any real limits on the warm-fuzzy giving, except maybe a one warm fuzzy limit per distinct use.<br/><br/>If another player, somewhere out there in the wide world used the stuff, again warm fuzzies may be given.<br/><br/>Tracking warm fuzzies might be a honor system or some kind of bank, I dunno. I'm vague on that part.<br/><br/>I would expect there would be some sort of snowball effect that develops. As more contributions and feedback are exchanged, players in different groups would contribute more and more material. The overall direction of material would sort of become a marketplace of ideas, with conections being made between physically distant groups. I'd also imagine that storyline would coalesce eventually, or possibly multiple overlapping storylines.<br/><br/>With the Star Wars example, would we get a Luke or Ben or Have Darth develop the way he did? Again, I dunno. But I do know that Marvel comics made some really interesting offshoot SW comics between ST:NH and the release of Empire that I read raptly as a kid.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's my idea. Yeah, I stole from all over the place-Thanks to everyone that inspired this madness with their brilliance.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Shreyas Sampat</cite>Personality should emerge through play as well.</blockquote><p>John, I'm curious why you consider this an essential constraint for designs intended specifically for your age group. Please elaborate?</p>
Let me point out first that I preceeded that statement with a comment about restricting personality chargen to elements that are essential to the core concept of the game. Also, all of those examples were focusing on what it takes to cut down the time investment. Even if a player has a preference or at least a tolerance for longer chargen processes, what *sells* a game to an older gamer is the ability start a game on the spur of the moment, whenever everyone present just happens to have a few hours to spare and feels in the mood for an RPG.<br/><br/>In that context, game prep should focus on the essentials. Many elements of a character, like clothing worn, behavioral quirks, and general temperment can be evolved during play. If that's the case, why do it before play? It's almost always easier to refine your character concept in the context of a typical scenario than it is in a vacuum. Quicker, too. People often have "blank page terror" or writer's block when faced with too many choices, anyways. So, move anything that can be developed during play *into* play, to minimize prep time and make it easier to be creative.<br/><br/>Old D&amp;D did this. There were no personality decisions before play at all, yet players easily developed characters with personalities. Compare that to GURPS, where all personality details have point values and are part of normal chargen. In my experience, GURPS chargen got bogged down when players tried to decide what disadvantages to take to get the skills and advantages they thought they would need.  The result tended to be weird emotional cripples that didn't feel like real people. Oh, and half the time, they had the wrong advantages for the challenges they faced, anyways. The Quirks system was another failure in GURPS. It seemed like a good idea: encourage players to differentiate their characters by offering them character points. However, most Quirks wound up sounding pretty flat and uninteresting ("Likes to wear blue") and wasted more prep time, sometime ten or fifteen minutes, than they were really worth.                        </div>

                            The title of this thread confused me at first because my initial response was, "Isn't that what we've been doing this entire time?"  I very much see RPGs slowly gentrifying, with the target market swinging from teens to post-collegiates.  Seriously: <em>Twilight?  Roach?  Dogs in the Vineyard?</em>  These are games that primarily appeal to folks past college, already sunk in the midst of a developing lifestyle.  Even Exalted has an older qualified-cynicism thing going on in its depiction of the world (contrast between "everyone is trying to do the right thing but they're blinded by their situation" with older WoD-styled "people are fucking up the world cause they're stupid and mean").<br/><br/>I don't think the 25-35 demographic has <em>less</em> time, I think they have <em>different</em> time.  People have already mentioned that the slow-boil idle thoughts development of a campaign is possible in school and difficult out of it, and I think this is a good example.  But when you get down to the numbers of it, I play <em>way the hell more</em> these days than I ever did in school.  This is because of a few things, all part of the 25-35 demographic: I'm more mobile and willing to 'commute' to a game, I have more options in terms of money and connections in getting a game space to play in (which sounds terrible -- simply, in one instance, one player's access lets us play in a boardroom after business hours; another player owns a house), I have better time and resource organizational skills that allow me to put together games, and perhaps most importantly, I have "adult" conflict-negotiation and community-building skills that allow me to find and build a playgroup in way more conscious methods than I ever would have when I was 22.  So sure, I have less time -- but I'm able to use that time way more efficiently, and in way more structured means, than when I had all the free time in the world.<br/><br/><em>Illustrative example:</em> in high school and college, we'd organize a game and order pizza.  Nowadays, we organize a game-and-dinner night.<br/><br/>Now, while I do think that a lot of modern games are trying to appeal to an older demographic, I think a lot of them are still being designed for teenagers.  Exalted, for instance, assumes the never-ending campaign as a default structure, with most of the character development happening away from the table in daydreamland.  Its rules guide combat first, resources second, travel third, and social conflicts a distant, distant fourth.  It enshrines a GM as an absolute and beneficial authority and the players as supplicants and dependents.  These are the rule structures that teens need.  Adults can handle more complex and nuanced social interaction at the table, and probably desire nuanced social interaction in the game.  They're more capable of developing character in play and in crisis.<br/><br/>I've written <em>Full Light, Full Steam</em> with the assumption of postcollegiate players.  It has decentralized authority, emphasis on characterization over questing, deals with complex themes (identity, patriotism, imperialism, economics, oppression), and has no default structure but guidelines for creating your own.  If all goes according to plan, it will give mature players what they need and not require of them what they don't have.  It's flexible and assumes that the players are capable of switching things around to fit their life, rather than assuming that they subscribe to the "gamer lifestyle" I enjoyed when I was 20.                        </div>
