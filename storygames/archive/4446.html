Those are all dice shapes!"<br/>I started thinking about how one could possibly create a game system or mechanic that used the four classic Greek elements and the shapes associated with their atoms.<br/>I haven't thought about it all that hard, yet, but I'm aware that there are few new ideas under the sun, so I wondered if anyone else had ever considered this or done any tinkering with it.<br/><br/>The one thing that does strike me is that any system which used those dice in different ways to represent different elements would probably have to one in which larger or smaller dice were not inherently "better."  Especially because they jump from an 8 sider for Air to a 20 sider for Water.  A system based around these would have to somehow allow a 4 sided die to be just as effective, in its own way, as a 20 sided die.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100434">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chris_moore" title="chris_moore"><img alt="chris_moore" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://jesus8880.com/chapters/gematria/images/greek%20letters/psi-cap.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chris_moore">chris_moore</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100434/#Comment_100434" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-02T09:51:21+00:00" title="October  2, 2007  9:51AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Could you, perhaps, use the dice in quantities, without referring to the numbers?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_100435">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100435/#Comment_100435" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-02T09:52:42+00:00" title="October  2, 2007  9:52AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure I know what you mean, Chris.

One which would allow for numerical balance but be a pain to create would be to use custom dice with something other than the standard numbers on their faces.  Alternatively, and my preference, would be to build the system so that the different elements do different things and are not directly in competition.  That article talks about the shapes reflecting the nature of the elements and the 'd4' fire being more 'mobile' than the d6 earth.<br/><br/>All d6s could be earth and are equal to one another, the same as all d20s are equal water dice.  If you did want to put the elements in competition against one another, you could use the dice to 'build' the competitive force; a fire 'spell' requires 35 fire points (on average 10d6) while the equivalent water spell requires 105 water points (on average 10d20); in this example you need 10 dice either way.<br/><br/>Other mitigating factors could be that the smaller the die, the more predictable it is.  You're more likely to get a certain value on a d6 roll than a d20, so you could go ahead and allow water to be <i>potentially</i> more powerful but the actual power you harness depends on how close your roll is to a target number; using earth you could never be more than 5 out, while with water you could be up to 19 out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100439">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100439/#Comment_100439" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-02T10:16:54+00:00" title="October  2, 2007 10:16AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not all functional dice are Platonic solids, but most of the commonly used ones are, because they are evenly balanced.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_100443">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100443/#Comment_100443" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-02T10:41:12+00:00" title="October  2, 2007 10:41AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alternatively to put them in competition you can go with the classic circular approach, water beats fire, which beats air, which beats earth, which beats water, or somesuch.<br/><br/>You could then say if one element opposes another roll the dice for each (with evens counting as successes as above) but apply a 50% bonus (or some other number) to the dominant element.<br/><br/>Or to be really extreme use that only for non opposed elements and say that the dominant element always beats the one it is dominant over, so you need to find a way not to fight that battle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100506/#Comment_100506" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-02T12:44:23+00:00" title="October  2, 2007 12:44PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 2, 2007 12:44PM by Mike_Holmes.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As Jonathan says... beware the non-platonic D10!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, yeah, even the icocsahedron has been around for a long time, even as a die.

A mechanic I've always wanted to do something with exploits the fact that d4s roll matching numbers all the time, but they're low, while d20s don't match very often, but when they do, it's potentially very powerful.<br/><br/>Rough idea:<br/><br/>Roll your pool, which is a whole mess of dice.  d4s are your "fire" power, d6s earth, and so on.  Set aside any dice that don't have a match.  Now look at your matching sets.  The type of die rolled determines the type of effect, and the number on the die determines the power of it.  If this is a magic system (which would be cool) any set with a d4 in it could be assigned to damage, d6s could be assigned to healing, d8s to something else, d20s could do some wacked out shit.  Maybe they act as an amplifier for any set they're in?  Oh! and maybe if you roll a matched set that contains opposing elements, you remove both dice from the set? That would reward players with complimentary pools.  I'm just making things up here.  What about special effects for combinations of elements? Like, a fire and eath set can damage scenery? (that's if this is still a magic system).<br/><br/>I don't know as much about Greek elements, but Japanese elements have emotions and personalities associated with them.  If that's the case for Greek elements too, you could get a neat thing where you've got to use a matched set of dice to narrate something in the game, and it has to relate to the emotions related to that set.

They clearly shouldn't just add together, though, because it's obviously much harder to roll all 4's on 5d4 than it is to roll a 20 on a 1d20...  Perhaps matches could multiply... I'd probably need to start doing some statistics to see whether this would all work or not.<br/>Something else that just jumped into my head was the way dice worked in the Cheapass game Buttonmen.

I mean, let's say you have a pool of two dice of each type, and you get to add a new one.  Which type would you choose?  The answer is non-obvious.  Choosing a d20 seems to be going for a big risk/big reward thing, while choosing a d4 would be a more reliable advantage.  If each of the dice types corresponds to certain kinds of in-game action, the the choice is further complicated.  Your best chances lie with having a lot of the same kind of die, but that limits you to one kind of action.  <br/><br/>I'm unsure of the usefulness of nailing down the specifics of the mechanic before you've decided what the game is about or what the mechanic is even for.  At the moment this feels like designing a game by comittee, which is usually a pretty poor idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101176">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101176/#Comment_101176" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-04T20:19:38+00:00" title="October  4, 2007  8:19PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            man, you story game dudes are always so hung up on what a game is "about."  sheesh!  can't a guy just really really want to design a game mechanic based on outdated greek philosophies of reality?  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>the above was a joke.  i pretty much agree with you, Simon.<br/>but the fact of the matter is, i have no actual game in mind.  like i said, i just saw that little chart on that wikipedia page and felt like it was screaming for a game, or at least a mechanic, and i wanted to talk about it.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  maybe there's a real mechanic or game in there somewhere, waiting to come out, and maybe there isn't.  but chances are, i'm not the one who's going to find it.  but if anyone else thinks they see it...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101186">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101186/#Comment_101186" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-04T21:53:13+00:00" title="October  4, 2007  9:53PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh yeah, I mean, I do the same thing all the time, fiddling around with a mechanic for ages with no real aim in mind, just because I like how the numbers work.  <br/><br/>That said, I think there's a cool game in here somewhere.

Also, I'm kind of amused by the idea of Greek philosophers locked in mortal combat.  It comes off as kind of gonzo though.

You could just say that you need 12's to succeed ... no, that 12s are wildcards and count as a match for a set? So any time your roll either produces a 12, or a set of dice that adds to 12, then you get an extra success on top of any pairs.<br/><br/>So 3D4 rolling 3 on each dice gives 3 successes, but 3D4 rolling 4 on each dice gives 4 (a bonus for a total of 12)<br/><br/>Each 12 on a D12 is another bonus in that case, regardless of the other values, but that assumes mixed pools. Maybe you can roll your D12s on every other pool as a bonus, since it complements the other elements? D20's can roll 12s too, but less often than D12s<br/><br/>To incorporate the sizes you can say that when comparing successes the magnitude of the value from the pair breaks ties. Failing that the highest single value rolled breaks ties.<br/><br/>So you roll 4D4 and a bonus D12 against my 3D20<br/><br/>You roll 1,2,2,3 and 12, I roll 10,10,9. We both get a pair, but my pair beats yours because it is a pair of 10s not 2s. On the other hand your bonus 12 gets you three successes, so you win. Even if it had rolled an 11 instead of a 12 you still win, because your 12 beats my 10, but if my third dice was a 15 then *I* win because 15 beats 11.<br/><br/>I still think that makes D4s better than D20s, but if there is some extra use put to the magnitude later then it could work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101668">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101668/#Comment_101668" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-08T11:08:39+00:00" title="October  8, 2007 11:08AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe you can take advantage of the patterns of opposition among the elements, so that some pairs of dice (those representing fire and water, e.g.) diminish each other and others don't. Then the quintessential d12 may actually <i>augment</i> other dice types. This augmentation could be tied to the zodiac, so that 1-3 on the d12 represent fire signs and augment fire dice (d4), 4-6 represent earth signs and augment earth dice (d6), and so forth.<br/><br/>It would be neat in any case to tie the dice to the humours so that to refresh your dice of a certain type, you have to play out the emotion with which it is associated. Imagine that the scheme was such that when you rolled, you lost all dice that came up "1" (which means that fire gets used up quicker than other types, which makes intuitive sense).

This is especially true for d20s, because they have so many results that can't match the other dice.  This leads me to feel that the dice balance themselves fairly well without any additional restrictions.  I'm not sure what effect rolling more than three dice has though.  Whether that rewards the frequently matching d4s more than the higher rolling d20s is an important point, but it's beyond my math ability.<br/><br/>I think what we really need are ways to reward dice combinations, so that rolling matching numbers on different types of dice is more powerful than rolling matches on identical dice.
