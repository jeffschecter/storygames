After some consideration, I know why this is on a metagame level - everybody wants to either throw awesome magical energy around, or be lithe and fast and sneaky... even if half of them don't <i>actually</i> act anything like that in play.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnywho, this got me thinking about the possibility of a game specifically designed for playing sneaky burglars and mystical wizards. Probably with a distinct line drawn between the two. Sadly, while I love the general idea, I can't think of any games that spring out at me as being perfect for such, and really wouldn't know where to start making my own, as the general idea is so vague.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnybody got two cents (or more) to add?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262636">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262636/#Comment_262636" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-17T23:11:20+00:00" title="March 17, 2010 11:11PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There was an issue of Dragon Magazine that had some kits for Rogues and Wizards which were archaeology related.
