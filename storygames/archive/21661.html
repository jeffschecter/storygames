They\u2019d be vulnerable to theft and would want to get this to an auction house as soon as possible. After selling over their valuables, they\u2019d be given a letter of credit of some sort.<br/><br/>Perhaps letters of credit/traveler\u2019s cheques/circular notes is a way to go. But I\u2019m also not very familiar with how it works and implementing it into the setting.<br/><br/><b>Letter of Credit</b>:<br/><br/><i>Circular letters of credit were usually issued by a bank, which enabled that person  (usually an individual of means) to draw funds from correspondent banks while traveling. This was considered safer than carrying large sums of cash or coins. Such letters were often issued on special paper with formal lettering and designs to discourage counterfeiting. A letter of credit consisted of three separate items. The first item states the amount of funds that can be drawn (recorded on the back of the letter was the drawing of funds and the current balance. The second item was a list of correspondent banks. And the third was a signature card which was presented for comparison when drawing funds (it also contained additional information such as a description of the letter bearer intended to add a level of security). Travelers were advised to keep the letter and signature card separate from one another as a precaution against theft. Banks typically charged around 1% of the value of the letter for its issuance. Circular letters of credit were in many ways similar to circular notes which were in turn a precursor to later traveler's cheques.</i><br/><br/><b>Circular Note</b>:<br/><br/> <i>A circular note is a document request by a bank to its foreign correspondents to pay a specified sum of money a person. The individual\u2019s circular note is issued with a signature card letter and must be produced on presentation of the note. Circular notes are generally issued against a payment of cash to the amount of the notes, but the notes need not necessarily be cashed, but may be returned to the banker in exchange for the amount for which they were originally issued It is the duty of the payer to see that payment is made to the proper person and that the signature is valid; he cannot recover the amount of a forged note from the banker who issued the note.<br/></i><br/><br/><b>Traveler\u2019s Cheque</b>:<br/><br/><i>A traveler\u2019s cheque is used in place of hard currency. Denominated in a currency and preprinted, these fixed-amount cheques allow the person signing it to use it instead of cash at accepting businesses. The incentive for merchants and other parties is that as long as the original signature and the signature made at the time the cheque is used are the same, the cheque's issuer will unconditionally guarantee payment of the face amount even if the cheque was fraudulently issued, stolen, or lost. This means that a traveler's cheque can never 'bounce' unless the issuer goes bankrupt and out of business. If a traveler's cheque were lost or stolen, it can be replaced by the issuing financial institution. Banks issuing traveler's cheques earn income from fees and interest for the period that the cheques are uncashed, while not paying any interest to the cheque holder, making them effectively interest-free loans.</i><br/><br/>For game purposes, the goal is to keep it simple. I want to condense the three types down to a single document. So you\u2019ve got two forms of currency: cheques and coins. Cheques handle the large purchases, while coins (say pennies) handle small expenses like a meal or drink at the bar.<br/><br/>One side of your character sheet essentially acts as your signature card (identity, stats, and whatnot) and the other is the letter of credit.<br/><br/>If there is any fantasy /post-apocalyptic game that does something like this, maybe I can draw from that as well.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473926">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473926/#Comment_473926" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-14T19:41:22+00:00" title="May 14, 2018  7:41PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How about the possibilities of magically-enabled block chain?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vgunn" title="vgunn"><img alt="vgunn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vgunn">vgunn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473927/#Comment_473927" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-14T19:45:10+00:00" title="May 14, 2018  7:45PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" rel="nofollow">Adam_Dray</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>How about the possibilities of magically-enabled block chain?</p></div></blockquote>\nCan you explain?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473930/#Comment_473930" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-14T19:53:27+00:00" title="May 14, 2018  7:53PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, yeah.

Blockchain is a modern technology that uses encryption algorithms and distributed computing to produce a system of multiple, verifiable ledgers. Every copy of the ledger contains everything ever done on it, in a way that is very, <i>very</i> difficult to forge. Forgery requires updating <i>everyone's</i> copy of the ledger, not just one ledger.<br/><br/><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin" rel="nofollow">Bitcoin</a> and other cryptocurrency operate using these principles. It's money that is referenced by a set of codes, backed by a public distributed ledger about those codes, secured by encryption. There is no central bank to rob.<br/><br/>Possession of the physical bitcoin matters less than possession of the blockchain data that resides on it. If someone gets the data, though, they still need the owner's <i>private key</i> to do anything with the public data.<br/><br/>In a fantasy setting, you have the keys to those technologies in the form of magic: Replace encryption by magical locking and/or authentication. Replace distributed ledger by some kind of magically copying to everyone's "money book." Replace private keys with true names or magical command words or something. Then you have "Spellcoin," or what-have-you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473933">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mabgriff" title="mabgriff"><img alt="mabgriff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mabgriff">mabgriff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473933/#Comment_473933" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-14T20:01:01+00:00" title="May 14, 2018  8:01PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love this.

(The church takes ordinary wealth in exchange, so money, land, etc. all generally works.) So this is clearly a currency, measured in units of "Purgatory days", traded for gold and such in the form of indulgences. You can even trade it between people by e.g. praying for another person - an intercession, as the church calls it. This is all basically historical.<br/><br/>(In case you're wondering where the initial treasury comes from: apparently Jesus Christ started it when he begat the church body politic, as he obviously had more than enough moral merit for his personal needs - he could afford to share. Later on all the saints of the church have added to the treasury. You have your personal moral merit, you see, but after death and ascension to Heaven, what does that buy you? You might as well pool your moral merit with the other saints so the Church has something to use in forgiving sins on Earth. The living need your merit more than you do!)<br/><br/>So what I did in my campaign was thus:<br/><b>*</b> One point of "Purgatory merit" equals one XP - they're worth the same as money insofar as gaining experience points is concerned. This incidentally means that spiritually oriented characters may be motivated to work for the church in exchange for indulgences.<br/><b>*</b> Adventurers working for worldly goals gain petty sin points alongside experience points; technically speaking they're separate things, but in practice a normal human adventurer will gain 1 point of sin for every point of XP they gain. Lawful and Chaotic types alignment-wise get appropriate multipliers. If the campaign is concerned about this sort of thing, the GM can of course assign appropriate Purgatory penalties for individual actions, too. Sin points counteract merit points on a one for one basis, as you'd expect.<br/><b>*</b> As per Catholic doctrine, your soul's destination at death depends on your status regarding minor and major sins. Minor sins cause you a Purgatory stay that may well extend into centuries in the penal institution before gaining access to Heaven; major - or deadly - sins cause you to be sent directly to Hell. (Your stature in Hell could of course be calculated from your sin/grace point totals, too - like which circle of Hell you end up in, or whatever.) So where your character's soul ends up, and for how long, depends on their state of grace. Very relevant when it comes to e.g. resurrection hijinks and such.<br/><br/>This spiritual merit economy is interesting in that it has many digital currency features. For example, individual bishops can draw on the treasury of merit, which is communal to the whole of Christendom. The church has procedures for doing this, though; presumably - again, as per Catholic doctrine - the divine forces accord with the temporal church in these matters, so if the Pope e.g. forbids individual bishops from granting indulgences (as he did at one point), the divine bank stops granting their letters of credit. All rather straightforward, and if you happen to have divine magicians of some sort, it should be relatively easy for them to use Detect spells and the like to check an individual's bank balance. In a word, moral merit seems like it has the makings to be a pretty good alternative economy for high-level adventurers who might have more planar concerns and less gold-based interests. Much cooler than "astral diamonds" or whatnot, I think.<br/><br/>An important feature of the spirit economy is that it's difficult to cheat the bank, because the "bank" is actually the all-seeing eye of the One God. The "merit points" on your account are actually in the heavenly lectern (presumably updated in real time by angels, or sheer divine power - I haven't seen a clear explanation of this point), and they represent nothing more or less than God's judgement on souls. I don't know why God decided to run a transactional system where you can transfer merit credit from one soul to another one, but apparently he did, so here we are.<br/><br/>My big adventure arc relating to this thought-exercise has never been actually played, but it involves the Reformation interpreted as a heist movie, basically: Philip Melanchton (one of the German protestant guys, nb.) steals a part of the Catholic treasury of merit via theological hijinks, and a counter-reformation bishop hires the player characters to get it back, which probably involves some sort of planar travel at some point of the business. The stakes are high, as a treasury deficit could, worst come to worst, cause a moral bankruptcy in the Catholic church just as the 30-year war is starting to heat up.<br/><br/>I also have another parallel spirit economy in the campaign world involving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joss_paper" rel="nofollow">joss money</a>, used extensively in both Chinese spirit world and by European faeries (independent of each other), but it's not relevant here, because unlike the moral merit it's a commodity currency rather than a credit system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473936/#Comment_473936" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-14T20:43:05+00:00" title="May 14, 2018  8:43PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really like the "merit economy" -- it takes the idea of indulgences or "accumulating merit" in many world religions and reifies it in a very cool way! Also creates some interesting effects on society -- is it worth it doing bad things in order to earn enough merit to buy your way to heaven?

At the beginning of the game, your character doesn\u2019t have much actual money (just 100 cents). What you do carry, however, is a letter of credit (most often referred to as a cheque) worth 20 marks. Any number of  financial institutions, religious organizations, government entities, entrepreneurial endeavors, wealthy benefactors, academia or adventure societies, might issue such cheques. These letters can be used at any business who will accept them (for example, mercantile &amp; sundries shops or outfitters). They\u2019ll authenticate the document with your signature card, then note the amount spent, and notarize it with a special stamp or signet. Almost everything required for an expedition will be paid for with a cheque. 1 Mark is the cost of a common, useful adventuring item (armor, non-magical weapon, a lantern, ten-foot pole, 20-feet of rope, hammer &amp; spikes, et al).<br/><br/>Coin. Only one denomination of currency is minted, aptly called a Cent. These coins are used for necessity goods or to make small purchases (such as a meal at an inn or a drink at a tavern). Cheques can be exchanged for coins at certain places or by select individuals. Keep in mind that carrying a bag of coins around counts as an item in your inventory, and is more vulnerable to theft (a document is easier to hide, but could be counterfeited or forged).<br/><br/>Treasure. Any valuable object you find on your expedition is treasure. You\u2019ll have to haul out treasure and will count an an item in your inventory. Hirelings or pack animals can be used to ease your load\u2014but can be costly and unreliable. Adventurers will want to sell off their treasure (save what you want in your personal collection) as quickly as possible. Bandits are an ever-present problem. Of course, you\u2019ll get far more value for your treasure if it sold in the cosmopolitan cities back east. But the risk of robbery is far greater. Promissory notes are often given to adventurers exchange for treasure, especially from antiquaries and auctioneers. This document is a written promise to pay specific sum of money before a particular date.

How would he cash it in?<br/><br/>So, in a sort of realistic interpretation, these notes/cheques would be a macro-eonomy layered over the real  economy.<br/><br/>So, these were used in traveling during things like the crusades, right? So, a Crusader has a letter of credit, they travel across the countryside with what amounts to a small army. Then they either force a peasant to let their whole entourage sleep for the night or impose on a noble for hospitality. So, no money spent.

Historically it was extensively used by the merchant class and nobility, but that's just because those are the classes with money and a need to travel, not directly because they're wealthy.<br/><br/>Note that "letter of credit" is normally not a loan arrangement between the user and the bank; the bank does not take any risk in it. Rather, the bank sells the letter to the user at a premium, and the user pays because they want to travel with a letter rather than carrying gold. The bank is essentially selling their international connections, because unlike the traveller, the bank <i>does</i> have a semi-regular connection with the banking institutions of far-away cities - regular enough that they can settle any debts between them over time. The only party imparting trust in this system is the bank that receives the letter of credit and exchanges it for real money at the destination, but they're not actually trusting the carrier of the letter so much as they trust the letter's signs and seals, and the fact that the other bank is an established business partner that isn't obviously going to short them for what amounts to petty cash.<br/><br/>A bank does not have an economic reason to prevent adventurers from using letters of credit: if you can pay for one, you can get it. In the campaign context VGunn is considering a beginner adventurer would get their initial funding in the form of a letter of credit undersigned by a patron. This would be simply a promise of payment from the patron to whomever ends up accepting the letter that they'll make good on the expense later.<br/><br/>Thinking about why a local community would run on letters of credit rather than real money: maybe it's a penal colony of some sort, and importing gold is illegal? Maybe there's a malign magical influence that makes it dangerous to bring gold there? Maybe it is a genuine fiat currency situation and there simply isn't any real "gold" anymore (although I would expect there to be just one bank putting out notes in that case). Just being distant from the civilized parts wouldn't be a logical reason, I'd think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473998">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vgunn" title="vgunn"><img alt="vgunn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vgunn">vgunn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473998/#Comment_473998" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-17T00:08:09+00:00" title="May 17, 2018 12:08AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" rel="nofollow">DInDenver</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>I think to make letters of credit a commodity is a sort of revolutionary idea for a medieval/Renaissance setting.

Like, if we wanted to play stuff regarding say for instance poverty, we just showed the PCs saving up money to do stuff, and having trouble affording things and stuff, which for my group and I always worked way way way better than tracking money, because we're not into bookkeeping, especially with non-meta resources                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474086">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lorenzogatti" title="lorenzogatti"><img alt="lorenzogatti" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lorenzogatti">lorenzogatti</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474086/#Comment_474086" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-19T22:01:30+00:00" title="May 19, 2018 10:01PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 19, 2018 10:02PM by lorenzogatti.">edited May 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are at least three different types of fantasy setting in which enough normal, conventionally civilized people use money.<br/>One is the high magic sort in which a magical "blockchain" or an even more fun reliable system (e.g. using time or lifespan as currency, like in certain fiction) can exist. It only needs internal coherence and a suitable flavour.<br/><br/>All other fantasy settings need a much more realistic currency system, and use of letters of credit might or might not be plausible. Many needs of a banking system conflict with traditional features of fantasy worlds:\n<ul><li>People need to not only use money, but to move large amounts of it, over long distances, and quite often. It's far from obvious; even very wealthy people don't have reasons to travel far and/or with money (and most of their wealth is land and buildings). The "market" of adventurers with a dungeon's worth of loot that has to be brought home is likely to be small and undependable.</li><li>It also has to actually be money, fungible enough to allow dematerialization. The sort of things the bad guys want to steal from the good guys or vice versa are rarely so boring.</li><li>Traveling with letters has to be preferable to traveling with treasure. <br/>What if travel is safe from robbers (e.g. common teleportation), carrying treasure is not a problem (e.g. common use of something like the traditional D&amp;D <i>bag of holding</i>), robbers are not a problem (e.g. because some other threat makes intensely defended caravans the norm)?</li><li>People need two linked banks to trust at both ends of their journey. Not going to happen in the unpopulated, uncivilized, foreign areas that attract adventurers.</li><li>Banks require a constant, quick flow of travellers and news.</li><li>Banks need to be safe. If you want to cash in a letter of credit but the bank has recently become a dragon's new gold-filled home, you are in trouble.</li><li>If circulation of money is unbalanced, actual transport of treasure is occasionally unavoidable.</li><li>Magic can facilitate identity theft; easy impersonation makes stealing letters of credit as good as stealing treasure; lack of safety and trust makes letters of credit pointless.</li></ul>\nFor example, consider Middle Earth: people travel long distance, but insanely valuable things (rings, mithril chainmail, the Arkenstone, various swords...) are usually highly portable; moving the only big featured treasure (Smaug's hoard) is completely out of the question; only a handful of cities that could possibly support banks exist, and they are very sparse; most travelers (except maybe hobbits) are far more dangerous than plausible robbers, and as far as they need to move something from point A to point B a letter of credit would be an absurd outsourcing of their adventure.  <br/><br/>Letters of credit can be suitable for nice, prosperous settings that resemble the real world societies in which this kind of banking was actually developed, with global commerce, dense population, common literacy, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
