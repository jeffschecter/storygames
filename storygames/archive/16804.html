Have you experienced it? If so has it been a problem? I'll explain what I mean.<br/><br/>It happens sometimes when you start off a game where the players create their characters prior to the first session. They bring them with them and then share. Some folks write theirs up, some don't, and some people write a novel doing so. That last one is the doll house. It's like being asked to bring some toys to the sand box to play with the other kids, and dragging over your whole own doll house: furniture, dolls, tiny miniature dishes, pets, the works. <br/><br/>It's kind of an anti-social behavior, but one that really doesn't seem like it should be a problem. How awesome is it for the players to get so involved in the game that they make up all this great shit before you even start? But it can gum up the works terribly. Are the other players supposed to read the novel? Is the GM supposed to take it in and incorporate the material that's been created into the world they have created? Or get the other players on board? Why do you get to have us play in your doll house? Weren't we here to build sand castles together?<br/><br/>Of course, I'm describing this in terms of a traditional game. Where there is a GM, who shares a world, with players who aren't involved or empowered to make it along with them. Many, many story games nip this in the bud by making all the players create the world and their characters together. Going round the table, each person gets to have input that's fairly equally weighted. But it can still happen there. In fact, the egalitarian nature of games where you've got a more distributed authority among the players opens the door to people getting deeply inspired about something in the world. Then the other players, and perhaps a GM, have to make decisions about how to deal with it. And if that person spends so much time in their own dollhouse, they can get isolated and not help build the shared experience that the others are there for. The more collaborative and improv'ed the game is, the more everyone relies on having the creative support of all the players engaged. It can suck energy out of the shared play.<br/><br/>On the other side of the coin, some of the most deeply satisfying games I've been in have been open invitations to doll house. But then, everyone wanted to spend time in each other's houses. Bring on high tea with those tiny, tiny dishes. That was what the game was about: exploring the worlds that the others had framed, and fleshing them out by playing characters within them. <br/><br/>I'm curious to see if this is a common issue. And how it works out for other people.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383518">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383518/#Comment_383518" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-26T23:19:37+00:00" title="June 26, 2012 11:19PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/>My first question is to what degree this behaviour is distinct from 'pre-playing' one's character. Is it a sub-set, or a branch off some earlier ur-tree? It sounds like dollhousing is more about coming to the game with a whole lot of your character's environment (and entourage) already built up in advance, as opposed to coming to the game with all the character's crucial story-decisions already made. That seems like an interesting distinction. Can a game help a player avoid one, while still encouraging (or failing to adequately discourage) the other?<br/><br/>In any case you have described almost precisely the dominant mode of roleplay on online MU* (MUSH, MUX) environments, at least circa 1995-2002 -- which also happened to be my formative 'serious roleplaying' years. These mostly-freeform games (also mostly-WoD) consisted almost entirely of everybody building their most elaborate, multi-faceted, well-manicured dollhouse/diorama/backstoried characters and then taking turns showing them off to each other. <br/><br/>Consequently, oh yes -- I do this all the time. So, so much. A lot less now, of course, but many of the same impulses remain strong even when playing games specifically designed to avoid this sort of behaviour.<br/><br/>And one thing I will say is that while I agree there is some part of dollhousing that results from a genuine, personal enthusiasm about one's creation, I think it only gets to truly pathological levels when you add to that a distrust or even paranoia concerning what your fellow-players will do to/with your character, if you don't pre-emptively paint in every last detail.<br/><br/>This was definitely my experience with online play, at least. So few of my fellow-players -- and there were hundreds of them on a typical MU* -- seemed to share even my general aesthetic, let alone the slightest investment in my particular character, and so I rapidly discovered that one of the best ways to get the sort of play I wanted was to create fully-realized 'sets' -- actual places, yes, but also NPCs and archetypal situations and bits of dialogue/interaction -- and then just wait until another player wandered into them. The more fully-formed I could make the starting situation, and the more avenues I had to demonstrate the sort of tone I was interested in, the better the odds that the other player would fall in line (or more generously, would have a chance of understanding what I was interested in.)<br/><br/>For example, I would frequently create extremely detailed places of work for my characters, complete with like a full-network-sitcom list of NPC cast members, each of whom I would make as (or more) detailed as many of the other PCs -- backstories, personality, and most importantly a sort of generalized repertoire of interaction. I often played scenes where I was controlling my own PC as well as one or two NPCs -- not interacting with myself, but rather doubling up on the vectors by which I could interact with the other players, the better to demonstrate the sort of play I wanted. And, theoretically, the better to attract interested players through a wider variety of 'hooks' into my own character's story.<br/><br/>In other words, crazy-ass control freak behaviour. That everybody aspired to, appreciated, and generally tried to imitate. Because the thing about playing with 100 fellow-players instead of 4 is that it actually <i>isn't</i> very reasonable to expect them to be all that invested in your character, or to have any sort of understanding of what sort of world you are imagining them living in. So if you have high expectations for continuity and consistency between all your character's scenes, the only person who is going to bring that to the table is you -- and sometimes you are going to have to bring it extremely aggressively to the table, or another player will unwittingly kick a hole in the wall of your dollhouse, because that's where they figured the door was supposed to be.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383522/#Comment_383522" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-26T23:37:05+00:00" title="June 26, 2012 11:37PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is this different than when the GM brings a 20 page setting document?

See, but what you are leaving out is that in a trad game, you really need to call the GM up ahead of time so you can bounce ideas off of them. Once you tell them about your character, and get their buy-in, and infect them with your story creation, then it will ensure your precious is woven into the fabric of the world. If the GM is on your side, no one can play wrong. When those less enthusiastic players show up, they'll have to latch onto you.

I tend to do this when I write fiction. I can spend days in a character's head before she lands on paper. Once there, characters have to adapt to the environment I threw them into. <br/><br/>In games, I do this to some extent after the first or second session. I start thinking about a character deeply, about her background, about things that wouldn't come up in a game, but when I bring her back to the table, any of those things that I've imagined in her background that are incompatible with the other players' concept of the world, their characters, or my character, I drop so that my character can fit into the shared fiction.<br/><br/>On reflection of my own dollhousing behavior and my observations of others doing it, I'd say it's potentially anti-social, but when it's dysfunctional it's generally just self-indulgent. Is this more <i>potentially</i> anti-social? I have seen this behavior work well when players have short sessions, or when dollhousers move their furniture around to accommodate others. Then again, I have played with someone who did this in an annoying way because the player had a difficult time merging their concept of their character with the pre-established world. Ultimately the character was anti-social (a typical mode for the player) and difficult for others to engage with. There were other non-game factors at play though. The dollhousing was more like the cherry on top.<br/><br/>On the flip side, I think this is very common in larps, but it's the GM who dollhouses, and the players have to buy into their roles. I've seen this work well and fail miserably. I've also played table-top games with one GM who does this for every game she runs. I find that if there are qualities about my character that I just don't like I downplay them, and it's mostly not a big deal. <br/><br/>So for example, there was this Vampire: tR game where the players were assigned pre-gen characters. The GM took us aside and told us how we were all embraced and what you clan was. We picked our names, and I got to pick my flaw, but that was about it. I ended up with a Nosferatu. I really, really didn't want to play a Nos. If I'm going to play V:tR, I do not want to be a disgusting vampire, so I gave my Nos dude a beautiful and romantic name. His flaw was that he was so handsome that he looked unreal and doll like, so perfectly charming, yet he triggered people's serial killer radar. So he was disgusting in a way I could play, but fit the image of the type of vampire I prefer to play. The GM didn't expect the beautiful serial killer flaw, I think it might have clashed with some of her plans, but we managed to merge our notions of this character.<br/><br/>So to answer the questions (maybe rhetorical?), dollhousing can be a pretty neat and effective thing when you're master and commander of the characters and setting, as in creative writing. As long as the fiction you create in your dollhouse is mutable and you're willing to alter the character to fit better into the shared space, it's pretty cool to have and play with a well-developed character who has baggage and history that may never come up (like in real life relationships). It's dysfunctional when the doll house is inflexible.<br/><br/>So my question is how do we as spectators and participants and community members help doll housing players let us in to do rearranging so that we can have fun, too? <br/><br/>And is it a bad thing for a GM to do this? I know I hate getting character sheets longer than 2 pages when I larp, and I've been trying over the past couple larps I've written to create open ended characters with char sheets no longer than a page. The last game I did I had a couple of players who initially had a tough time with this, but at game, this creative license for the players was perfect for the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383534">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383534/#Comment_383534" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-27T00:43:17+00:00" title="June 27, 2012 12:43AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>On the other side of the coin, some of the most deeply satisfying games I've been in have been open invitations to doll house.

I really like that term, too, "Doll House".<br/><br/>I'm thinking that there might be two subsets of this behavior, the "Open Doll House" and "Closed Doll House", for lack of better terms...<br/><br/>In both cases, someone comes to Session One with a long backstory on their character. And the character is definitely "my character", with a lot of behaviors determined not by the story, but like most classic RPG by only the will of the player ("My character wouldn't do that", etc).<br/><br/>In the Open Doll House, the player makes up a lot of backstory, but fully leaves open anything that pertains to adventuring or interacting with other PCs. In other words, the long backstory that ultimately might not really mean much -- at all -- in play, but is there to not only flesh out the character, but to help the player come to understand/immerse into her. The player puts "getting along with the other characters, progressing the story/adventure" above "my character's story", so leaves a lot of points of potential contention open (in other words, doesn't create backstory/behavior that would create conflict with the other PCs, or with the flow of the story/adventure.<br/><br/>In the Closed Doll House the player does the same but puts "my character's story" above "getting along with the other characters, progressing the story/adventure". The long backstory still might not come out much in play, but in this case... sometimes the player brings things into the game through the character's actions that hints at the backstory or character secrets in a way that doesn't make sense to the other players or GM (unless they read the 10 pages of backstory). It may or may not shiv the scenario a little, as the PC turns left instead of right, or interacts poorly with key NPCs because of something they wrote in their backstory. <br/><br/>In both cases, the other players really have no authorship into that character's backstory, it's all set up and ready to use (nothing to "make").<br/><br/>At the very least, I've definitely seen Doll Housing, and within that these two kind of distinct styles of "doll housing" to boot.<br/><br/>Interesting!<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383539/#Comment_383539" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-27T02:44:16+00:00" title="June 27, 2012  2:44AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 27, 2012 2:56AM by vulpinoid.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi, My name is Michael...and I'm a Doll Houser.<br/><br/>I should clarify this, by adding another identifying axis to the doll house matrix...Sharing and Possessive. <br/><br/>On this axis, I'd be a Sharing Doll-houser and my wife would be a Possessive Doll-houser. Depending on the game, we might be open or closed...but mostly we start closed and gradually reveal what is necessary when the time is right.

Said backgrounds seldom came into play, and only when the GM felt like using them as plot hooks, so they came into play on the GM's terms and never on players' terms. This often resulted in something the player didn't want for her character, but that GM ignored protests.<br/>Needless to say, that group didn't last long. After that dollhousing wasn't actively encouraged but I was used to it, so I kept on writing backgrounds, even of chaacters I never played afterwards. It was fun to write and imagine ideas. Which could have turned in full fledged fiction, now that I think of it.<br/>Mind you, I still prefer preparing my characters beforehand, usually. But I don't go further than the character sheet requires. However when a game requires that I write down traits or descriptive bits (not just filling stats, that is), I find it easier to come up with ideas I find interesting when I don't need to rush because we need to start the game. Not that this qualifies as dollhousing, but maybe it's still a legacy of that period of my gaming life...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383554/#Comment_383554" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-27T06:36:24+00:00" title="June 27, 2012  6:36AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the related danger in GMless or collaborative play is the narrative doll house - playing before you play.

It's clearer to me now. And just to be clear, it can happen at any time in play--a pre-written character background is just an obvious moment for it to occur. Non-trad games that have a lot of GM-player dyad in them can end up allowing player isolation in a similar way.<br/><br/>Open and closed doll housing seems just right. It can add a tremendous amount of depth to a world to have people invest that much creativity into it, but there has to be some kind of functional way for the information to flow to the other participants, and for there to be a way for them to interact with it once it has been communicated. Possessive vs. Sharing shows us what kind of gate-keeping happens. <br/><br/>Pre-play is a related but separate issue. It can be similarly jarring but is often integrated right in there with collaboratively created elements. And, perhaps even more aggressively, it means that someone is telling <b>you</b> how to play with your toys, too. When GMs do it, we sometimes call that rail-roading.   <br/><br/>Julia wrote:<br/><i>On reflection of my own dollhousing behavior and my observations of others doing it, I'd say it's <b>potentially</b> anti-social, but when it's dysfunctional it's generally just self-indulgent. Is this more potentially anti-social? I have seen this behavior work well when players have short sessions, or when dollhousers move their furniture around to accommodate others.</i><br/><br/>Yes, it doesn't have to be anti-social! Great point. The anti-social aspect of doll-housing is in the very simple sense that one doesn't socialize <i>creatively</i> with the other players. Maybe "socially isolating" is a less loaded way to describe it.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383562">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383562/#Comment_383562" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-27T08:27:23+00:00" title="June 27, 2012  8:27AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've not encountered this much, certainly not in an overt way but there's also a sort of hidden dolls' house which occurs. This is when a player clearly has an agenda for their character, they will behave in a certain way or go after specific goals, however they never tell the other players exactly what these are. Sometimes it's even apparent that the player themself is not aware of their agenda, and they pursue it in an ill-defined way, being obstructive to other play because they know they want something and it's not what's happening now.<br/><br/>There's also a half-way house between building a background in secret and doing it together. Night's Black Agents requires the characters to be ex-agents caught up in a vampire conspiracy. Characters have a drive, which is why they might be fighting the vampires (revenge, duty etc) and also a background on which service employed them and to what end (American assassin, Russian hacker, French dilletante, ...).<br/>At the start, the characters don't necessarily know each other but are on a joint mission which reveals the conspiracy. The group is required to handle this quite carefully, ensuring that the drives and agendas of the agents don't overshadow the conspiracy. There are some guidelines in the book on how this can be achieved, chief of which is to threaten everyone with something worse than they imagined and hence to develop a common, immediate and very threatening enemy but there are subtler ways.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383576/#Comment_383576" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-27T10:41:35+00:00" title="June 27, 2012 10:41AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So I was at MACE a few years back, and one of the GMs brought "The Adventures of Baron Munchhausen" except we played it off as "Strong Bad Emails" instead.  Cute, quirky, potential for greatness.<br/><br/>And greatness it was.  He even brought props.  The Homestar Runner site produced some mini figs that were on the table for spice.  As the game went, we would pick up the figs in the current story and move them about, talking through them.  Not just the player who's turn it was, mind you, other people would insert themselves, grab a fig, and interrupt with some comment or snark that should be worked in.<br/><br/>Until a very clear line was crossed.  One of the players started grabbing figs from other people, and having a many sided conversation all by themselves, oblivious to the rest of us, eyes fixed on the plastic toys...  Which continued for some long moments, leaving the rest of us to nervously shift our eyes towards one another, unable to figure out what had changed so suddenly.<br/><br/>We went for another round of the game after that, thinking "Maybe it was just an accident, or something.  I'm sure it won't happen again."  But no, the same player, the same behavior.<br/><br/>It's that shameless disregard for the other people at the table, the almost manic need to play by yourself, but have others watch.  It was super creepy, and felt anti-social.  And at the same time, it made us think hard about our own habits, having them cranked to 11 in front of us.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383581">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383581/#Comment_383581" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-27T11:17:38+00:00" title="June 27, 2012 11:17AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yikes, that's pretty creepy Arnold.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383585">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner" title="Evan_Torner"><img alt="Evan_Torner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/278/nHOYP3VNJB6A6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner">Evan_Torner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383585/#Comment_383585" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-27T11:56:14+00:00" title="June 27, 2012 11:56AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">@Emily_Care</a>: Just to be clear, Emily \u2013 doll housing would then be analogous to "pre-play," only with a precocious sort of value ascribed to the outcomes of pre-play?<br/><br/>"No, no \u2013\xa0you couldn't be my character's brother.

In a way it was a gift that the minis were there. It was completely visible that the person was both no longer engaging with the other players, <b>and</b> that they were crossing lines with respect to narrating for the other peoples' characters. I'd really love to have a way to talk about this, too! <br/><br/>I've experienced this a few times in games recently, where the lines of collaboration shifted to far, and instead of everyone suggesting what might happen, or even what someone else's character might do, it became a matter of being <b>told</b> what your character was doing. Now, of course, in some games that is built in (ie PtA the holder of the high card says what happens, everyone accepts it and the action moves on) but there are specific moments when this is allowed, generally. Playing non-trad games people can lose sight of the normative boundaries (ie I say what my character does, you say about yours) and push past.  <br/><br/><i>Just to be clear, Emily \u2013 doll housing would then be analogous to "pre-play," only with a precocious sort of value ascribed to the outcomes of pre-play?<br/><br/>"No, no \u2013 you couldn't be my character's brother. His name is Thamryn and he owns a barber shop across the bridge."</i><br/>Good question. How I define pre-play is saying what events will occur during play, similar to what Jason talked about up above. <br/><br/>OH! I can pull out some of my favorite new terminology to get at this.  Doll housing has the players creating restrictive <i>constraints</i> through <i>affordances</i> in the game world that they have created on their own. (These are concepts that Eirik Fatland discussed at Solmukohta.) Evan, in your example, the player who says "no my brother is a barber across the bridge" is constraining what someone else can add to the fiction. The affordance is their assertion about who &amp; what the brother is already defined to be. <br/><br/>So in an open Doll house you've got constraints with openings for other to build on them and ascribe meaning (a mandalorian, if  you will). The Share-friendly Dollhouser will be open to offers and affordances made by others about the things they've created.You might even create the "hooks" that up-thread IceCreamEmperor talked about in the MUs. (Great examples by the way!) <br/><br/>Possessive dollhousers would resist the affordances of others, like the example of Vulpinoid's wife:<br/><i>As a possessive doll-houser, my wife writes her character history to barricade herself from the outside and justify her actions in game even when a more social form of behaviour might be more conducive to play.</i><br/>And I can well imagine the real world game experiences that would inspire someone to take this approach! Doll housing is absolutely affective in  motivation, but and defensiveness can be a motivating factor that leads to isolation and creative dysfunction.<br/><br/>So back to the pre-play question. In pre-play, you create affordances not only about what has happened in the world, but about what will happen in the future. You've got your story mapped out. So you're creating constraints on the affordances of others based on what events you want to unfold: "no my character wouldn't do that", "no that's a stupid turn of events", etc. <br/><br/>Doll housing gives you a basis upon which to do so. I think of that kind of affordance as "establishing". If I've established that my brother is a barber with a shop across the bridge, then everyone is blocked from making him be one of the pirates we fought, who tried to kill me. My affordance carries forward, and constrains what everyone else can say. This can be a currency for pre-play. "No, that evil wizard can't be my brother, he's just a simple barber!"                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonT" title="JasonT"><img alt="JasonT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonT">JasonT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383598/#Comment_383598" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-27T12:47:08+00:00" title="June 27, 2012 12:47PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great observations here. I used to have a problem with "closed doll housing," but I'm getting better at communicating with players during character creation to encourage "open doll housing" (or even just coming up with simple character concepts that will fit with what we're doing better). <br/><br/>I don't mind if someone shows up with a detailed back story so long as the character fits with the premise of the entire game, consciously building in hooks for what the player knows we'll be doing. I don't even really mind if it's really self-indulgent. I only mind when doll housing makes it harder for me (as the GM) to figure out how to fit the character into the story at all. When you're running a game of In Nomine, where all the characters are angels in good standing being sent out on goody-two-shoes missions, it's really difficult to fit in that one guy who's been outcast from Heaven and carries around a bag of grenades (but no, no, see, he's got this detailed back story to explain WHY he needs the grenades...).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383600">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mostlyjoe" title="mostlyjoe"><img alt="mostlyjoe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/285/nVQ8MX37HELA3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mostlyjoe">mostlyjoe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383600/#Comment_383600" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-27T12:49:00+00:00" title="June 27, 2012 12:49PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This thread has me thinking of a game where you build a character and then a 'world' they come from.

There was a long-time player (on the right), a huge fan/longtime player/and one of the illustrators of the game and supplements (middle), and the lady on the left. It was her first time playing an RPG, EVER.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-jgE8m0WKqPI/T5wA8cndggI/AAAAAAAAFAM/5iR-Wx1tr2s/s720/IMAGE_EEC592C1-F71B-4BAF-A6AD-7A16AF16DC7F.JPG"/><br/><br/>Anyway, this was her first time playing, although she read a lot about role-playing and stuff before. She came to the table with her own character (which was pretty fine, actually; because the rest of us had played before and knew how it all worked, we crafted our characters at the table right then and there, she definitely read the rules and took her time on her own). The character was a minstrel, and basically there was a backstory to everything: Where he came from, what his pet baby lizard looked like, the reasons for the colors of his clothes, and so on. Illustrations of the gear, doodles, character sketches, etc.<br/><br/>Luckily, it was that sort of thing that was hinted at, and if we asked for more she would tell us more.<br/><br/>The rest of us were impressed, but also hoping that she wouldn't be upset if not a lot of that were to come out in-game. Kinda nervous, too, because this was her first session ever and we wanted her to walk away with a good impression (she did!).<br/><br/>But more to the point, this was the "open dollhousing" that I mentioned above: Everything had backstory and illustrations, and some of it came out in play in measured amounts as detail (and was indistinguishable from her drawing upon her pre-written backstory, and us with our improving the same kinds of details). None of it got in the way of the adventure, or provoked conflict with other characters; and in fact a lot of it was towards making the character a part of a group of people.<br/><br/>This was a relief, as I've seen a lot of that "closed dollhousing" before (especially in Vampire, Mage and the like) and this wasn't like that at all, despite its origins as "writing a lot of backstory for your character".<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383607">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383607/#Comment_383607" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-27T13:17:29+00:00" title="June 27, 2012  1:17PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Doll housing seems similar to spotlight hogging.

Great way to make doll housing a central, constructive component of play. <br/><br/>That reminds me that there's something to be said here about setting and canon. Published settings are dollhoused mansions of fiction. And what makes them open is that they are accessible to everyone--you can read the text to get a similar understanding of the world. Canon is used in fandom online nar worlds to inform the affordances of players. For example, "Yes, we are playing in a world where Harry &amp; Ron get together, rather than Ron &amp; Hermione. Keep it straight!" (so to speak) <br/><br/>But seriously, the shared fictional texts are what everyone plays off of. You can point to Tolkien to describe how long it will take you to cross the lands of Rohan, or how unscalable the black gate of Mordor is. A shared setting is a shared resource. Player generated fiction that is only in  your head, on the other hand, is very inaccessible. More of an unshared resource by its very nature.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383617">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383617/#Comment_383617" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-27T14:04:00+00:00" title="June 27, 2012  2:04PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I think a positive spin on dollhousing might be a good thing. <br/><br/>But the inherent practice leads to disappointment when playing a lot of games in your new paradigm. I have a lot of new players coming to games like Fiasco or Primetime with very involved backstories, very little of which emerge in play. I try to warn them that these games require making things up on the fly or back-filling elements.<br/><br/>At times, I've had players create a bulleted list of elements they want to add when they are really attached to their involved characters (a technique I got from With Great Power...)

The fact that Mel is totally addicted to Tic-Tacs may not come up in the spoken play, but it impacts the fiction by the pure virtue of the PC knowing it. (Whoa!)<br/><br/>The most elegant example of this withheld fiction is an in-game poker game played by larp characters. The player knows the character is gambling their house or their kids' college fund or whatever, but they can neither mention this fact nor can they even drop the poker face they're keeping so that they maintain their advantage. Thus the first person audience makes self-sufficient fiction that nevertheless plays a part in the fiction (like if the character gets so stressed out over the game that they pull a gun or something).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383690/#Comment_383690" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-27T23:18:24+00:00" title="June 27, 2012 11:18PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's true.

Inner play must be a component here.</blockquote>\nFor a lot of people, yeah. Me, for example: over the years, I've wandered from one extreme to the other, and eventually realized that (as with a lot of things), what works for me depends on the group, on the game, and on what I personally want.<br/><br/>These days, for example, I think about my characters a lot and build various elaborate mental dollhouses for them that I have absolutely no intention of ever writing down or presenting to anyone else, because it's something fun I can do by myself during the week. Then Saturday rolls around and we get together and play, and I just let all that thought sit quietly in the back of my mind. Sometimes it informs my play, sometimes it's material I can put out into the game where other people can see it, sometimes it has nothing at all to do with the game, and sometimes it's 100% wrong for the game in every possible way and I discard it as useless...and that's fine, because I honestly don't care one way or the other if anyone else ever realizes that material exists. It's for <i>me</i> first, and for other people only if/when I see a good opportunity to share it.<br/><br/>What I show to other people outside of the actual game is closer to an executive summary of what I think they need to know. Personality notes on my character, a sketchy bullet-point style outline of what kinds of things he does, maybe a few sentence fragments about any relevant history, and then a short list of things that I'm interested in seeing in the game as a player. (Seriously, I could probably fit it all on an index card without even writing small or using the other side.) It's entirely possible that they don't even suspect that I've got various elaborate stories about the character's childhood, his likes and dislikes, significant conversations he's had, his opinions on politics and pop culture and everything else, what's in his wardrobe, what's on his iPod, etc., etc...and unless something actually comes up in the game that makes me think, "Oh, I've got the perfect thing for that," I'm certainly not going to tell 'em any of it.<br/><br/>There's one downside that I've seen, and that's not giving the GM appropriate raw material to build personal hooks for my character on. I do sort of enjoy that sort of thing, but our group has been hovering around 5-6 players for a while, and I haven't been very happy with the experience of doing character-specific spotlight stuff in that context. It feels like the wrong kind of self-indulgence, the kind that takes valuable spotlight time away from the other players, while private dollhousing hits the same desire for self-indulgent ME-focused play without actually impacting the rest of the group at all. My character in a game session is focused on the other characters and on whatever the main story is, while the character in the dollhouse in my head has personal moments and private stories that no one else ever hears about, and I'm good with that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonT" title="JasonT"><img alt="JasonT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonT">JasonT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383700/#Comment_383700" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-28T02:19:37+00:00" title="June 28, 2012  2:19AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is it really such a big deal if a character's pre-planned but minor quirks never come up during play?

It's just a natural part of the process of getting into characters' heads and feeling comfortable with the logic of your own fictional world. <br/><br/>I guess maybe I'd be irked as a GM if I felt like I was trying to work wintergreen Tic Tacs into every adventure and my player never took the bait \u2013\xa0why bother telling the GM, anyway? \u2013\xa0but I don't think it's unreasonable to leave some of those character decorations in the doll house's attic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tore_V" title="Tore_V"><img alt="Tore_V" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tore_V">Tore_V</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383706/#Comment_383706" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-28T04:55:41+00:00" title="June 28, 2012  4:55AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my old campaign we were actively encouraged by the GM to create elaborate backstories.

They're just not that geeky I guess.<br/><br/>However, when it comes to Play By Post games, I often have the problem of in-game doll housing. In other words, some people would write a novel with every post, when everyone else would write a paragraph or two. Personally, I love have backstory available, but usually the middle of the game session is not the time to share it. One example of this was a player who decided to create a notably anime-style brooding loner. Almost every post he wrote had a lengthy flashback that really detracted from the game. I had to ask him privately to tone down the flashbacks because they really seemed to me (and a few others) like ego stroking. <br/><br/>Then again, I felt bad asking someone to be "less into" the game.

It didn't even occur to me that someone's character might be private until I was curious about something, leaned over to look at his character sheet and he snatched it away.<br/><br/>I'm musing on where dollhouses come from.  These factors clearly aren't common to all games, groups, or players.<br/><br/>1. Solo creativity: Collaboration necessarily involves conflict, so for the introverted and/or conflict-avoidant, writing it all up beforehand gives you freedom you might not experience in the group.  I'm both of these things, but that got channeled into my GMing - pre-prepared locations, mostly.  (It was implied before, but I think a GM patiently preparing a dungeon is the counterpart of a player patiently writing up their back story.)<br/><br/>2. Your Role, My Role - D&amp;D's class system gives players a pre-packaged hero's journey, available to them regardless of the nature or quality of the GM's pre-prepared plot.  As long as it provides XP, the specifics of the adventure are irrelevant, just as the specifics of the characters are irrelevant to the module.  The plot is the GM's arena, the character is the player's arena.<br/><br/>3. But since many games (old school games in particular) leave the <b>emotional/relational dimension completely unexamined</b>, there's a clear void if you're feeling inspired by heroic fiction.  So the player fills this in, and has no reason to expect that anybody should complain or want a say, even the GM.  The GM feels good because the player seems to be investing in the game, but not in any way that requires the GM to make any compromises.  In a setup like this, dollhouses can grow arbitrarily rich and involved, to whatever extent the player likes.<br/><br/>3. A character backstory might fill a player need to inject some sense of personal motivation, emotion or relationships into a game that's all about fighting.  Since it has no mechanical consequence whatsoever, it's all harmless, so it can grow arbitrarily rich and involved, perhaps.<br/><br/>4. "Aiming for cool".  Any social activity of consequence (e.g. being visibly creative) can affect your social standing.  If the group doesn't have good safety outlets (e.g. an established trust level that a player could say, "Hah, that speech I just gave sucked! What an anticlimax, I'm embarassed.")  Vampire LARPs in particular are tricky because of the in-character emphasis and the "pecking order in conflict" genre.  But in any game, LARP or otherwise, half the players are going to deliver a below-median performance, by definition.  Having an untouchable backstory where you're the hero is a sort of psychological armor.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383843">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383843/#Comment_383843" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-28T22:49:31+00:00" title="June 28, 2012 10:49PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The problem with dollhouses (and that is a wonderful term, by the way) that I see coming up over and over again is that they are extremely private.

(I doubt the answer, if there is one, will have anything to do with getting everyone to collaborate on that backstory, because that's kind of what the person who builds the dollhouse is specifically not doing.)<br/><br/>And the second question should be whether it is more fun for everyone to spend time with a long and involved backstory as opposed to, say, a long and involved current story that everyone at the table gets to participate in?  <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383851/#Comment_383851" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-29T02:11:18+00:00" title="June 29, 2012  2:11AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe a game in which the creation of the long involved backstory creates a situation where flashbacks to that story are played out with the creator of the backstory as a GM/producer figure.

This thread has suggested a number of different motivations or reasons players might have for doing this sort of creative work in the first place -- and more to the point, a number of different reasons they might not be sharing it.<br/><br/>For example, I suggested that one reason not to want to share -- share in an interactive, rather than demonstrative* way, I mean -- is not trusting your fellow-players, and being concerned that if they get to have real control over these aspects of your character then they will fuck them up in some way, and make your experience of the game less fun. This is obviously a very different situation than one where the player would like to share their dollhouse, but doesn't understand how to do so (or how to do so productively) in the context of the game.<br/><br/>In the former case, it might be helpful to have special-case rules (e.g. for flashback scenes) where the Dollhouse-owner has particular authority over contributions, and the other players can contribute in a limited manner -- this could open the door to the players' building trust with each other, so that the Dollhouse-protective player might start to allow those elements to enter into general play as well, where they can become part of the fully-interactive story.<br/><br/><br/>* Interactive = letting other players address or modify or affect your dollhouse. Demonstrative = letting other players look at and admire your dollhouse. I think a lot of players who like to dollhouse would love to have opportunities for the latter, but would be adamantly opposed to the former.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383860/#Comment_383860" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-29T06:15:16+00:00" title="June 29, 2012  6:15AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 29, 2012 6:22AM by Graham.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why see this as pathological?

Then, (s)he just sits back and asks questions.  A goal could be to insert yourself into other peoples' backstories (fiction is full of these times where people look back and don't realize they were in the same place at the same time) and to do world building that stitches their backstories together. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383876">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383876/#Comment_383876" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-29T09:46:40+00:00" title="June 29, 2012  9:46AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hrm. Isn't some of this dollhousing a bit like an inversion of traditional style game GMing?<br/><br/>Is there maybe something to be learned by looking at it through that particular lens?<br/><br/>What I mean is, someone who does this big bit of backstory work about a single character is really doing a lot of work like a GM in a traditional game. They're creating background and setting and in some way trying to get the other participants to interact with it, right?<br/><br/>The main difference is that they're centering it around a certain character.<br/><br/>Annd maybe that isn't even all that crazy really. In almost every other form of fiction, the action of a story tends to focus around one main character. Even fiction that has several key characters tends to shift around and focus on them for a bit, and often they still tend to have a primary character they focus on, only slowly building outwards from that main character.<br/><br/>Sorry, i don't really have a solution exactly. I guess I'm more suggesting that maybe the solution to positive dollhousing is to run with it rather than try to nip it in the bud.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383880">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383880/#Comment_383880" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-29T10:21:54+00:00" title="June 29, 2012 10:21AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>I'm most interested in Emily's last paragraph.

It was lovely.\n<blockquote>However, when it comes to Play By Post games, I often have the problem of in-game doll housing.

Showing how it can crop up mid game is harder than pointing to pre-game. In the play by mail it feels like a spot light issue as well (someone is taking up more time/space/energy than the others). It is interesting that when introduced before the game in this case, it would have been less problematic.<br/><br/>I like the fact that we are looking at both the good and the bad of this phenomenon here.  \n<blockquote>Interactive = letting other players address or modify or affect your dollhouse. Demonstrative = letting other players look at and admire your dollhouse. I think a lot of players who like to dollhouse would love to have opportunities for the latter, but would be adamantly opposed to the former.</blockquote>\nExcellent additions. Here's a roundup:<br/><br/>Dollhouse = fictional material created by a player that is above and beyond the material shared by others. <br/><br/>Open Dollhouse = this fiction that can be affected and changed by other players<br/>Closed Dollhouse = this fiction that cannot be affected by anyone but the original author<br/><br/>Sharing Dollhouser = a player who wants to share and have interplay about their dollhoused material with other players<br/>Possessive Dollhouser = a player who wants to control, and perhaps not let others know about this material<br/><br/>Interactive = an approach or aspect of the fiction that lets someone other than the original author fictionally "enter" an Open dollhouse and change, modify or respond to it. <br/>Demonstrative = an approach or aspect of the fiction that lets the information be known by and shared with other players.\n<blockquote>I am experiencing this to a certain extent with a new player - she has been playing a character in another campaign that she adores. LOVES. Now she's bringing that character to my game. My game is one huge dollhouse, but I've decided to be OK about that. It's huge, and it's open, though, and I do my best to make it about the players. BUT....there's this character with all this juice *in someone else's game* and I'm very concerned now that her dollhouse will not be open to the rest of us. I really should ask for original characters from my players, but I wanted to indulge this one because it's a new group and a new game....gah. I think I will speak to her and let her know that really, we need to have the doors opened and hopefully we won't break any tiny chandeliers.</blockquote>\nA tricky situation!

I don't think someone who builds a dollhouse necessarily wants to get other participants to interact with it. At least, there are plenty of reasons why someone would build a dollhouse that either have nothing to do with getting other people to climb into it, or are actually completely opposed to having other people climb into it. Not everyone who builds an elaborate backstory for their character is doing it as a way of seizing the spotlight, or are even interested in trying to cram all of that backstory into the game.<br/><br/>(And if they ARE interested in doing exactly that, that's when I think you start to see the problems. But I think there's a lot of positive things that players can get out of dollhousing that never even approach crossing over into problematic territory.)\n<blockquote>The main difference is that they're centering it around a certain character.<br/><br/>Annd maybe that isn't even all that crazy really. In almost every other form of fiction, the action of a story tends to focus around one main character. Even fiction that has several key characters tends to shift around and focus on them for a bit, and often they still tend to have a primary character they focus on, only slowly building outwards from that main character.<br/><br/>Sorry, i don't really have a solution exactly. I guess I'm more suggesting that maybe the solution to positive dollhousing is to run with it rather than try to nip it in the bud.</blockquote>\nI'm totally with you on that.

It might not change the feelings of imbalance, but would certainly make it easier to get up to speed.\n<blockquote>I don't think someone who builds a dollhouse necessarily wants to get other participants to interact with it.

Per the comparison to spotlight hogging above, we're seeing that there are many ways it can roll out. Dollhousing can lead to attention hogging, but it need not.

I could draw on this to decide what happened when players did something I wasn't expecting, but also, I started to feel frustrated, because I reached a place where I wanted the players to be able to interact with all this extra detail but couldn't figure out how to bring into play at the table. It was my own doll house.<br/>I'm sure a lot of trad GMs will have had a similar experience, especially those who have run illusionist or participationist games I imagine.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383914">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383914/#Comment_383914" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-29T15:24:18+00:00" title="June 29, 2012  3:24PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Are dollhouses related to oppressive social footprint?  </blockquote>\nI would venture to say that they can be but aren't always.<br/><br/>One way that they can be - You have a game with a lot of specific setting background stuff. You have a player who doesn't want to care about all that. They want to do creative setting construction themselves. So they write up a background for their character that doesn't neatly fit in with the rest of the setting stuff. It's just the stuff that they got inspired by and thought was cool.<br/><br/>Then they bring that character with that background into game.<br/><br/>Some level of friction usually occurs.<br/><br/>I've seen this happen A LOT in medium sized fantasy larps. Especially ones that start out with vague backgrounds that aren't well fleshed out yet. And they're more desperate at the start to build up a player base than they are to implement a creative vision.<br/><br/>I've seen 2 games do a really good job of reducing this problem substantially. They both did so by forcing every player, as part of their character creation process, to make a country/race choice that had both a cultural and character stat impact. (Yes the process was imperfect and represented a certain amount of cultural appropriation among the cultures that were amalgamated into fantasy analogues. But the result was 50 billion times better than the alternative, so I'll take it as a net positive.)<br/><br/>Note - this is very much not the same as choosing a class/race in the vast vast vast majority of D&amp;D campaigns where such things are poorly defined and don't carry significant cultural weight in the campaign world.<br/><br/>A similar thing I have seen in a tabletop RPG was in 7th Sea, where players were forced to designate which pseudo-European country their character came from, thereby forcing them to fit in, at some level, with the game's setting. And it impacted the character mechanically. The way the larps worked was extremely similar to that.<br/><br/>Another approach I've taken recently to avoid problematic dollhousing was this:<br/>We played in a game based on fairy tale stories. Every player was required to play a character from a known fairy tale story (though they would start with their story unfinished and the details of how it would play out would be determined in play). So everyone had an open dollhouse - if you weren't familiar with the particular story of the character chosen you could look it up and read it. And by explicit group agreement, the story your character came from was subject to change in play. It was tons of fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_384000">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/slliska" title="slliska"><img alt="slliska" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/631/nGS1XYKEZ7DB8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/slliska">slliska</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384000/#Comment_384000" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-30T18:02:18+00:00" title="June 30, 2012  6:02PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 30, 2012 7:11PM by slliska.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I started reading this thread because of the great term doll house.  I used to do this almost a decade ago, getting back into D&amp;D, after playing long ago as a kid.  Part of the reason was as Fuseboy mentioned above in <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a>, there was a lot of pressure; these people might have been my closest friends but they also considered themselves "serious role players" (which I have found to be a red flag).  These were traditional games; the GMs did expect us to discuss our characters with them ahead of time and work parts of our backstories into the world/campaign the GM designed.  I wanted to really know my character, be able to slowly reveil my character; just like you get to know a person in real life, be able react in ways to reflect her backstory and have ideas of what to say in certain situations.<br/><br/>Once I created a druid that was the last surviving member of her village and was in search of a cure for the lycanthropy hysteria disease that wiped out her village.  The back story was a couple of pages, but I did do everything I could think to interject parts of my story into playing the game; in the non linear way people really talk about their real life to friends.  However, the GM never did weave anything into the game about my back story, I even talked to him about it privately since he had given his okay on it.  He later said he didn't know how to work any of my details of it into the extensive story/world he had created.  Both the PCs and GM seemed to ignore anything I brought up in character regarding it, as well, focusing on their own agendas.  In reflection, I think all the people at the table doll housed to some degree, including the GM railroaded us on occasion.    <br/><br/>While playing a different character, I got into a lot of trouble with a player for restraining his character from killing a seeming innocent NPC (which was 100% of out of character for his LG character to do).  He had already been passing notes to the GM and he felt justified being sneaky.  I felt my character was doing what was reasonable, protecting the NPC and restraining the fellow PC when he was acting crazy, based on the information she had, but the player of that PC was really angry at me.  Many groups and 5 yrs of playing story games later, things are different and I haven't created more than a few lines of text on an index card in years for a character, usually with the other players having at least some input.  So I basically chalk doll housing up to being associated with traditional games and inexperienced players, as it has been rare for me to see it happen with story games; if for no other reason the mechanics usually discourage it. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_384010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384010/#Comment_384010" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-30T20:34:03+00:00" title="June 30, 2012  8:34PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In a way, what keeps ending up being described here is kind of a sweet or kind-hearted version of the Fundamental Attribution Error. <br/><br/>As long as a player keeps all this great stuff in his or her head, everyone in the group will, as is human nature, apply considerably worse attributes to the character for actions which seem totally justified - in the dollhouse they've never seen.<br/><br/>On the other hand - I really, really don't want to read someone else's dollhouse write-up.

In my old groups meta gaming was considered poor gaming, where as we use it all the time in story games (director stance) now days.  Many yrs ago, in sort of a passive aggressive move, the player I mention above, put his lowest roll (a 6) into Intelligence in the first game we ever played.  He spent the entire game as the most experienced player, telling the table of inexperienced players OOC that he had an idea (to get us out of this problem), but he couldn't share it as his character would have been too simple minded to come up with it.  This was a frustration for himself too, and he eventually sort of committed suicide by doing something stupidly rash, that seemed OOC for even his character.  My point is that even thought I try to assume the best intentions (not the worse attributes) when something happens I don't understand in or out of a game, I think table talk does help.  Rather than think we are serious "role players" having to follow rules on how to act, now days we always think of the game as a movie we are presenting to a pretend audience (like in PtA), so we work together to create an interesting story; sometimes sharing OOC knowledge.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_384031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384031/#Comment_384031" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-01T03:44:31+00:00" title="July  1, 2012  3:44AM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Players are ALL Mary Sue when it comes to their characters.

You create a character that's a power of something. They're epic! There's only one of you in creation! A very big part of character creation is what places your character is tied to, including Domain (power over your estate, essentially where your power resides) and Realm (power where your imperator boss person lives). The mechanics implied in these connections encourages players to really flesh out their personal spaces. If you have a great deal of power over where you live, the details about where you live are important. So you end up fleshing out these... little dollhouses for your character. Very reminiscent of the worlds Neil Gaiman creates for each of the powers in the Sandman series. <br/><br/>This is a very literal interpretation of Doll Houses. But maybe that's a way to lead into productive use of complicated and long character paraphernalia. <br/><br/>It also reminds me of the Dresden Files game. Another literal interpretation, but I think that Dresden (and fate game in general) take a known tendency for players to want to Doll House and intentionally spreads it out amongst the group. Think of City Creation. One big shared dollhouse, with lots of intricate pieces, players, themes, moods, settings. Each location in city creation is a room in the Doll House. Players have the ability to create what they want, and then play in it! Characters become a reflection of the city. I mean, I suppose character creation in Spirit of the Century encourages/discourages it simultaneously too, because you're doing a lot of writing on your character sheet, but you have to do a round robin and share it with everyone else.<br/><br/>In our recent Vampire: the Requiem game (another White Wolf example! I'm seeing a pattern here with "storytelling" games) Doll Housing happened SO MUCH. Individual character agendas were favored over group agendas, to reinforce a feel of genuine politicking. Emails happened in-between sessions that were "planning emails" so that each of us had complex plots none of the rest of us necessarily knew about. We would go around the table in session and have one on one scenes with the GM. I found it frustrating, because I wanted to get involved with the other players, but their stories and scenes were inaccessible. The only thing that tied us together as characters was a loosely contrived threat in the setting.<br/><br/>I think it's really easy to head down that path in a game... focus on individual character's stories and loosing how to tie all the threads together. I think actually that's what allows doll housing to happen. So... turning that into something fun might be the trick if you want it to be a positive thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_384112">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384112/#Comment_384112" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-02T10:10:17+00:00" title="July  2, 2012 10:10AM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I heard that Mary Sue lives in a doll house.</blockquote>\nThis is a good point to deal with. Doll housing, when used as a defense certainly makes a great Fortress of Solitude for Mary Sue. But that need not be the case. Some dollhouses have leaky roofs. And Mary Sue can fly free of any house, I am sure. The example of Fiasco is a good one for games that have expectations of vulnerability, dysfunction, limitations etc. for the characters. This can also be realized in the isolated fiction of a dollhouse depending on the players, the game, etc. We can't judge what's in there if we don't know!\n<blockquote>Players are ALL Mary Sue when it comes to their characters.

Shall we be specific about a Mary Sue and say that it is a character that had no limits or vulnerabilities? I feel pretty comfortable with players having characters that are idealized and empowered in some ways, and not calling them Mary Sue's per se, unless they are egregiously so. \n<blockquote>Some of the most interesting doll housing I've done was with games that started out with players finding themselves as UFO abductees, waking from cryogenics, or otherwise finding themselves trapped in a place where they had to communicate and work with others to try to find a way out from the beginning. </blockquote>\nAnother great application of this! Sounds like a lot of fun. Whenver there is a reason for more of the world to exist, and for others not to know it yet, that's a good place for a dollhouse.\n<blockquote>The back story was a couple of pages, but I did do everything I could think to interject parts of my story into playing the game; in the non linear way people really talk about their real life to friends. However, the GM never did weave anything into the game about my back story, I even talked to him about it privately since he had given his okay on it. He later said he didn't know how to work any of my details of it into the extensive story/world he had created. Both the PCs and GM seemed to ignore anything I brought up in character regarding it, as well, focusing on their own agendas.</blockquote>\nThis is another very important part of the dynamic: when an open, shared dollhouse is solicited by the GM and created by the player, but the rest of the group drops the ball on incorporating it into the game. This could be the perception, as well, of anyone who starts creating parts of the game world on their own--that its isolation is caused by the lack of receptivity of the other players.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_384147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384147/#Comment_384147" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-02T16:01:08+00:00" title="July  2, 2012  4:01PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK,<br/>  I did encounter this a little in Trad games. Typically, this behavior is less disruptive because most trad-style games do not interact too heavily with a character's back story (look at Keep on the Shadowlands).<br/>  But, I have encountered this in more Story Games, and it is hard to manage. We were playing PTA and one player had come up with an intricate back-story for their character. We made characters together, so it was not even an issue with pre-playing. They just got excited about their character and started filling in blanks.<br/>  At first, I thought it was kind of cool, but when one of their scenes came up and they decided to do a flashback, it all went pear-shaped. Specifically, no one was allowed to bring their character and when players offered to portray the NPCs needed for the scene, there was a lot of hesitation and anxiety and in the end, the Doll Houser was very disappointed. Before it started, I tried to warn them that there had to be at least part of the scene that was up for grabs, but the forged ahead anyways.<br/><br/>  In the end, this is not as big an issue as it could be. For Trad games, the backstory is not central and in most story games, the backstory is made on the fly.<br/>  When it does happen, its not too bad as long as the player has an open minds. Once you get to the "look, but don't touch" territory, it is problematic though.<br/>Dave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_384149">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Praion" title="Praion"><img alt="Praion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Praion">Praion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384149/#Comment_384149" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-02T16:24:55+00:00" title="July  2, 2012  4:24PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 2, 2012 4:29PM by Praion.">edited July 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In german discussion we call this kind of behaviour barbie playing.<br/><br/>Edit: Now that i think about it it's not exactly the same thing.

A barbie also get's played with when you are at home, away from the table. <br/>Might not be the same thing but it's related for sure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_385366">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385366/#Comment_385366" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-18T12:13:27+00:00" title="July 18, 2012 12:13PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ron's doing a "color first" thing, which seems in the vicinity of the dollhouse:<br/><a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/adept/index.php?topic=10.0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://indie-rpgs.com/adept/index.php?topic=10.0</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390877">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner" title="Evan_Torner"><img alt="Evan_Torner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/278/nHOYP3VNJB6A6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner">Evan_Torner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390877/#Comment_390877" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-20T05:55:30+00:00" title="September 20, 2012  5:55AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 20, 2012 6:46AM by Evan_Torner.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (post deleted to be reconceived)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_390879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390879/#Comment_390879" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-20T06:03:07+00:00" title="September 20, 2012  6:03AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 20, 2012 6:12AM by Graham.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>A <a href="http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/nonfiction/gulliver.htm" rel="nofollow">phatic</a> player is playing their character as wish-fulfillment.
