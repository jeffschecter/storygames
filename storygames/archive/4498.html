As we all know, Borgstrom is no friend of the accessible, but I seemed to be able to decipher the following (if you've read the book, feel free to correct me): The book's eponymous Fair Folk live in "The Wyld", a kind of primal chaos of the sort that tend to precede creations. This Wyld is amorphous and malleable, and within its borders, the Fair Folk have an almost unlimitied ability to affect their surroundings. To give structure to their otherwise structureless existence, they therefore partake in self-enforced narratives, where they assume objectives and play out event sequences, like some kind of existential theatre.<br/><br/>I found this very interesting, and started thinking more generally about this technique, wherein you play character's who, in turn, play characters. The narrative then becomes stratified, with a first order narrative and a second order narrative. While the first order narrative resembles any old narrative, there is different ways to relate to the second order narrative: you can look at it from 1) an objective viewpoint (is the narrative interesting in its own right?), 2) from the viewpoint of the first order narrative (what is the relationship between the narrative and the first order characters? What are their purpose with it, and what are they doing to meet this purpose?) or 3) from the viewpoint of the players (How do the second order narrative interact with the first order ditto to create the play experience as a whole?)<br/><br/>What might this technique be used for? One obvious answer is, to explore premises related to stories and how they work. This usage is most strongly related to perspective 3), above, since it summons forth meta-narrative considerations. Or you could use it to explore the psychological significance of stories (e.g. to create identities through "life stories"), at which you benefit by taking viewpoint 2), which forces you to consider how your (first order) character views and is affected by the narrative.<br/><br/>Are there more usages? What games are there that use the technique? And what are your experiences?<br/><br/>/Kalle                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101899/#Comment_101899" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T08:27:40+00:00" title="October  9, 2007  8:27AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>1001 Nights</i> is the first game that comes to mind.

It also allows you to make comments on one level of the game through the second and gives you motivations for your characterization based on envies and ambitions. <br/><br/>So from the viewpoint of the characters, their stories have a purpose and point. From the viewpoint of the players, they have many hooks on which to hang their tale, and are asked to think of it as a story, meant to entertain and engage, rather than to think just from a single character's point of view.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101908/#Comment_101908" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T08:50:31+00:00" title="October  9, 2007  8:50AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 9, 2007 8:50AM by Bill_White.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played a game of <i>1001 Nights</i> last year that was very interesting because of the way the different levels of narrative reflected ironically back at each other. Mendel and I played a lame cobbler and a wizened astrologer, respectively, enrolled into the story told by Megan's haughty courtesan about two young brothers who, imprisoned by a sultan, each fall in love with a maiden of the court whom they spy and attempt to win. At one level, there is the relationship between the brothers as they compete for the maiden. At another level, there is the ironic contrast with the two "actors" who, infirm by disability or age, play the roles of younger men (as well as the contrast between the storytelling courtesan and the innocent maiden of her story). And, at a third level, there is the way the layered fictions serve as metaphor for what's happening at the table, where Mendel and I are "competing" in front of Megan--whose character will she award the maiden's heart?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101931">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Calvino" title="Calvino"><img alt="Calvino" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Calvino">Calvino</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101931/#Comment_101931" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T09:45:23+00:00" title="October  9, 2007  9:45AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan: What is your reason for including the technique in your game?<br/><br/>Emily: Interesting.

It allows the (first order) characters to make comments on the events in their world as they percieve it and, at the same time, for the players to make comments about the first order narrative through the second-order narrative.

One description of the game's premise is:\n<ul><br/>A mythopoetic, totemistic cross between JurisFiction and The Matrix, in which you play post-modern punked-out Gaiman-esque personae from classical literature or legends (Scheherazade, the Monkey King, Quetzalcoatl, Don Quixote, Coyote) who hack their way through stories, taking on various roles and playing out bits and pieces of hundreds of different tales, all in an effort to collect various character traits and personality components from the characters whose roles they usurp, constantly reconfiguring themselves in an effort to become the person they most want to be.<br/></ul>\nLater on, I made it more karmic, with the characters working off a debt to the Folkways by working through the various masks (character roles) that they had accumulated until they resolved all of them:\n<ul><br/>As a trickster, a shinchanger, or a storyteller, each member of an indebted masker troupe begins play with a countless number of masks. The masks a trickster wears on his or her body are like an enormous suit of armor, heavy, cumbersome, and obscuring any identifiable features. Additional masks must be carried on one\xe2\u20ac\u2122s back in a huge Santa Claus sack. These countless masks are the debt the trickster owes to the Folkways, the weight that holds them in the cycle, unable to find release.<br/><br/>In order to repay their debt to the Folkways and escape the endless wheel, a trickster must let go of all their masks and leave them behind. Once they have done this, they Transcend to another realm. You let go of a mask by fulfilling certain conditions required by the Key [stolen from The Shadow of Yesterday] at the mask\xe2\u20ac\u2122s core. These conditions are called the Buyoff. Masks that are bought off are not simply removed and placed in your sack (as usual), they are reabsorbed into the folkways and can never be used again.<br/></ul>\nDoes that make sense?  Part of it is definitely about the various levels of narrative having parallel or contrasting elements that comment on each other, like the separate Fraggle and human narratives in <i>Fraggle Rock</i> <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101951">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101951/#Comment_101951" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T10:30:23+00:00" title="October  9, 2007 10:30AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 9, 2007 10:30AM by Emily_Care.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Calvino</cite>Emily: Interesting.

Bill's post is a great illustration of the other aspects of it in the game, and how they help you come up with strong narrative elements. <br/><br/>In another game I'm working on now, people play two sets of characters who have radically different information given to them about what is happening in the game. One set will be given more information about the other, and the instructions to incorporate that information into stories they tell about their experiences, making the other person question their own sense of what is true.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101955/#Comment_101955" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T10:36:01+00:00" title="October  9, 2007 10:36AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Note: I also see it as a way of linking a bunch of diverse play together through a meta-narrative.
