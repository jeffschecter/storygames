Some very conservative evangelical friends of the family (I was in high school) were visiting. Over dinner, they proceeded to talk about how "Pokemon is created by the same people who make Dungeons &amp; Dragons--don't you see how these cute creatures are a sugar-coated face to something corrupt that's tricking kids into evil?" And of course we nod, because my family is non-confrontational to a ridiculous degree, my mom probably kind of agrees and/or cannot bring herself to vocally disagree without becoming physically sick, my dad probably doesn't really care.<br/><br/>They leave, I pull out my Gameboy Color and boot up my Pokemon cartridge. I tell my parents exactly how their misinformation got spread (WOTC owns D&amp;D and the Pokemon card game, the "creators" are different people, etc.). "That's all well &amp; good", my mom says, "but don't bring it up around them." And that was where I learned what kind of adult I wanted to be, doing what I wanted to do and not giving a shit or hiding it.

Magic is supernatural power that does not come from God.<br/>2. Therefore, magic is a sin - it denies the supremacy of God by invoking other forces to control the world around you (some sects believe that all magic derives from Satanic forces, others simply believe it's a form of 'cheating').<br/>3. Sinning in thought is as bad as sinning in deed as far as your immortal soul is concerned.<br/>4. Therefore, pretending to be a wizard (or use magic) is as bad as actually being a wizard or using magic.<br/>5. Since it's pretty much impossible to play D&amp;D without using magic, D&amp;D is right out.<br/><br/>Some of the evangelical Christians I've talked to on this issue were pretty much okay with the idea of, say, an historically accurate medieval RPG as long as the players were not expected to use or endorse the use of magic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_393998">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393998/#Comment_393998" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-19T16:31:47+00:00" title="October 19, 2012  4:31PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Daniel,<br/><br/>Very true!

One would expect that sinning "in thought" involved misdirected wishful thinking and idle personal speculation over a sinful subject matter. If mere symbolic acts within arbitrary notional frameworks count regardless of the psychological states involved, then I guess playing Monopoly is avarice, planning military operations is unjust war and a judo bout is murder. And dating is licentiousness, of course, but we all probably already knew that one.<br/><br/>I'm also intrigued by the concept of supernatural power; apparently there's some manner of naturalist worldview going on here, enabling a person to divide actions and phenomena into natural and supernatural ones. This is quite a feat in my mind, as I can't conceive of how to go about this task of distinguishing the two without exhaustive understanding of either realm. An epistemological problem, you understand.<br/><br/>Not that I expect much in the way of consistency when this caliber of subject matter is on the table, of course.

I don't really understand how stuff works for Baptists, but for Calvinists, the thinking goes something a little more like this.<br/><br/>Demons exist, but only vicariously, through our sins and limitations. This is true whether you call them "demons" or "gods" or what have you. The more interest you take in them, the more credence you lend them, and the realer they get for you (especially if you worship them as false gods). Once you give them an identity, they're like a vampire you've invited in the door. Even if it's "just a game", you're still talking about them and conferring a semblance of being to them. This is especially true when the premise of the game is that you identify with a fictional character in a fantasy world in which pagan gods and demons are (fictionally) "real".<br/><br/>Fictional reality is a gateway existence, which a demon will exploit in order to blur the difference between game and reality. The (fictional) existence of magic serves to make the fictional world more desirable than the real world, and serves as a temptation to treat the fiction as realer than reality. This is especially amenable to the demonic agenda when they are the source of magic (either as demons, or as "spirits" and "gods") in the fiction. Fantasy role playing is akin to idolatry.<br/><br/>That's why the idea of drugged out college kids murdering each other in the sewers is so plausible for some Protestants. Obviously it doesn't start that way; these things never do. But once you start in that direction, there are forces at work that will be very happy to conduct you subtly and gently down that garden path.<br/><br/>Of course, I don't believe any of this or condone it. I do find it a fascinating and affine way of looking at the world. It isn't about imaginary friends in the sky; it's about imaginary nameless, formless, unnumbered dangers lurking in every shadow.<br/><br/>(Caveat: I'm not a theologian and not an expert on this stuff.

Interestingly enough it's symmetrical, God works the same way - he only has influence and reality insofar as you treat him that way.<br/><br/>This also goes for the idea that the existence of magic in a fantasy world makes it more desirable. I understand that this explains much about religious sentiment, for many it's just a preferable way to understand the world. <i>Dragonraid Adventure Learning System</i> agrees: by immersing players into a game world where faith in God is a virtue, players are acclimated to accept God into their lives in the reality as well. So if a game can make you susceptible to demons, it can do so for God as well.<br/><br/>Makes sense as a basic sort of propaganda strategy to me (not necessarily true, but credible on the surface), so if you're in a war of ideas (one-sided as that war may be), then rock on. Were I a Christian soldier I would be very careful to judge whether there actually exists an opposition that constructs devilish delights, though, as merely imagining such would make for a huge misinvestment of resources. Just imagine if all this anti-rpg brouhaha were instead directed towards creating Christianity-positive rpgs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
