There were a lot of good ideas in that game, marred by poor editing, lack of sales/marketing, and a system that was easy to break, especially when you factored in the Soul abilities and the merits/flaws system. <br/><br/>Since odds are good that you don't have this game, let me give you the basics. There are two Almighties in this setting: one is God as most people know It, and the other is the Gnostic Demiurge. One champions the Ideal, the other is the champion of Earth and all its flaws and beauties. The Demiurge is supposedly the weaker of the two, a pale and twisted copy, but as far as the PCs were concerned, they were both infinite enough to not split hairs. <br/><br/>They're playing out the Apocalypse, because the Demiurge killed the Last Savior who was supposed to shepherd the faithful into the Heavens, and then the shutting down of the world would commence. (She was a teenage Bosnian Muslim girl, killed in Bosanski Samac in 1992.) Since then, anyone who was sired by God (Ahura Mazda) or the Demiurge (Ahriman) has been awakened and given the ability to cross over into the Heavens or the Hells, as well as being able to perform miracles. It's the Last Exodus, where either the faithful get to cross over into Eden, and Earth gets sealed off forever, or the forces of the Demiurge raid Eden, stripmine it for its powers and resources, and send it crashing down to Earth. <br/><br/>Although the game was designed with the PCs being agents of Ahura Mazda, you didn't have to be. The differences were in the types of miracles you could perform. If you were from Ahura Mazda's side, you could only make a miracle that helped people, or was otherwise a "good" miracle. If you were Ahriman's child, you could only use a miracle that harmed people, or was in some way "evil." You earned Miracle Points in a fashion similar to Force Points from the d6 Star wars game. If you used a miracle in the opposite way from how you were supposed to, you ended up switching over to the other side. Your skill with certain categories of Miracles determined how far you could make that Miracle Point stretch. Also, you had to flip a card to determine if you successfully got the Miracle off. <br/><br/>Oh, yeah, the game was card-based instead of dice-based. Aces were one, Kings were Matrix-action territory, and the rest fell somewhere in between, and you compared them to the difficulty as set by the GM. (Rough guidelines were given.)  Suits corresponded to the four main attributes: Diamonds was Spiritual (easily the Most Important Attribute), Spades was for Mental, Clubs was for Physical, and Hearts was Cultural (social). If your card matched the attribute you were using for that action, you got a +1 bonus for your score vs. difficulty. If you got a King in your suit, you drew again and doubled the result of your next draw; if the King was your attribute suit, you won spectacularly. If you got a Joker, you drew again and halved the result, which most likely meant failure. There were the ever-present special rules for combat, and three different types of damage you could take, which kind of did the whole downward-spiral thing a la Shadowrun. <br/><br/>You had a Soul Form, which is what you looked like in heaven. There were different types of Souls, which had different types of Racial abilities, which you could unlock more of if you increased your Spiritual stat. Some of these could be game-breaking, some were neat but essentially fluff. Same with the Merits and Flaws, which had the interesting twist that any Flaws/Merits you took in your human form showed up as Merits/Flaws in your Soul form, which I thought was an interesting touch. Also, in your Soul Form, you distributed your Spiritual score amongst your other three attributes while in  Soul Form. Eden was supposed to be the over-the top, action-movie portion of the game, which mashed space-opera with fantasy with high drama. <br/><br/>Miracles were divided into six types: Benediction(which gave you power over fate, blessings and curses and fortunate coincidences), Deliverance (which allowed multiple people to cross over between Eden and earth, and even teleport around), Exorcism (which allowed you to control minds and souls; if you commanded it, they had to obey), Scripture (the power to create things, from inanimate objects to bodies to new souls), Smite ( you kill shit pyrotechnic style), and Stigmata (your blood allows you to control life, yours or others). The boundaries between the six could blur easily, and that may be a feature rather than a bug. You added Spiritual+Miracle type and added your card to see if you succeeded in making a miracle happen. Others could spend Miracle Points to counter yours, going through the same procedure. <br/><br/>In some cases, it worked spectacularly, in other cases, there were (I thought) needless rules and crunchy bits, overweighted merits and flaws and Soulform abilities, and a number of cases where the rules weren't clear. <br/><br/>I want to awesome-ify this game. I want to get rid of a lot of distracting stuff, and I want to expand the focus of this game. If anyone's interested in helping me with this, let me know. I'll start posting some ideas I had. (Sorry, gotta run. Real Life calls.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123916">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123916/#Comment_123916" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-02T07:48:12+00:00" title="February  2, 2008  7:48AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The game already has way too much awesomeness.

Vice-versa if you were Apostate and used a miracle for evil.

Will resists temptation, intoxication, torture, exhaustion, etc. <br/><br/>Convictions: Like Spiritual Attributes from Riddle of Steel. Allows for extra dice on rolls in certain situations. <br/><br/>Skill Packages: Instead of adding dice, they set the difficulty level. Packages are Physical/Combat, Academic/Investigation, Social/Artistic, Wealth/Connections. Miracles are their own difficulty (let's say 8). Let's say you set the package difficulties at 8, 7, 7, 6 or something. Lowest difficulty is your specialty. <br/><br/>There's a fifth attribute of sorts, that develops during play: Commandments. Each Commandment the PC has is like one of the ten Commandments, except these are the foundation for the religion the PC is founding, according to what he/she believes should be emphasized. Each PC must have one Commandment at the start of the game. The die pool for Miracle activation is Commandments + relevant Conviction(s). Each Commandment a PC has allows him to store up to that many Miracle Points. <br/><br/>Miracles in standard Last Exodus are divided into three categories: Rite (minor), Ritual (medium), Liturgy (epic). Each Miracle Point allows a Miracle equal to the points spent. Thus, 1 MP= Rite, 2 MP= Ritual, and 3 MP= Liturgy. Each player starts out with 1 Miracle point. Also, for each MP gained over the course of play, the character adds either one attribute die when in Soulform, or gets to develop a special ability that can only be used in Soulform. It takes quite a bit to get Miracle Points: I'm hoping to tie that in somehow with the Followers of a PC. Any advice would be great. Also: Miracles trump *everything* if they fire successfully. The only thing that beats a Miracle is a miracle of equal or greater MPs. <br/><br/>Note: do not take any action which violates your Commandments, or you lose a Miracle point. Or something. <br/><br/>On earth, your PC founds his religion, allied to either Ahura Mazda (God) or Ahriman (Demiurge). I'd like to keep the good/evil dichotomy, unless you think that Commandments are enough of a stricture to wave that away. I hope so. <br/>In Eden/The Hells, your character goes on epic adventures of the Star Wars variety for your side. The end goal is the same: get your chosen people over to Eden safely, or lead them to storm the gates of heaven. <br/><br/>Any advice? Particularly on health levels, or their equivalent?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy" title="spookyfanboy"><img alt="spookyfanboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/150/384869271_f51cf8bf05.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy">spookyfanboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125003/#Comment_125003" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-07T14:18:07+00:00" title="February  7, 2008  2:18PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Or, here's a question: do I really give a damn about Eden or any of the Otherworlds?

I want to focus on building the religion, and keeping a bit of a handle on Miracles. Soulforms...right now I'm wondering if I shouldn't just skip that, or keep it because Eden is a great place to whip out the awesome, special effects battles, emphasizing how earth is where you go to deal with the day-to-day struggles.
