Hoping you're all having a nice Christmas. It's over on this side of the globe, and a good time was had by all.<br/><br/>So it's not exactly game design, but more of a derivative idea? game device? fan creation? I guess it's design in a broad sense, and couldn't find any category more fitting.<br/><br/>So, as the title says, it's about an IAWA oracle built on tarot cards, and is not for a specific setting. You can choose or make up a setting after drawing the cards. For instance I've just started setting up an irregular game with this oracle, and after we drew the four cards we decided on a setting inspired by ancient China. The original vision when I set out with the oracle was something like a fantasy Renaissance Italy, but I've since decided to divorce the oracle from a specific setting. The originally envisioned atmosphere may still leak through, though. (Lots of war, lots of intrigue and sex and murder etc. Of course that could just be the tarot itself, which first appeared in currently recognizable form in Renaissance Italy.)<br/><br/>The untested alpha version (translated from the original Korean) is <a href="http://wiki.storygames.kr/iawa/tarot_oracle_en" rel="nofollow">on my wiki</a>, so any comments or feedback is most welcome. After some debugging I could maybe put it up somewhere like <a>Abulafia</a>, though I think the full chart has value, too: Players who read tarot could actually use the oracle as a spread, limit the suites to use (maybe Major, Cups, and Wands only, for instance, for a romance-intrigue drama with a higher chance for a Major Arcana card), read reverse cards differently, and so on.<br/><br/>Specific questions I'm particularly interested in, though the list is by no means exhaustive:<br/><br/>- Are the Major Arcana oracles too literal, that is too centered on the traditional tarot images to give story direction? Should they be more  "sublimated" or interpreted, like most of the Minor Arcana cards and the current versions of The Empress or The Lovers?<br/><br/>- Are the oracles too gendered and therefore restrictive? (Should I have, for instance, less "kings" and more "monarchs" or even "leaders?") On the flip side, should they be more gendered to provide clearer archetypes and story direction? I've tried to avoid gendering with most of the Minor Arcana cards, though you can see how I had to play Twister with the English language to do so, like some of the original oracle cards--only worse. Your language needs a non-gendered singular pronoun, like, three centuries ago.<br/><br/>- Does the setting independence work, or does it only serve to water down the flavor of the oracle? I don't think it's truly universal, since it's more suited to pseudo-historical fantasy drama than anything else. As long as those restrictions are evident, maybe I should just go all out for the medieval/Renaissance Europe feel. Or conversely, maybe I could make it truly universal by taking out references to forests, towers, etc., but I'm rather skeptical of that working out.<br/><br/>- Do the randomly drawn cards link up well enough together to form a coherent direction? What makes for a good oracle anyway, and where could mine be improved? Do any specific unhelpful cards jump out at you?<br/><br/>- If I upload the full oracle somewhere, any suggestions where to put it? I don't think my predominantly Korean personal wiki is the best place for English users to find it, though maybe I could link it from elsewhere.<br/><br/>Any look-throughs, comments, and advice would be much appreciated.
