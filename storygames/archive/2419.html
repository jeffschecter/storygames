                    So, this is the game I grew up playing. Back then, it used to be called Golden Heroes. Now, one of the original authors has reclaimed it and called it <a href="http://www.squadronuk.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">Squadron UK</a>. I think that makes it a British indie game.<br/><br/>Man, this is so old school. You roll for your superpowers! In fact, you roll eight times, once for each superpower. And then you come up with a backstory that fits them all together. The randomised stuff seems odd at first, but it's great for getting you out of any preconcieved character notions, and it's a hell of a lot of fun.<br/><br/>And then the combat system. Overcomplicated but cool. I particularly like the Push Back Threshold: if someone takes too much damage, they go flying back, and then they crash through a wall, and then they fly back some more. Brilliant. And Hits To Coma and Hits To Kill: you can try to knock someone out rather than kill them but, sometimes, you kill them accidentally. Occupational hazard.<br/><br/>And huge amounts of rules on public status: you can have the backing of the government but the public hates you. <br/><br/>Anyway, it's great, and there's a free starter PDF, which I recommend. I'll run it at Concrete Cow, in Milton Keynes, in March. There's also an <a href="http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/12/12248.phtml" rel="nofollow">RPG.Net review</a> which goes into much more detail.<br/><br/>Graham                </div>

                            I played GH once at Uni. I seem to remember I was a green skinned, duplicating, regenerating, immortal with time control. At the time the group was really frustrated with the total arbitrariness of it all. Possibly that was because the GM wanted us all to justify our powers to the n-th degree of detail.                        </div>

                            It's interesting: it seems to me that super-rpg fans fall into two camps. Those that are completely cool with randomly rolled powers (seeing the odd results they produce as catalysts for creativity perhaps?), and those that far prefer to build what they want to build. I know several folks who really favour V&amp;V and Golden Heroes, in part because of their "rules lightness" and in part because they seem to "capture well the flavour of the comics". I also know lots of folks who scorn these games and far prefer HERO, Godlike/WT, GURPS Powers, and other "build 'em from the ground up" types of games.<br/><br/>One thing that always impressed me about Golden Heroes was the richness of rules it had for managing the PC's standing within the campaign world: this was far more important in the game than in any other contemporary game (which, as far as I could tell, where little more than combat engines with a character creation engine attached). These days, I suspect that the "reputation and resources" rules could be done more elegantly, but at the time I thought they were very interesting indeed.<br/><br/>I still have my copy of the two original books, tattered and taped together, but the box has long since vanished.<br/><br/>The whole "make five random rolls" thing never bothered me much - heck, if you didn't want random, you could just say roll five times, or roll twice and pick three, or pick five, or whatever. But I suspect that it would be safe to have everyone in the campaign use one method - picking powers in GH could lead to much stronger characters than rolling randomly, as there were several "combos" of powers that were quite powerful and the chances of getting these combos randomly would be very low.                        </div>

                            The random powers can be a bit much. They make more sense if you roll two or three times and then upgrade those powers instead of rolling again. That way, you have a few focussed powers, not a rag-tag collection.<br/><br/>But I think the character regeneration works best with a bit of drift: roll the first few powers randomly, after which the GM starts saying "Weather Control? That doesn't fit. Roll again."<br/><br/>Viktor, yes, I liked the reputation and resources stuff too.<br/><br/>Oh, yes, and it has a Pushing, Lifting and Tearing Apart table! How can you not love a game that has that?<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            I really don't enjoy having randomly created characters.  We tried playing GH in te 80s and didn't like it much.  Went back to champions pretty fast IIRC.<br/><br/>Maybe I ought to have another look if I can remember where my set went...                        </div>
