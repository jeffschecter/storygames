We purposefully broke the game to fit it into the Film Noir theme.</b><br/><br/>Since there were only three of us, we decided to run it GM-full.  So first I read out the oracles that I had brought with me, based on <a href="http://www.random-generator.com/index.php?title=Noir_Oracle_-_Down_These_Mean_Streets" rel="nofollow">these</a>.<br/><br/><i>A greedy woman who walked out on her lower-class husband to claw her way to the top.<br/><br/>A dirty cop, caught red-handed by his rookie partner.<br/><br/>A taxi driver who stops for coffee and pie every night at 11.<br/><br/>A hotel dick, willing to look the other way for a bribe.</i><br/><br/>For a background, we decided to eschew the usual Los Angeles.  Instead, we brought the story up to the mountains in Colorado, circa 1949.  <i>Sunset</i>, a former mining town on a lake, now trying to make a run for being a resort.  A small place with one hotel and lots of vacation cabins.<br/><br/>Next we went through the oracles again and pulled out all the possible characters.  We ended up with ten, which seemed pretty heavy for three players to run.  So we spent a few minutes to combine a few of them and ended up with seven characters that were much tighter.  We also drew cards for an adjective (i.e. homicidal) to describe each character.  The content and character names came from content I had created for The Naked City.<br/><br/>I ran <i>Florence Peterson, a greedy diner waitress who wants to setup Carl and get him killed, and wants to steal Roy's taxi to get out of town.  Her Particular Strength is Passionate Kiss; Consequential Strength, works Covertly and Self-Protection; works directly against With Love and Self-Protection.</i><br/><br/>Robert ran <i>Carl Anderson, an on-the-run front desk clerk who is married to Florence.  He wants to keep a hold of his wife, and wants out from under Roy's thumb.  His Particular Strength is Predicting the Odds; Unique Strength; works Covertly and Maneuvering.</i><br/><br/>Chris P. ran <i>Roy Delgrand, a notorious taxi driver who wants to use Carl's brain for gain, and wants to shame that "floozy" Florence.  His Particular Strength is his taxi; Far-reaching Strength; Works Directly and Action.</i><br/><br/>NPCs were:<br/><br/><i>Billy Brooks, a homicidal hotel dick/dirty cop who wants to pimp Florence and bust Carl.  His Particular Strength is "the Benjamins".<br/><br/>Vernon Horne, a jealous bellhop who wants to possess Florence and cut Carl out.  His Particular Strength is his skeleton key that allows him to get in anywhere.<br/><br/>Clifford Fendley, an embittered rookie cop who wants to get Carl to testify against Billy.  His Particular Strength is his cop shield.<br/><br/>Glenn Eddleman, a ruthless diner cook, who wants to make sure that Florence stays at the diner, and wants Roy under his thumb.  His Particular Strength is his ability to eavesdrop on conversations.</i>.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150315">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150315/#Comment_150315" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T23:46:30+00:00" title="June 12, 2008 11:46PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>(Continued)</b><br/><br/>Now I mentioned that we purposefully broke the rules of the game.  There is a specific rule on page 12 that says "Don't roll the dice when two characters are having a conversation, no matter how heated it becomes; wait until one of the other <i>acts</i>."  We talked about it, and felt like Film Noir action tended to be quite a bit more subtle than the average fantasy yarn.  So we were okay with conflicts that were still about talking.<br/><br/>We played a short session, and actually took a lot of time creating these characters, so we only had time for four scenes:<br/><br/><i>1. Florence is serving the taxi driver Roy at the Sunset Cafe, when she notices a wealthy-looking man outside looking for a ride.  She smells money and tries to convince Roy to take the both of them to the hotel after her shift.  Roy doesn't want any part of her and just wants to get the rich guy as a fare to get the nice tip.  Florence wins and I narrate her taking off her apron and walking outside to take moneybags by the arm and walk him to Roy's cab.<br/><br/>2. While the cab is pulling up to the hotel, the setting sun shines into the lobby.  Just inside, Clifford the rookie cop is trying to convince Carl the desk clerk to visit the D.A. and hopefully testify against Clifford's former partner, who is now the hotel dick.  Robert wins the conflict and says, "Listen, I'm not going to make your case for you.  Come back when you actually have the goods on Billy.<br/><br/>3. After Clifford leaves and the folks in the cab are still outside, the bellhop sees the coast is clear and waves Billy in, who proceeds to browbeat Carl about "giving him up to the cops".  This was a great scene because Billy wanted to beat up Carl.  And Robert (playing Carl) decided that he wanted Billy to snap and beat Carl very badly.  Chris P. won the conflict, and Billy just slapped him around enough to intimidate him before straightening Carl's shirt and walking off.<br/><br/>4. Just then, the group from the cab walks into the hotel lobby.  Florence sees Billy and pulls him into a quiet alcove and is getting all romantic with him.  She wants Billy to kill Carl for her, and even hands him over a knife to do the job.  But Billy only sees dollar signs, and wants to pimp Florence out to the rich guy to make a nice bit of cash.  We have a tough conflict, but in the end Billy wins, and Florence lowers her head and agrees to take the rich guy upstairs.</i><br/><br/><b>Thoughts on running IAWA with Film Noir content</b><br/><br/>I came into this game thinking that the most difficult part of character generation would be Particular Strengths, since we weren't doing fantasy or magic.  But we all came up with some cool strength relatively quickly, and many of them got used in play.  For example, it make total sense that Florence got to use her passionate kiss as I was playing her as a greedy femme fatale.<br/><br/>Our biggest challenge was coming up with Best Interests.  I think there were several reasons for this.  First, we were each creating a PC and either one or two NPCs, which was a lot to coordinate.  Robert eventually drew up a quick R-map to keep the connections solid.  Also, while I picked Florence who ended up being the center of a lot of attention, Robert and Chris P. (by their own admission) picked two of the boring characters to play as PCs.  So we ended up breathing a little too much life into the NPCs and didn't say enough awesome for the PCs.  Also, the PCs were complex, but diluted as well.  Whereas the NPCs were simplistic, but very focused.<br/><br/>The negotiation at the end of conflicts was still a bit unclear for us, but I think that would get better with more play.<br/><br/>Personally, I had quite a lot of fun finally playing some Film Noir content.  I think if we had more time, we could work our way into the story more and try to finish a chapter.  But since Film Noir stories tend to use the same set of characters, I'm not sure how it would transfer moving to a second chapter that perhaps only contains a few characters from the preceeding chapter.<br/><br/>Thoughts?  Questions?  I'd also like to hear from Chris P. and Robert about their experiences with the Noir theme.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150375">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DainXB" title="DainXB"><img alt="DainXB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DainXB">DainXB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150375/#Comment_150375" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T06:04:14+00:00" title="June 13, 2008  6:04AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Who wound up on the Owe List at the end of Chapter 1?  New characters are easy to work in -- if Florence returns, they come into the diner.  If Carl returns, they check into the hotel.  If Roy returns, they get into his cab.  <br/><br/>For example, I just ran the oracle, and got:  <br/><br/>A safe-cracker, who just can't seem to stay on the straight and narrow.<br/>Two escaped convicts hiding out in a house, terrorizing the family.<br/>A lipstick-edged cigarette, smoldering in a cheap tin ashtray.<br/><br/>The safe-cracker could be worked into any of the three hooks I mentioned.  The convicts could be doing their thing to a family on vacation staying in a hotel room, rather than at their home.  Or they could have gotten a ride from Roy, to the vacation cabin one of them used to use as a hide-out, now rented to an unsuspecting family...  <br/>The woman smoking the cigarette could be doing it in the diner -- and lord knows what she might be up to.  Maybe she's the safe-cracker, or the safe-cracker's estranged wife.  Maybe she's someone who knows about the convicts and what they're up to.  Maybe one of the convicts is also the safe-cracker, and it's all very tightly wrapped up...<br/><br/>--<br/>DainXB                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150379/#Comment_150379" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T06:15:17+00:00" title="June 13, 2008  6:15AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think both Carl and Roy were on the Owe list, but Flo had been using the big guns and hadn't made the list.<br/><br/>Briefly, one thing that we all noticed was that Florence, our only female character, was quickly becoming a femme fatale and axis of the action. I'm not sure what would have come of that, had we continued. <br/><br/>I also think that when we shot for each PC to have a best interest conflicting wiht both other PCs, that it became a little strained. It may have been yet another game that benefitted from some sort of Roachian CIrcle of Love'n'Hate.<br/><br/>The NPCs, OTOH, were easy to grab onto. They each had one thing they wanted ( best interest), and they either got closer to it, or were thwarted and immediately had to start considering how to re-approach the thing from a different angle.<br/><br/>[Side note: "The  Billy punches you and intimidates you/ No, he flies off the handle and _really_ beats Carl" was completely and totally stolen from one of Levi K's AP reports]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150563">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Peterson" title="Chris Peterson"><img alt="Chris Peterson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cpeterso.com/html/img/merman-confounded.200x200.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Peterson">Chris Peterson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150563/#Comment_150563" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T13:01:33+00:00" title="June 13, 2008  1:01PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 13, 2008 1:02PM by Chris Peterson.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>[Side note: "The  Billy punches you and intimidates you/ No, he flies off the handle and _really_ beats Carl" was completely and totally stolen from one of Levi K's AP reports]</blockquote>Yes, I liked that "upside down" conflict.

The existing rules don't work for people talking each other into things, but a new subsystem could.  <br/><br/>How about this?<br/><br/>When your character agrees to do something for another character, write it down, with both characters' names. <br/>a) If your character does it, scratch it out and write her name on the owe list.<br/>b) If your character conclusively declines to do it, scratch it out and write the other character's name on the owe list.<br/>c) If it somehow becomes moot without either (a) or (b), just scratch it out.<br/><br/>That'd probably work. Everybody'd be motivated to ask and agree, with (probably) a good balance between making good and ditching out. You don't have to use the dice to bully me into having my character agree to do something for yours, you're offering me something I want in return instead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150899/#Comment_150899" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-15T13:07:45+00:00" title="June 15, 2008  1:07PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lumpley</cite>The existing rules don't work for people talking each other into things</blockquote>\nWhy is that?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150902/#Comment_150902" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-15T13:21:26+00:00" title="June 15, 2008  1:21PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Do you mean, why did I design the rules so that they don't work for people talking each other into things?

The <i>character</i> or the <i>player</i> could break a promise, but that rules as written don't have any way to account for that.
