However I may stand up while GM'ing to allow more effortless speech and greater gestures when describing stuff, it is VERY rare that I leave my end of the table or have any physical contact with the players.<br/><br/>That said.  The group that I played Montsegur with was used to a more physical style of play (the same group LARP'ed the steam engines in the machine room in the Hand of Sorrow in Lady Blackbird, as a background for Snargle's and Kyle's sabotage (I have photos, and permission to put them online, might do that in an AP on that session later)).  They stayed in their seats most of the time, but got up and acted out the consolamentum scenes, and a few short sequences during the session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307603">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307603/#Comment_307603" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-10T01:58:38+00:00" title="January 10, 2011  1:58AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 10, 2011 2:06AM by Wilhelm.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also: Montsegur needs a 'disclaimer'/'advisory' or something like that.<br/><br/>We put an 18+ rating on the game* and made it clear that we took it seriously, and explained that the game could get very uncomfortable. Yet we had a player back out during one of the sessions.  I see that not as a failure of the player, but as a personal failure of me not being able to convey the strong themes involved in the game properly before the game.<br/><br/>-<br/><br/>Before playing next time I'll ask the players if anyone is uncomfortable with reading aloud in public. If so, they just pass the cross on to the next player. We caught one very dyslectic player, it was all in good humor but that is not the kind of discomfort I am looking for.  <br/><br/><br/>* We brought 9 games with us to the IGL, 8 were playable by everyone and 1 (Montsegur) was only offered to the minority of adult players at the con.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307604">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307604/#Comment_307604" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-10T02:03:51+00:00" title="January 10, 2011  2:03AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As for Montsegur 1244, I didn't use any special GM:ing tricks, no music, no props.
