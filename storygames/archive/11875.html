I've been having this weird confusion for years about the way my gaming group and I (we haven't gotten together in almost a year) have approached playing a character in a pen and paper game, and I think this is an important question:<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you have an expectation that you are finished authoring your player character at character creation, or not? Why or why not?<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd have to do some soul-searching to answer the question for myself, because I would certainly say 'no' right now, but maybe years ago, when our gaming group got together it was 'yes'.  I think some guys in the group would definitely answer 'yes' to this though, because some of them are always getting into situations with their characters where they make other players mad but then respond 'I'm sorry, it's what my character would do.'  So what I'd really like to learn is why anyone would do that.  Would it be because there is something desirable about, not authoring a story, but living inside a story that in some way authors itself?  And if this is the goal, is it even realistically possible? I'd love to hear peoples' experiences with this from any angle!<br/>\n<br/>\n-- John Mauney                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265197">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265197/#Comment_265197" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-02T12:23:11+00:00" title="April  2, 2010 12:23PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't have time to really respond right now, but I'm also very curious about this <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265211">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur" title="cwilbur"><img alt="cwilbur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">cwilbur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265211/#Comment_265211" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-02T13:09:35+00:00" title="April  2, 2010  1:09PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the pre-Forge days, there were online RPG communities that divided people into "develop in play" (or DIP) versus "develop at start" (DAS) players.  My expectation is that at the end of character creation, I'll know enough about the character to play him or her reasonably consistently, but that there will still be things that surprise me.  I find that the more I nail down about a character, the more likely I am to have gotten something wrong, something that doesn't work organically for me with the rest of what I know about the character.  If you force me to nail down too much, the character turns into a token, and I can't get inside his or her head.  This isn't something that kills a game for me, but it's something that's definitely not to my tastes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe issue of "I'm sorry, but it's what my character would do" to explain an asshole move -- I've been around too long to buy that.  I mean, if it fits the character and the situation, okay, but I've played with too many jerks who used the fact that they had chosen to play a jerk as an excuse for behaving like a jerk to other people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265242">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265242/#Comment_265242" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-02T15:40:37+00:00" title="April  2, 2010  3:40PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The real answer: it depends on the game at hand.<br/><br/>My personal more emotional answer: I like to know what the characters are "about" before play begins.  I like having a good idea of what kind of crisis the character is facing and what he hopes to accomplish from enduring it.  If that central issue ends up smashing head long into another player's character's central issue then that's fertile ground for great play.  That works best when the "aboutness" of a character is constantly up for review and revision based on moment-to-moment fictional considerations.<br/><br/>I want to clarify that point:  I think story is the outcome of emotionally charged characters in motion.  I don't think characters serve the story.  I'm definitely NOT talking about a player altering his character to "fit" the story.  So, if in play, a player suddenly has an emotional instinct that their character would draw his gun and shoot another PC he should do it.  That's great drama.  That IS story.  However, once that moment has passed he should reflect and re-evaluate.  Is the emotion satisfied?  If he succeeded what does that mean?  If he failed what does that mean?  If he keeps unthinkingly gunning for the PC or doesn't know when to quit once he's been beaten things get ugly fast.<br/><br/>This all assume the players are engaged in honest character play.  There are people who engage is socially abusive and manipulative behavior and then cover it with excuses about their character.  That has nothing really to do with honest character play, it has to do with establishing dominance and status among your peers.  It's amazing how easy it is to distinguish between the two when you're observing what's really going on at the table.<br/><br/>It also amazing how people don't seem to believe you, when you point it out to them. <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/><br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265244/#Comment_265244" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-02T16:29:39+00:00" title="April  2, 2010  4:29PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: cwilbur</cite>My expectation is that at the end of character creation, I'll know enough about the character to play him or her reasonably consistently, but that there will still be things that surprise me.

Many times I've thought that something would be awesome in play and then discovered that it wasn't, so now I tend to leave myself some wiggle room so that I can get out of that situation.  It's also easier to get a good back-and-forth dynamic between my character and the other PCs if I keep my options open during the first few sessions.<br/><br/>...which is another way of saying that there's always some part of my fun that's going to depend on what everyone else at the table is doing, and if I design a character without leaving myself room to adjust things to respond to that, I don't have as much fun.  Basically I want to go into the game with a good, solid character concept and a short list of things that I'm pretty sure I want to do with it:  any less than that and I don't have enough of a handle to get into the game, any more than that and I can't engage with what everyone else is doing as easily.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
