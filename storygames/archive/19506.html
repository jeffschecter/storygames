That's a few months ago, and I got pretty occupied with coordinating Game Chef Korea, but yesterday I had the free time and attention to finally scratch that itch. This is still very much a work-in-progress, but I figured I might as well ask for outside perspective here.<br/><br/>Here are the modifications that I've made for The Quiet Days:<br/><br/><b>Background -</b><br/>The Quiet Days is a character-centric hack of The Quiet Year by Avery Alder Mcdaldno, taking place in a high school somewhere. Could be Korean, Japanese, American, or anywhere. Inspiration came from all of the above. Its focus is its graduating class, who have just finished their college entrance process and are spending the last four weeks as high school students, and the faculty of the school to a lesser degree.<br/><br/>The Quiet Days is meant to elaborate a typical school drama. Tropes fly everywhere. It's the players' job to make them unique.<br/><br/><b>Journal -</b><br/>Instead of using a map like The Quiet Year, this hack uses a journal. The journal is mostly text, with perhaps doodles or symbols. Whenever a player is telling an exciting story inspired by the card, another player jots down a one- or two-sentence summary for the time period. The finished journal could be rewritten into some novelized form or typed up as an actual play.<br/><br/><b>Cards and Time -</b><br/>The 52 playing cards are used to symbolize the last four weeks of high school. A week is broken down into 14 time periods - a Morning and an Afternoon for each day. When a card is drawn, see if the current time period is Morning or Afternoon. If it's Morning, you can respond to the card's Morning prompt. If it's Afternoon, the same with Afternoon prompt. Or you can use the Alternative, which is time-neutral.<br/><br/>The week starts on Tuesday Morning. The Afternoon of the fifth day is Sunday Afternoon, during which the players do not draw a card. Instead, conspire together to fill in the blanks in the current story. Or come up with a tangential story that puts a different light on on-going storyline or characters. The player who has the turn on Sunday Afternoon has the most say in the matter.<br/><br/>Therefore each suit represents a week. The first week is for establishing characters. The second week is for planting plot seeds. The third week is for wreaking havoc. The fourth week is for concluding the story. As The Quiet Days is now, the prompts may be a little forceful in encouraging the story direction. This is to be modified through playtesting.<br/><br/><b>Actions -</b><br/>The Quiet Days uses a different set of actions.<br/><br/><i>Introduce a Character</i> - As an action, the player can declare that someone new is showing up in the story and say "Let me introduce (name)", followed by a one-phrase description. That character now exists in the story and can be invoked by any player. This action can be used to fill in character-related plot holes.<br/><br/><i>There is a Rumor</i> - This action is very similar to Discover Something New, but instead of discovering a map feature, it introduces an event, situation or happening to the story world. This is used to fill in situation-related plot holes.<br/><br/><i>Hold a Discussion</i> - This action is largely intact, but with a minor difference - the players can borrow the perspective of in-game characters. But it is never "My character is/will" but rather "This character may/would". Like The Quiet Year, nobody really owns any of the characters. They are public property.<br/><br/>Start a Project and Discover Something New are discarded. Therefore project dice are unused.<br/><br/><b>Daily Events -</b><br/>What the cards say can be found here - <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nb0Q1fqM2FPFlSmwIsBRQKQhJcPJUfJcZ08LRp906Rc/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nb0Q1fqM2FPFlSmwIsBRQKQhJcPJUfJcZ08LRp906Rc/edit?usp=sharing</a><br/><br/>This is the most WIP part of this hack. I want to do more game-related things, such as discarding more cards and enforcing more actions, or either remove them altogether. Right now, it's a little unsure in the direction. I will have to playtest to see where to put them (or whether to remove them).<br/><br/>----<br/><br/>So that's the hack so far. What I need to take care of now is how I will handle contempt tokens. I think they could be used as is right now, but the perspective may need to be adjusted. Furthermore, the daily events need to be tweaked as well. The Third Week may be too apocalyptic.<br/><br/>Anyways, please let me know your thoughts. I put together the whole thing in 5 hours' time, so it's very rough around the edges. Also, if a hack of this scale is problematic, I'll remove this post!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433818">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/szp" title="szp"><img alt="szp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/191/n7DTE2GEA3S70.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/szp">szp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433818/#Comment_433818" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-14T07:49:22+00:00" title="June 14, 2014  7:49AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Any feedback would be appreciated!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433820">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scrape" title="Scrape"><img alt="Scrape" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/791/nYVCU4CTTPHBF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scrape">Scrape</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433820/#Comment_433820" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-14T08:33:12+00:00" title="June 14, 2014  8:33AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 14, 2014 8:34AM by Scrape.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I find that the map-making aspect of TQY is not only very satisfying and fun, it's also something public and available for everyone to reference and revise. A journal just doesn't seem to have the same impact, to me. Only one person can hold it at a time rather than being front-and-center on the table, and that pulls it out of the common space and common focus. The journal becomes an <i>object you share</i> whereas the map is a <i>shared object</i>. <br/><br/>During our TQY games, people are always doodling on the map, even during off turns: filling in trees in the DarkWood or adding waves to the ocean and stuff like that. It creates a sense of ownership <i>in each player</i> and that really makes it <i>personal </i>when someone changes the map. <br/><br/>So is there any reason you can't represent the school and its surrounding town in map form? Or come up with a way to share a piece of paper in the middle where visuals are more important than summaries? Because it's that visual history that really drives the play in my experience, and leaves an artifact behind that is more interesting than a play summary: a finished TQY map is like a puzzle instead of an explanation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433821">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Coalhada" title="Coalhada"><img alt="Coalhada" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Coalhada">Coalhada</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433821/#Comment_433821" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-14T09:48:48+00:00" title="June 14, 2014  9:48AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Something like the map from <i>Mean Girls</i>, perhaps?<br/><br/><span class="VideoWrap"><span class="Video YouTube" data-youtube="youtube-gZ_qXmxdgGM?autoplay=1"><span class="VideoPreview"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZ_qXmxdgGM"><img border="0" height="385" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/gZ_qXmxdgGM/0.jpg" width="640"/></a></span><span class="VideoPlayer"></span></span></span><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433828/#Comment_433828" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-14T14:27:56+00:00" title="June 14, 2014  2:27PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/>So, what is the analogue to the Frost Shepherds? What is the threatening thing on the horizon against which all the students' work will be in vain? Graduation? Adulthood? Or is that dynamic simply not present?<br/><br/>For me, removing projects is dangerously close to gutting the game, from a mechanical/ethical point of view. Why not retain projects? Why not have students 'Make a plan'? Things like 'apply to first-choice colleges' or 'organize a really great graduation dance' or 'thank our favourite teachers' seem quite appropriate, especially if you expand the time frame a bit.<br/><br/>I guess it depends what 'high school tropes' it is you are looking for here. It can't just be all of them, because the setting/premise is 'the last days of high school' -- so certain kinds of gossipy melodrama are not going to be appropriate, while other kinds of wistful melodrama are. <br/><br/>But really I think it's important to consider the basic dynamic of the original game, where a group struggles to be constructive in the face of obstacles both immediate and inevitable. If there is no way for the group to be constructive (projects), the whole game changes tone dramatically. Which is fine, if that's the goal, but then I think you have a gap in the gameplay and I am not sure what is meant to fill it. Are there just way more discussions? Way more rumours? In my experience with the Quiet Year, anywhere from half to two-thirds of the play is focused around projects; are you imagining that rumours (as a way of narrating events in the school) will take over this primary space, or something else?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433829">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433829/#Comment_433829" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-14T14:34:00+00:00" title="June 14, 2014  2:34PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/>Note that I don't mean that the students have to be making super constructive plans and like, building things -- I just think that they have to be <i>wanting</i> things, and pursuing what they want, and seeing what comes of those things and realizing that there is just no time to do all the things they want to do (because Frost Shepherds/graduation.)

But that doesn't negate Projects, not at all!<br/><br/>What about "The Football Team begins training to defeat their rivals for the last big game," "The Computer Club starts an elaborate scheme to crash the school's database before final grades come out," "The Theatre Club plans their farewell performance" "The Prom Committee is planning the biggest prom bash ever"? These are all legit projects that this game could see. Will they succeed or fail?<br/><br/>Where this falls apart is that Graduation Day is a known date, not an unpredictable event based on a card you draw. All the students know exactly what day this will be. What if instead we watched a school that was about to be de-funded and shut down unexpectedly?

I had discarded the visual aspect because I wanted to place the main focus on the characters, who may be a little hard for a lot of people to draw.\n<blockquote>So, what is the analogue to the Frost Shepherds?

The beginning of something radically different.\n<blockquote>For me, removing projects is dangerously close to gutting the game, from a mechanical/ethical point of view.</blockquote>\nThe intention was that Start a Project would be replaced by Introduce a Character. I think this is an important distinction because I had (previously) placed the focus on <i>who the students are</i> rather than <i>what the students do</i>. Furthermore, 28 days seemed rather short for a lot of project ideas that I had (though this thread is full of better ideas right now).\n<blockquote>In my experience with the Quiet Year, anywhere from half to two-thirds of the play is focused around projects; are you imagining that rumours (as a way of narrating events in the school) will take over this primary space, or something else?</blockquote>\nThat is my experience as well. Start a Project's replacement - Introduce a Character - would fulfill the void, or it should have. I wanted a story out of this hack to be character-centric. Full of colorful and strange people. Like those we remember when we think back on high school.\n<blockquote>Where this falls apart is that Graduation Day is a known date, not an unpredictable event based on a card you draw.

Would probably model the original TQY experience more closely. It would tell a very different story, though, than the sort of stories I was thinking when working on this.\n<blockquote>I'm super curious, actually, why this is a TQY hack.

I had thought that was <i>fundamental</i> as opposed to projects' and map's <i>central</i>. It changes the game dramatically, but at the core it still adheres to what TQY does. I am not sure if it really stands on its own.<br/><br/>----<br/><br/>Wow, thanks for the feedback. When I first shared this on a Korean community, I heard nothing critical. I'm glad I decided to share this here.<br/><br/>Projects seem like a huge oversight from my side. I will look for a way to reincorporate it in the game.

Because both things are quiet; because the people involved cannot communicate clearly, and aren't necessarily sure what the best thing to do is at any given moment. And because things out of their control keep getting in the way of what it is they think they want.<br/><br/>For me, Introduce a Character doesn't quite work as a Start a Project replacement, only because if you introduce as many characters as you would projects you are going to end up with an enormous number of characters. I feel like this is going to be ultimately counter-productive to the goal of a character-centric game, but it may be that I am misunderstanding what you mean by that. If you mean you want the game to be about people, broadly, then it might work okay; if you want it to be about characterizing specific people or groups of people to the point that they become well-rounded/fully-realized, continually introducing more characters might be counter-productive.<br/><br/>The other thing that projects do that introducing a character won't is that the results of projects fundamentally change the direction of the game: the issues the community is grappling with, how the people in the community feel, and sometimes even who is still actually part of the community. Since these are the final days of high school, presumably almost all the characters being 'introduced' are only being introduced to the audience/players -- they will all have been at the high school for some amount of time previously, already have (unexplored) relationships and patterns of interaction, etc. This could be fine, of course, if change is not as important; if the goal is to aim for something much more elegaic and reflective, rather than hopeful/ambitious.<br/><br/>But I am also not sure it works because where are you going to get this characterization from, once you have the characters -- if not from the characters trying to do things? There is usually lots of characterization in a regular game of The Quiet Year; the game just constrains the players in how they can express what they imagine to be character desires. The OP mentions changing Hold A Discussion so that "the players can borrow the perspective of in-game characters" -- but no change seems necessary, as this already happens in TQY. Who do you think is talking in the discussions, if not in-game characters? In my experience playing the game, by the mid-point and onwards I am almost always speaking from a specific in-game perspective. I just don't explain who I am before I talk.<br/><br/>I don't think that a high-school hack needs to constrain expression of character in the same way the original game does; but I think constraining it in some way is necessary if the goal is to make use of some of the insights and strengths the original game provides.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433869">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/szp" title="szp"><img alt="szp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/191/n7DTE2GEA3S70.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/szp">szp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433869/#Comment_433869" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-15T17:39:45+00:00" title="June 15, 2014  5:39PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>What is the advantage of having cliques exist mechanically, instead of simply narratively?

Setting aside cliques for a second, how do you imagine this bit of narrative being expressed in the game? If these are the sorts of things you want to see happen, where would that fit in the structure of the game? As a rumour, directly described? As a discussion, indirectly referenced? As a discussion, played out like a scene between the characters in question? As a project (the 'humiliating prank') and its failure/resolution?<br/><br/>In the current game these sort of conflicts are expressed indirectly through choice of projects, indirectly or sometimes directly through holding a discussion, and then sometimes are described as part of someone resolving a project. The latter is the only case where I would expect to see anything described as explicitly as you put it; i.e. "So the 'humiliate the nerds' project fails, and it turns out it's because one of the jocks was sympathetic and confronted the other jocks, ruining the whole thing." (This would result from a card that required a project to fail, presumably.)<br/><br/>But mostly it would be expressed indirectly. Someone starts the project "humiliate the nerds" and the players imagine that this represents the desires of a specific part of the community (the jocks), which may have been described before or not. Then maybe someone starts a discussion about the project, and someone is like "This is great, somebody needs to put those losers in their place" and somebody else is like "this is stupid, nerds are cool" and someone else is like "I dunno, I tried playing D&amp;D once and it was kind of interesting..." and a fourth person just says "why can't you just leave me alone?" But we don't know who these people are, we just know there are these different opinions about humiliating nerds. Etc. etc.<br/><br/>So it seems worth thinking about whether this would fit into the current game, or if you need to find new space in the structure so players can tell these stories more directly -- all assuming you decide you want 'the jock stands up to the other jocks about nerds because he thinks they're ok' to be a thing that happens explicitly at all.<br/>\n<blockquote>I'm stumped.

It's your hack after all, none of us are likely to make the game, even if we have lots of opinions about it.<br/><br/>But in general hacking a game -- as opposed to reskinning it (see: 90% of all AW hacks) -- is a good way to learn more about how the original game really does what it does.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433880">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433880/#Comment_433880" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-15T20:52:34+00:00" title="June 15, 2014  8:52PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All hail the Emperor of Ice Cream.

As a discussion, played out like a scene between the characters in question? As a project (the 'humiliating prank') and its failure/resolution?</blockquote>\nI'm seeing two ways. Once a project gets underway, either someone Introduces a Character ("the Jocks are trying to figure out what they are gonna do, but let me introduce Chad, who is a D&amp;D-playing football player") or Holds a Discussion from the characters' perspective like you mentioned. In the case of the former, if someone likes the conflict seed, they could take an action or tell a story related to it. In the case of the latter, it would be as was described.<br/><br/>Individual character-level conflict is still something that needs to be refined... I'm getting really good ideas from this thread. Thanks for that.\n<blockquote>But in general hacking a game -- as opposed to reskinning it (see: 90% of all AW hacks) -- is a good way to learn more about how the original game really does what it does.</blockquote>\nI'm learning that right now. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> Now that I did something like this and had a discussion like this, I can't wait 'til I play The Quiet Year again.

It's still work-in-progress, though, and the effects of some changes are still uncertain.<br/><br/><b>Perspective -</b><br/>The Quiet Days happens in past tense. This is to better represent the reflective feel of the stories told by this hack. I have not actually tried this out yet, but this could be a very significant change from the original. Heck, it might even be the biggest change. The first playtest (which will happen in a few days, if God may permit) will do both present tense and past tense. I will report how it goes.<br/><br/><b>Yearbook -</b><br/>The progress of the story is now tracked and represented by a small pamphlet (a few A4s stapled along the center), which will become the graduating class's yearbook/graduation album. It's still like the original journal in some ways, but the format is more open now - if you have the ability, draw in small photographs in the pages. You can represent the relationships between students with signatures and messages from one to another. The timeline of the last eventful month could fill a page or two. Descriptions of student groups and cliques could go somewhere, too.<br/><br/>All in all, the yearbook is meant to be a collection of memories to be told during the game in any form or shape.<br/><br/><b>Actions -</b><br/>Actions are revised.<br/><br/><i>Remember that kid?</i>: This action introduces a new character to the story. Declare that you are taking this action and say "Remember (name)? That kid who..." followed by a one-phrase description. Now this character exists in the story and must be reflected in the yearbook.<br/><br/><i>Remember that rumor?</i>: This action introduces a new event or situation in the story. Declare that you are taking this action and say "There was a rumor that..." followed by a one-phrase description. Now this event or situation has happened somewhere in the story and must be reflected in the yearbook.<br/><br/><i>Remember that plan?</i>: This action introduces a plan or an attempt made by a group of characters, which may be the faculty, a clique or something entirely else. Plans are very much like projects in The Quiet Year, but when a plan is made, clarify who are trying to accomplish it. When the plan's dice is finished, reflect what happened in the yearbook.<br/><br/><i>Just what were you thinking?</i>: This action is like Hold a Discussion. The perspective, however, must be those of in-story characters. Like before, nobody exactly owns any character.<br/><br/>----<br/><br/>Now that I typed this up again... The past tense thing might be too revolutionary. I think it brings the actual project closer to my vision, but-- GAH. I think the only way to really shape my opinion is through playtesting.<br/><br/>&gt;_&lt;                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433934">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433934/#Comment_433934" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-16T22:25:07+00:00" title="June 16, 2014 10:25PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/>I think the shift to past tense is absolutely worth trying out; it is definitely a big change, but one that could put a lot of things into focus.
