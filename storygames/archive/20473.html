Action scenes can be blood-pumping, adrenalin-rush-inducing and quick in a visual medium, but not so much in a verbal medium. RPGs can do this sort of scene without problems, and it can be really good. You can do bullet-time stuff, focus on the emotions of the characters and all that, but you're not gonna get cinematic action in an RPG. As the wise Johan Rising once said: "Dialogues are the actions scenes of RPGs", not actual action scenes.<br/><br/>That said, there have been attempts, more or less successful. The Comittee for the Exploration of Mysteries springs to mind, with its times action scenes where you lose the challenge if the timer runs out. Maybe that sort of thing with an app that allows you to add time to the timer, forcing the players to divide their actions between buying more time and overcoming the challenge?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449996">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/davidepignedoli" title="davidepignedoli"><img alt="davidepignedoli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/davidepignedoli">davidepignedoli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449996/#Comment_449996" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-14T17:52:20+00:00" title="December 14, 2015  5:52PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">@Simon_Pettersson</a> thanks for the advice.

Specially playing with no grid. <br/>3) Frame scenes in movement. You need to get more vocabulary and mental images to describe things like that, this is where the references mentioned in 1 come into play. Narrate how great distances are covered quickly. Distances doesn't matter, what matters is the next obstacle. Eliminate "distance" from the list of obstacles altogether.<br/>4) Obstacles doesn't need to be lethal, just able to stall the characters. The lethal thing is getting stalled enough to fall behind.<br/>5) The only positional situation that matters will be "who is first and in which order are the characters after that?" Actually, you can use a single line of a grid for this, despite what I wrote above. Only, each space of the grid represents the distance crossed in one turn.<br/><br/>I was able to manage narrating a fight/pursuit across a whole city in under a one hour real time lapse, improvising most of it over the city map. It was a totally frantic session, so I can assure that the atmosphere is perfectly doable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir" title="Thanuir"><img alt="Thanuir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir">Thanuir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450084/#Comment_450084" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-17T10:40:43+00:00" title="December 17, 2015 10:40AM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1.

So this time limit was applied to the entire session, making us all stressed all the time, and since the two GMs had to coordinate (we were all in the same room) as we split up and recombined, it ended in a lot of shouting, a crapload of confusion (other GM shouts "The theatre stage explodes!" and we, who are on the stage (as well as our GM) have no idea why, but we are sent flying) and tons of hilarious fun. So that's what I'd recommend. Set a timer for the entire session and if you're not out when it beeps, you're dead. That really cuts out the long winded descriptions.<br/><br/>EDIT: This is a very rules-light game, basically D6 below attribute.
