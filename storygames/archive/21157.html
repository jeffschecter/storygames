A larp you can acquire a written scenario for on the Internet is more likely to be in this category.<br/><br/>I was in the opposite place sometimes, where the player base I was catering to demanded more larp scenarios and I ended up "larpifying" games that were originally designed for the tabletop, such as <i>Montsegur 1244</i>.<br/><br/>The main insight I got is: the key design difference between a replayable larp scenario vs. a one-shot tabletop role-playing scenario lies not in stage production values, but in expectations about out-of-character talk.<br/><br/>With a few notable exceptions, tabletop RPG players are expected to be casual and fluid in switching between "in character" and "OOC" talk. OOC talk is, in fact, a valuable and - probably - necessary tool for building a shared imagined space. Getting small cues as to when a player is speaking <i>for</i> their character, when they're stating what they're character <i>does</i> and when they're, you know, <i>just talking</i> (but that talking isn't a game "move" per se) is a key, basic player skill.<br/><br/>Larp structures the conversation more formally in these regards. With several exceptions, players in a larp are expected to <i>always</i> be speaking in their character's voice, to always being acting out or at least miming their character's actions and body language, and to never be chatting out of character. Departures from that default situations are to be clearly signaled to other players, often only happen as prescribed by the game designer (or organizer), and are in fact what a large portion of larp design work is about - encoding OOC signals, defining areas you can't play out in-character, structuring play time into in-character moments and OOC breaks, and so on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463733">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463733/#Comment_463733" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-06T12:22:30+00:00" title="June  6, 2017 12:22PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, Rafu! <i>JUGGERNAUT </i>in particular is intended to be always on once you start play. Of course you can break character to clarify or explain or ask a question, but by design that is an aberration. Compare with <i>The Climb</i>, where explicitly OOC stuff goes on, and half the players will have OOC tasks to accomplish, and this is clearly spelled out. Both games are easy for tabletop folks to understand and play, but they approach things very differently.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">@Jeff_B_Slater</a> are you looking for freeform games and larps that translate well to a tabletop experience? You might look at some of the Fastaval games, which are usually intended to be played in a sort of hybrid mode. I recommend Vasen Road and Dulce et Decorum particularly.<br/><br/><a href="http://alexandria.dk/english" rel="nofollow">http://alexandria.dk/english</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463741">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Charlie_X" title="Charlie_X"><img alt="Charlie_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/513/nSBLNVCY6RNQO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Charlie_X">Charlie_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463741/#Comment_463741" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-06T18:59:50+00:00" title="June  6, 2017  6:59PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played Juggernaut with a bunch of us stood about in a room with lab coats and a really shaky makeshift "Juggernaut", but it could have easily been around a table. I think it added a little something where we were able to pace dramatically, have quiet breakdowns on the sofa, shout at the machine and then all hit the floor when... things happened. But still, it's all doable in tabletop mode.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
