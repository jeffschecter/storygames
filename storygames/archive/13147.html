One of the players invited her brother, a non-gamer, so I decided to run something light and straight-forward for his first gaming experience. I very nearly started to put together a paired down version of the Apocalypse World rules when I stumbled across the Ghost/Echo pdf on my hard drive (duh!).</p>\n<p>Since we don't know what type of story we'll be playing, what I ended up doing is putting together a very simple, <a href="https://docs.google.com/fileview?id=0BwcxFlnj_3wVOTFjZWE0M2QtZWU1Yy00MGY1LWE2MjctOGM3YzIyOTEyYWM2&amp;hl=en&amp;authkey=CJTq-vIP" rel="nofollow">one-page trifold</a> of the Ghost/Echo rules with the cyber-punk color removed. I also added the Gift of Dice rule from TSoY and space to fill in a couple setting/genre specific Goals and Dangers.</p>\n<p>Mostly likely what we'll do is have a quick brainstorming session about the story's setting and characters, then fill in the custom goals and dangers, marking down any notes needed on 3x5 cards as we go.</p>\n<p>I have yet to run Ghost/Echo (though I have run it's close descendant, Apocalypse World), so I have one question: When a character <strong>commits to violence</strong>, the danger is that they "cause unintended harm". At first, the range of possible outcomes from this realized danger was pretty narrow in my imagination, until I came to the conclusion that the unintended might not be limited to other PCs, innocent bystanders or props or scenery. Would it be too much of a stretch (or to harsh) to include the PC them self or their equipment as the recipient of the unintended harm?</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_296238">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296238/#Comment_296238" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-08T07:21:06+00:00" title="October  8, 2010  7:21AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That wouldn't be a stretch <i>at all</i> in my game.

So, harm to the PC and/or that PC's stuff is all fair game.<br><br>You're not strictly limited to the consequence listed with a move, either, that's just the most obvious danger. You should switch it up sometimes, depending on teh actual situation in play. Another idea I mentioned in that other thread is allowing other players to create dangers. In one of my group's games, Daniel was asked for a danger for his roll, and Andrew said "The danger is you lose my character's respect."                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
