After talking about it with a friend who's big into them (total City of Heroes/Villains addict, currently playing WoW a whole lot), I think I need to know more about these games. The problem is that for reasons not particularly relevant to this thread, I can't stand the genre, so I can't really learn about it by immersing myself in them. Time permitting I'll probably read up on the subject in library books, but I'm hoping the S-G crowd can help enlighten me.<br/><br/>The main thing I want to understand is how people come together and socialize in the context of an MMO, how that develops into communities of various sorts, and how the games themselves play into that. What attracts people to these games, and what is it about them that keeps them there for such ridiculous lengths of time?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_191226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wirebrain" title="Wirebrain"><img alt="Wirebrain" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wirebrain">Wirebrain</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191226/#Comment_191226" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-04T14:51:18+00:00" title="February  4, 2009  2:51PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            After asking a Co-worker about his MMO addictions, he seemed to have been drawn more towards the games due to player interaction. He couldn't stand playing against computer opponents for long and enjoy set standings that one has to work for (Levels, Military Rank) and being recognized for it by the other players through leaderboards, challenges and strategic Player vs Player competition. He also enjoyed the stories of the world, but couldn't give a care about the style, setting look or theme of the games. The promise of constant updates also is a big carrot to him.<br/><br/>For myself, I'm the polar opposite outside of reading the stories. I prefer meeting people, role playing my character, enjoying the setting while progressing through computer opponents with my new team-mates. I don't care about Player vs Player combat, as that is one of the major reasons I stay away from World of Warcraft.  I tend to stick to places where I actually can talk to people. Too often I'll wander into games where no one can be bothered to say "hi" or if they do, break out AIM level spelling. I notice this is more frequent in the free-to-play games rather than the subscription based models. I'll barely pay ANY attention to the forums. I'd rather be playing the game than just talking about it. Nor do I care about selling items I've earned or found. If I got a blaster pistol and my guy can only use laser swords, first guy in my group or a total new player is getting it - It's a pretend item that will go away if not kept, so why not have it go to someone who can use it?<br/><br/>I've noticed other people try to collect all kinds of items and costumes in game, quickly signing up to do something "new" and others who want to be there for the long run and make an "investment" out of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_191229">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191229/#Comment_191229" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-04T15:10:19+00:00" title="February  4, 2009  3:10PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A lot of the things about MMO communities are side effects of how they are constructed (i.e. internet anonymity, no actual meetings), which won't really translate to your game well, I think.<br/><br/>In terms of how the games are set up to encourage teaming up, the key things are:<br/>- Encounters that are too tough for a single person to beat.<br/>- Encounters that require specific abilities that no one character will have all of. An aspect of this is encounters or creatures that behave differently during different phases of the fight and will require coordinated tactics as well as specific powers to take out.<br/><br/>And the reason to go for these harder critters?

Socializing with people of like interests (whether friends you already know or random new people, in varying proportions), multiplayer PVP combat, cooperative PVE combat, crafting items, role-playing, accumulating power and other goodies, and...?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_191239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Richie" title="Richie"><img alt="Richie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Richie">Richie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191239/#Comment_191239" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-04T15:59:32+00:00" title="February  4, 2009  3:59PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Having played a few and seeing other people play them I think leveling is a big draw. Leveling anything almost. I guess it's a sense of concrete achievement you don't get from real life. In the game it's a stat. You earned that stat and there it is, if you get what I'm saying.<br/><br/>On the crafting thing I agree that is another huge draw. Unfortunately from what I have seen most MMOs don't even come close to creative enough for me. Glad to hear you're gonna take a stab at that aspect, although I don't know how well it would translate to tabletop. Being able to make an actual object that exists in the game is cool but much more variability would be cooler, i.e. being able to change colour, appearance, fuctions, etc. My experience of crafting in tabletop games (I've played) is even when there are great rules for it they don't tend to be used. Maybe there is something in the object actually manifesting in a virtual world which is the difference. I know that I've been all excited over kick ass crafting rules and never gotten much play out of them in the end, but that may be just my experience I dunno.<br/><br/>I just downloaded your pdf, I'll give it a skim.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_191254">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SeleneTan" title="SeleneTan"><img alt="SeleneTan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/264/nRW74G3J2K4XC.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SeleneTan">SeleneTan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191254/#Comment_191254" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-04T20:58:42+00:00" title="February  4, 2009  8:58PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you haven't checked it out already, <a href="http://www.nickyee.com/daedalus/" rel="nofollow">The Daedalus Project</a> is an ongoing study of psychological/sociological aspects of MMORPGs.

I myself have sank far, far too many hours into that game, so I think I can offer you some insights. <br/>First of all, I'd have to say that there would be no way that I would have played for nearly as long as I did if not for my friends who also play (my one friend absolutely loves it, and my brother got pretty into it as well). I enjoy the socialization aspect with them, and the game provides a decent framework for that. <br/><br/>One of the main things with Maple Story, even over other MMOs is the level grind- hours upon hours of killing the same enemies over and over again. While this can get boring, I actually find it kind of calming, and I relate it more to watching TV than playing a game- something mindless you can do to unwind. <br/><br/>The constant search for new abilities plays into it too, and I started many a new character, both to try the other abilities and for the fact that new characters are much easier to level. Also, I found that I would often spend a long time trading, buying, and selling items, optimizing builds, and trying to get the best equipment for the best price. Even though the actual impact these items have on your rate of leveling is minimal (you'd certainly be better off training in the time you spend shopping for items if you want to level up fast) but as I played more and more, this became almost more of the game than the actual game. Part of this has to do with just the fun of shopping, like how some people really love looking through ebay for the best deals (in fact Maple Story has its own ebay, basilmarket.com, but thats another story entirely). I also enjoyed going about the forums and stuff, and talking to the people.<br/><br/>I guess in the end it sort of goes in a cycle: first everything in the game is new, so you enjoy it as a game, then you get more into discussions and community, and then you can go explore new areas that have that new car smell whenever they get released. Its not the best formula, but it had me hooked for quite a while.<br/><br/>Hope that helped. If you have any more questions, feel free to utilize my vast knowledge of everything Korean MMO.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_191274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191274/#Comment_191274" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-05T06:58:44+00:00" title="February  5, 2009  6:58AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            LFG?<br/><br/>In World of Warcraft, you have guilds. Generally, creating a guild is a terribly easy thing to do, then you just invite people to join it. Why? Self-interest. Guild members are expected to help each other on quests, share crafting materials, and make stuff for one another. In other words, people can specialize and the whole guild benefits. At higher levels, guilds raid together. The better guilds will have some kind of communication off the game: a web forum, Skype conversations, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_191339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191339/#Comment_191339" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-05T14:48:51+00:00" title="February  5, 2009  2:48PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I play MMOs (e.g. ATiTD and Wurm Online) where the world is largely persistent and there are huge projects that no one (sane) person could hope to accomplish on their own.  So, the people who want to engage in that kind of play are required to come together socially and work out who's doing what.  I have made genuine friendships in these environments.  I have played the more mainstream games: EQ, COH/V, WOW, etc.  In those games I largely failed to engage socially.  The socialization was really pretty thin and dull.
