They're all board game people, but we've had a bit of luck introducing them to story games/RPGs, and I'm taking my copy of <i>Fiasco</i> along. A couple of them have seen the Tabletop episode and know what to expect, the rest are kind of in the dark.<br/><br/>I'm wondering if you guys had any recommendations as to some good playsets for Fiasco beginners. I've not played it yet myself, but I've read the book and think I have a pretty good handle on it. The interest list amongst the group is strongly varied, so there's no specific flavour we're going for. Just kind of interested in suggestions.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398968">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398968/#Comment_398968" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-28T04:33:53+00:00" title="November 28, 2012  4:33AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you are facilitating, bring three you really like and let the players choose from that assortment.

I think a playset everyone has seen a core movie of is a great place to start.<br/><br/>Depending on the experience of the players I find emphasising that this works in the opposite way to the games they are used to often helps: that you will "win" when your character crashes and burns not when they achieve their goals.

(Not so much an issue with more experienced players, but this direction may help newbies have a tighter, more focused experience.)<br/>3) Newbies may have an urge to plan out everything as table talk instead of in-character scenes; help them resist this urge.<br/>4) If you are playing with board gamers, some may overly concentrate on the "right" mix of dice they will need for their character to "win" the game. Try to help steer them from that. Explain the end-game rolls, but keep it high-level. Reiterate that it's a cooperative experience (perhaps even avoid the word "game"). If they still seem intent on "gaming" it, tell them the "winner" us the one who enjoys the experience the most, and in many cases this is the person whose character gets a huge helping of degradation, pain and suffering.<br/>5) When talking about scenes, explain that flashbacks and flash forwards are cool... in the right context. If your new players attempt to set a scene out of chronological order, ask them why. If it makes sense, go for it! If it's a "just because" answer and the scene could easily take place in regular chronological sequencing, suggest they try it that way. (Just something I've run into with some overzealous new players that can add unnecessary complications and more time spent at the table trying to unravel timelines than playing scenes; not an issue for more experienced players.)<br/><br/>Have fun!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_399069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo" title="w00hoo"><img alt="w00hoo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/395/nB2PXS15U6BFQ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo">w00hoo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399069/#Comment_399069" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-28T22:53:16+00:00" title="November 28, 2012 10:53PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd avoid The Ice (but this might just be a UK thing as we don't understand cold isolation) we picked it as the first try play set with one of my groups and it crashed &amp; burnt, I've since talked to others in the UK who've had similar experiences (in that I'd start explaining that a session didn't work for us and they'd ask 'we're you playing The Ice?').

Three makes for a fast game and five for a slow one. 16 scenes is just right.<br/>* With 4, have two Needs and engineer them opposite one another. If one player touches two Needs, the game will be about that character. Normally this is fine but for a first game it's good form to avoid it.<br/>* Strongly model the behavior you want to see. <br/>* Guide the game. Help another player Establish the first scene if you can, avoiding putting yourself, as facilitator, at the beginning or end of scene rotation.<br/>* It is often satisfying to skip the montage and ask each player to describe the overall outcome for their character.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_399097">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo" title="w00hoo"><img alt="w00hoo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/395/nB2PXS15U6BFQ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo">w00hoo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399097/#Comment_399097" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-29T05:46:09+00:00" title="November 29, 2012  5:46AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To unpack my comment a little. It wasn't the first game of Fiasco I'd played (I'd just come from an event that had seen me play a couple of very good games as my introduction to the game). My initial advice, which I've stuck to pretty much ever since (I mostly play Fiasco at conventions with people I've not played it with before) was 4 players, 2 Needs, 1 Location, 1 Object. To the point that now typing that I can't remember if it's in the rules that way or not. I'm not sure the game was right for my home group, but we'd almost all turned up to the fortnightly session and couldn't do the scheduled game because we were players down, at which point I produced Fiasco from the bag.<br/><br/>The game worked for a couple of us (who worked quite hard to make that happen) and didn't for a couple. It went very gonzo (I vaguely recall something about drugs being smuggled inside penguins and the constanct shuffling of the location of a dead body) and as a group we didnt' touch it again for probably 18 months (the second run went better than the first, but I can't remember the playset we chose.) That's not as odd as it might sound, that group generally plays long campaigns with very few one shot games if any.<br/><br/>Talking about this later with other people who'd played a lot of Fiasco there was a feeling that there was something about 'The Ice' that made it attractive to groups less likely to get in to the game. As I say, this could be a UK thing. It could be down to the small sample size, it could just be a feeling that's plain wrong. I don't know. I know when I go to Con's now and offer Fiasco it's not among the dozen or so playsets I bring along 'just in case'.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399237/#Comment_399237" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-30T10:14:30+00:00" title="November 30, 2012 10:14AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think <i>Transatlantic</i> has a more universal hook than <i>Gangster London</i>.
