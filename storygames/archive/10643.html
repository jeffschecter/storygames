It\u2019s been brief, yet so cool I felt compelled to write down an AP. It\u2019s been tough at first to have to think perpendicular stakes, but after an initial part in which we tried a conflict for the sake of seeing how it works, some really interesting stakes came out and the game went smooth pretty quickly. Especially the third phase has been quite interesting.<br/>\nNow, I have to make a disclaimer: I\u2019m not sure I remember all the details as some time has passed. The game was played in two sessions total. <br/>\n<br/>\nSince it was my first time playing, I\u2019ve been given the right to choose the setting by introducing my character, and I set the game in a space station not unlike the one that can be found in 2001: a Space Odyssey, orbiting around the giant gas planet called 47 Ursae Majoris b . The Janus 01 orbiting station had been created in order to observe strange refractions in the radio waves around the gravitational field of the planet. Due to the fruitlessness of these researches, the station has been gradually abandoned, and the population that was initially beyond 100 people, had decreased to less than thirty people. However, in the last weeks strange accidents, deaths and disappearings had started taking place, and at the moment of the game\u2019s beginning, only ten members of the staff are present. The PC are:<br/>\n<br/>\nID: Cohen, Jacob \u2013 informatics expert (played by Antonio)<br/>\nSecret: symbiosis with an alien creature<br/>\nVulnerability: I\u2019ve been victim of frequent, harsh ill-treatments when I was younger<br/>\n<br/>\nID: Senners, Alcyone \u2013 bothanist (played by me)<br/>\nSecret: I see people that should not be there<br/>\nVulnerability: addiction to pyschotropic drugs<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo NPC of note were Capt.Kowalski, commander of the station, and dr.Hammers, medic.<br/>\nThe game opens up in a scene in which Alcyone is listening to Ludwig Van after a shot. Due to a blackout the artificial gravity was temporarily absent, and she\u2019s floating in her greenhouse, where both specimen for study purpose and a large vegetable garden are kept. The room is merged in a blueish dim light reflected by the planet. <br/>\nOne of the station\u2019s assistants sneaks in the greenhouse trying to steal one of the plants, an alien orchid type flower. That was a warm up conflict in which Antonio patiently explained the rules to me. This one ends up in Alcyone\u2019s favor, and she chases the indruder away.<br/>\nIt\u2019s then my turn to be the story guide, and the scene changes to show us Jacob in his cabin, working on a console in order to understand the blackout\u2019s origin. The door at his back opens and Capt.Kowalski enters. Skipping pleasantries, he asks Jacob if he has determined the causes for the blackout, and seeing that he hasn\u2019t understood anything yet, he orders Jacob to put on a suit and get outside to check the energy panels of the station.<br/>\nOn his way to the spacesuits\u2019 room, Jacob meets Alcyone who offers her help. From now on, the scene sees the two of us together with our characters, although technically I\u2019m still story guide.<br/>\nDuring the controls, Alcyone notices an unknown figure moving without space suit on the external surface of the station, while Jacob is attacked, fails his achievement to manage to flee, and is instead dragged away, disappearing beyond a hatch which leads to a service corridor. After repressurizing the ambient, Jacob looks around, but no trace of the assaliant. He then tries to reach the others and finds out that in the meantime they had been gathering near one of the external rooms. They\u2019re standing around Alcyone, laying on the floor in cathatonic state.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlcyone opens her eyes, finding herself in the infirmary of the Janus 01. She doesn\u2019t remember anything after Jacob being dragged away, so great was the surprise to see him entering the infirmary safe and sound, concerned for her health.<br/>\nThe two have a long dialogue in which they exchange impressions on what had been happening: nobody seems to have noticed any unknown person outside the station, let alone one who wasn\u2019t wearing a spacesuit. Alcyone and Jacob know that what they\u2019ve seen was real, and start feeling suspicion about the other people who so readily dismiss the whole thing as a mere collective hallucination.Jacob starts investigating the matter by first checking the spacesuits they had been using during the inspection. No damage on his one, but Alcyone\u2019s suit sports a small hole rimmed with a blueish substance on the base of the neck. Thanks to some miracle, the corrosion had stopped before the hole broke the suit\u2019s pressurization.<br/>\nOn his way back to Alcyone\u2019s greenhouse, he meets Capt.Kowalski again, and can\u2019t help noticing a small blueish spot on his neck. Frightened, he speeds up until he meet with the bothanist which is facing a greenhouse in which most plants have gone through some incredible mutations.<br/>\nThe two discuss what to do, and Alcyone hypothesizes that some sort of contamination had been spread through the station\u2019s water pipes. That would be the only possible explanation for such a rapid and widespread mutation. Somebody must have been poisoning the water supply and disabling the purification and filtering system.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere we enter the third phase of the game in which our heroes try to find a way to the idric sytem of the orbiting station by passing through service corridoors and air ducts, hoping to restore its\u2019 functioning, and possibly discover what is happening in the station.<br/>\nDue to a malfunctioning hatch which suddenly closes separating the two, Alcyone and Jacob have to continue on separate ways. Alcyone runs across dr.Hammers, clearly infected by the mutagen substance. That was the coolest conflict we played. Achievement were \u201cI don\u2019t give in to the vampire\u201d and \u201cI manage to kill the doctor\u201d. Consequences were \u201cI manage to get a weapon\u201d and, to Antonio\u2019s credit, \u201cI gain the marks of the infection\u201d. The conflict is a partial success. I get hold on the knife held by Hammers, kills him but breaks the knife in his chest. A spray of his blood gets on her eyes.<br/>\nJacob, on the other hand, manages to escape from a squad of men led by Capt.Kowalsky by hiding in an air duct, and reaches the water pools, where the \u2018vampire\u2019 was waiting for him.<br/>\nAt this point I was the story guide, and I gave my best in interpreting the creature. Were it not for the blue-on blue pupil-less eyes, the uninvited guest looks just like a human being. It (he?) starts explaining that all he had been doing had been done for the good of the station\u2019s inhabitants. He is probably the last survivors of a parasite species made made of sentient energy. The radiations coming from 47 Ursae Majoris b (which were the cause for the strange deviations in the radio waves around the gravitational field of the planet) were irradiating the Janus 01, taking its inhabitants to a slow death without any recognizable symptoms. In order to avoid that, the creature did the only thing it could do in order to survive together with the humans: turning them in her progeny, thus making them immune to the planet\u2019s radiations.<br/>\nThe creature offers Jacob to join him, but he refuses. The \u2018vampire\u2019 then chooses to attack Jacob and easily disarms him. The following conflict has a disastrous effect on our hero, which however chooses to flip his Secret trait, the alien possession.<br/>\nFor a brief moment, the creature has the upper hand, when Jacob reveals his true nature: his veins emit a pulsing golden light that spreads through the vampire\u2019s fingers, first enveloping its hands, then the arms, and finally the entire body. It tries to twist away, but soon is overwhelmed and finally explodes in charred fragments.<br/>\nWhen Jacob turns, he sees a dismayed Alcyone, who has seen the entire scene. Her eyes are of the same blue on blue of the creature\u2019s progeny.<br/>\nAlarmed by the sight, Jacob is ready to attack her, while frightened by the sight, she turns away and sees a reflection of her face on the wayer. It is then that she notices her own eyes\u2019 color for the first time. Terrorized, she is also forced to realize that Jacob believes her to be just one of the infested humans, and with a trembling voice, she manages to convince him that she hasn\u2019t become like the others, as unexplainable as it may sound.<br/>\nThe two of them face each other, realizing that the only two persons still maintaining their mind aren\u2019t human anymore. They would be rejected by the world of men wherever they chose to go. The epilogue is a touching scene in which Jacob suggests that the two die together while destroying the Janus 01, eventually giving up to Alcyone\u2019s plea to use one of the shuttles and reach a semi-desert planet where they could live together and apart from a civilization that could no longer accept them. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I think we got some rules wrong at the beginning, eventually adjusting our conflicts so that the next ones corrected the previous mistakes. It\u2019s been tough to remember all the coin retrieval mechanics in traits and reserve.<br/>\nIt\u2019s been, however, one of the few games intended for a group of player that also splendidly worked just in two.<br/>\nI\u2019m glad that it will soon be translated and released in an Italian edition (FYI, Antonio and I are Italians). I hope the author will come and visit us sooner or later...<br/>\n<br/>\nPS: [url=http://www.gdrutopia.com/images/annalise.jpg]here[/url] is a character sheet I created for the occasion.

Jacob flipping his Secret trait at the end to destroy the Vampire is exactly the kind of thing I like to see, and that epilogue is really touching and sad. I'm glad you guys worked through getting used to the system in good order, it sounds like it was a lot of fun.<br/><br/>That character sheet is pretty sweet, do you mind if I put it up on the site as a download?<br/><br/>It sounds like the Italian translation is moving right along! Man, I would love to go back to Italy. Some day, hopefully sooner rather than later...<br/><br/>Thanks for playing!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Suna" title="Suna"><img alt="Suna" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Suna">Suna</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236310/#Comment_236310" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-08T08:09:25+00:00" title="October  8, 2009  8:09AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            By all means please feel free to use/upload the character sheet, I'd be honored if you would, actually!<br/>\nYes, I know that the italian translation will be released by the end of October. Can't wait to see it. And it would be sweet if you came.<br/>\nI know that Jason Morningstar did come to Italy and meet publishers here, and by reading his blog, it seems like he enjoyed the time.<br/>\nWe've started another game by the way. Most players are used to traditional rpgs so the pace is kind of slow for now. We've set it in 1100's Jerusalem (much influence from Ridley Scott's Kingdom of Heaven and Assassin's Creed). I hope the new players will love the game as much as Antonio and I did :)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
