                    So in the car on the way to the airport last Friday, I was telling Meredith about how Galactic allows for the death of primary characters, and she wasn't too keen on it, and I've been thinking about it on and off for the last week. I got only the briefest opportunity to talk to Vincent about it on Sunday, but it wasn't really much of a discussion, what with there being FIRE to distract us, fire with its flame and smoke and stuff. And also a looming thunderstorm.<br/>
<br/>
So, I remember once someone saying there's fates worse than death for characters, and I'm wondering what happens to play when you allow for it to happen vs. when you say it's not possible.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not expecting there to be a specific list, but the possibilities are really holding my attention right now.<br/>
<br/>
I'll give you an example: In Galactic, if the captain dies, the player picks a supporting character to sorta 'pick up the banner' and become the new captain. So if I'm playing Iona and Iona dies, I pick maybe Paco, who was previously played by John, and John creates a new crewmember to replace Paco.<br/>
<br/>
And that's pretty cool, I think.<br/>
<br/>
But the game would be totally different if the captain can't die. That option makes me think, kinda, of the Big Red One, where they keep on going and all their squadmates keep getting killed. You'd make it to the endgame and if you won, you'd have to look back on a complete epic's worth of hard decisions and loss and stuff. Ironically, it's darker than allowing for main character death.<br/>
<br/>
And that's pretty cool as well.<br/>
<br/>
So players and designers: what do you like or dislike about character death (or just removal from the game)? When designing a game, what makes you decide on death vs. not death? When in play have you had character death that was just kind of dull and unsatisfying? When was it awesome?                </div>

                            I'm running a Meat Loaf LARP on Saturday. Because of the whole Meat Loaf thing, it's really essential that characters can die, because they die a lot in Meat Loaf songs.<br/>
<br/>
So I've said that the first character to die gets a huge mechanical reward (they collect one Rock card from everyone in the room). I haven't told them what happens after they die or even whether they'll carry on playing. I'm kind of interested to see how they handle this.<br/>

                            Or as we say in "Illegal Gods," and our zombie games, "There's no rest for the wicked."  (Wasn't that the idea behind some of Deadlands?  "Death's too good fer 'em.")  I've always felt that character death should just be an entrance someplace else; someone could introduce a new character, or play through the death sequence (sometimes into new realms, depending on genre.)  With that in mind, you've removed a psychological barrier for many gamers; new consequences need be found to advance character development/experience.  Death of loved ones is a classic immortal's challenge.  Disability can be a good, frustrating experience.                        </div>

                            I had a big debate about allowing player character death in The Roach, because the way the game is structured PC death isn't a real impediment to play at all.  In the end I decided to explicitly forbid it, because it changes the focus in an unhealthy way and has the potential for stupid deprotagonizing.  It's just an arbitrary rule - you cannot kill another PC, ever, although you can kill your own in the final event if you want.  I'm having the same internal discussion with Grey Ranks, where keeping a PC alive will definitely seem like arbitrary punishment in certain circumstances, and the degradation of characters through socially ablative damage is central to the game.  For Galactic I'd be guided by the tone you want to set - both models you described would probably work, but definitey lead actual play in different directions.  Not helpful, perhaps...                        </div>

                            Character Death is part of the reason I'm going a little old school for my next game, and actually using the Shadowrun Rules* - I think it's a powerful and useful thing so long as everyone knows it's on the table.<br/>
<br/>
I got a lot of love of death back in my Rolemaster days.  Realistically, we didn't actually end up dying any more than we did in, say, D&amp;D, but there was always more of a sense of death being on the line.  The constant awareness that a critical could go just-so, and we could end up with our teeth driven into our brain.  Since we were definately all about strong character identification, it completely jacked up the tension, which in turn, jacked up the fun for us.<br/>
<br/>
I sort of moved past that, and on into games where death is somethign that just doesn't happen.  "Fates worth than death" certainly keep things interesting, especially because they keep the GM challenged, but the depend on a certain amount of infrastructure.  If you have players who are willing to invest their characters in something, then you still get tasty pain, but that really ends up undercutting certain sorts of grim and gritty play.<br/>
<br/>
So, as I go back to cyberpunk, which I want to be grim and gritty, I'm going crunchier, and putting death on the table, in hopes of recapturing some of that tension.<br/>
<br/>
So, having framed all that, I would throw onto the list:<br/>
<br/>
Why Allow Death?<br/>
 Pro<br/>
  * Risk forces characters to consider wider array of options to solve problems.<br/>
  * Without Death, players can turtle, or otherwise keep at arms length form enagement.<br/>
 * Risk of change (from character loss)  keeps everyone flexible and on their toes.<br/>
 * Surviving can be a valid victory<br/>
<br/>
Con<br/>
 * Risk paralyzes players, or causes the planning to action ratio to get completely skewed.<br/>
 * Death is Sad, and paperwork can be hard.<br/>
 * Can totally derail future plans<br/>
 * Requires extra layer of rules padding to keep death from being _too_ common.<br/>
 * Most GM-abusable thing evar.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There's more, but I figured it worth starting somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
-Rob D.<br/>
<br/>
* - That was the intention.  Having since discovered that a light pistol still won't even kill the old an infirm has sort of thrown this into question.                        </div>

<p>I think a protagonist dying is an action like any other: it's a statement a player can make.</p>
<p>In some cases (like in Dogs), you're saying "My dude is willing to risk his life on this."</p>
<p>In some cases (like in Shock:), you're saying "My Protag dying is a way to make a final point."</p>
<p>In other cases (like in GURPS), death is a risk of strategic resources.</p>
<p>Those are all valid reasons to have protagonist death, I think. It only becomes unsatisfying if you're breaking the game on what death means. If you get a spectacularly unlucky series of rolls and die from a fistfight in Dogs. If you accidentally stake your Protag's life too early in Shock: Or if GM fiat kills your character or keeps you from properly risking it in GURPS.</p>

<p>* Risk forces characters to consider wider array of options to solve problems.</p>
<p>How so? If death is on the line, that narrows options. It makes things risky.</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<ul>
<li>Without Death, players can turtle, or otherwise keep at arms length form enagement.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Things like character death are a primary reason that players turtle. If protag death means that a player loses the ability to play, death is a way of shutting down a player, and turtling is defensive.</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<ul>
<li>Risk of change (from character loss) keeps everyone flexible and on their toes.</li>

<p>Only if the rules prevent or discourage character development.</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<ul>
<li>Surviving can be a valid victory</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Sure, it can, but it never is in fiction. Survival is meaningful: "I survived and kept my dignity," or "I survived but proved that we're no more than animals when the chips are down," or "I didn't survive, but I saved the thing I cared about."</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>Con</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>* Risk paralyzes players, or causes the planning to action ratio to get completely skewed.</p>
<p>Only if death means a loss of player resources, including time.</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<ul>
<li>Death is Sad, and paperwork can be hard.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Those are totally separate things, of course. The sadness of death is a very powerful element in a story. That's why it happens.</p>
<p>The difficulty of the paperwork is an issue of game design.</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<ul>
<li>Can totally derail future plans</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Whose? And why was a player actually risking the life of the Protagonist on something that didn't matter as much as whatever those future plans were?</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<ul>
<li>Requires extra layer of rules padding to keep death from being <em>too</em> common.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Total game design issue. Death should be appropriately common for the type of story you're building.</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<ul>
<li>Most GM-abusable thing evar.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Again, a game design issue. If the rules state (for instance) that the protags can only be killed by other protags, or that if a protag dies, she automatically gets what she wants out of the conflict, that's not true. That's just a broken rule you're talking about there.</p>

                            Heh, I'd rather not fisk too much, so for at least some of those, assume the pros and cons are supposed to cancel out. .  Still, a few of the points fall out of that, so:<br/>
<br/>
 * If death is a potential outcome, players have a vested interest in pursuign non-violent solutiosn ot problems.  This is obviously somethign more in the traditional adventuring mold, but it's the reasonable response to risk: moving to minimize that risk.  to my mind, the _good_ minimization occurs when it forces players to be more creative.  The bad minimization occurs when it causes paralysis.<br/>
<br/>
* The sadness of death can also extend to the tabletop, which was mostly a flip way to reference the fact that it an spawn ill will.<br/>
<br/>
* The turtling that concerns me most is the emotional turtling.  The absence of death and the subsequent "fates worse than death" is a primary motivator for playing lame-ass sociopathic loners.  I considered the other sort of turtling addressed in the cons, but that was obviously unclear.<br/>
<br/>
The rest I'm sort of going to address in a broad swath:  Yes, you are absolutely correct in the bulk of your points, and I was short-sighted in assuming what went without saying.  These are not unaddressable issues, and I certainly hope I didn't imply that I thought they were.  The kicker is that simply saying "it can be addressed" is no kind of solution.  <br/>
<br/>
So I apologize for being unclear in that I was looking at things which have come up, not creating a theoretical framework.  Additionally, I apologize for whatever offense I have clearly offered you, as I genuinely have no idea what it may be.<br/>

<br/>
As we just discussed in chat, I think you're reading Rob's post outside of context.  He's talking about strong identification play and, specifically, about games like Shadowrun and Rolemaster.<br/>
<br/>
In other news: Nothing can be said hard-and-fast about character death in and of itself, the fictional event.  The systematic and social framing can turn it into any sort of form you want.  Thus, we should be careful to identify whether we're talking about death in terms D&amp;D-like games with strong player/character identification or in terms of pervy-little-indie games, where really, yeah, anything is possible if you've massaged the rules into the right form.<br/>

<p>Ah, OK.</p>
<p>Here are my actual feelings on the subject: Protagonist death is a really excellent element of stories. I love it. I love seeing my dude in a pool of his own blood for reasons that are good or bad, but never meaningless. Games where death is ostensibly on the line, but really isn't (usually by GM fiat) are deeply unsatisfying to me. Similarly, games where death usually isn't on the line, but then suddenly is (like D&amp;D, played for story, rather than strategic, purposes), are also deeply irritating.</p>
<p>It's why I love Dogs in the Vineyard so much: there's a fair amount of protagonist death, and you know when you're risking it, and you know why. Players will almost always go for a nonviolent solution, but the GM's job is to push to see how far they'll go. It makes for a very gnarly situation.</p>
<p>I think that the sadness you talk about is <em>good</em>. But! If it results in ill-will, that's terrible, a social disaster. I suggest that that has to do with the abuse of power inherent in the rules vis-ÃƒÂ¡-vis the GM. In Dogs (I'm GMing a game right now, so it's at the top of my mind), my job is to hit as hard as I can, but since I'm not in charge of the rules, I can't cheat any more than anyone else can. And since I pretty much have to play my best dice, I can feel free to give advice to the players ("I'm just gonna see with this 15, but if you raise a 16, I have to use my 9 and my raise will be lower." or "Give! He's gonna shoot you down! Don't let me use these big dice!"), since I can play just as hard as I'm required and still show sympathy in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>I guess I know the kind of turtling you're talking about. I had a player last week at a game night who was new to Dogs who wanted to do that kind of thing ("I'm out for vengeance against my sister's demonic killer. I care about no one else.). The Dogs rules really encourage playing a whole character, though. He got into it when he started realizing that after getting into the gnarl of the situation. So I totally agree with you now that I see what you're talking about: he was going to have to risk death for something, and he had to decide what it was, so it drew him out.</p>
<p>So here's my pervy-narr word on it: the problems you're addressing are not confonted in the Shadowrun rules, though they are in Dogs (I'm not saying they're abstractly addressable; I'm saying that Dogs in the Vineyard is a deeply excellent game about violence and its motivations, denial, and consequences). Death is often risked, sometimes achieved, and very tense. In fact, nonviolent solutions are foregone only reluctantly because the blood will flow freely once they're abandoned. At the same time, it is not subject to GM whim, but rather GM luck and decision making, just like everyone else. That means that if a protag dies, it's fair, it's meaningful, and even a close call gives everyone pause and they consider the consequences of violence.</p>
<p>(dodging a crosspostfest)</p>
<p>Ben, yeah, you're right. Within the narrow context of Shadowrun, Rolemaster, etc., this is a problem. Between the Cons mentioned and the Murphy's Rules kind of issues Rob mentions in his asterix, though, I'm not sure it's the right kind of place to look for what he wants.</p>
<p>Which brings me to this quesiton:<br/>
Rob, what are you hoping to do with the game as a whole (other than risk PC's lives)? (Also, you've got me thinking about character identification. That's an interesting issue.)</p>

                            Oh, god yes.  Dogs, and many other games of a narrative bent, give tools to do great things with death.  In the world where Dogs was as big and D&amp;D (so nice to dream) this would be an entirely different question.<br/>
<br/>
It's literally been over a decade since I've done a game where death is something that might happen in an unplanned fashion (such as from a fight), so in going old school, I'm pursuing three goals:<br/>
<br/>
1) Nostalgia.  Maybe they were dysfunctional in some way, but dammit, I had a lot of _fun_ with some of the older games of my youth.  It's a territory I left a long time ago, and I find myself wondering if I can return with the things I've learned elsewhere, and make them even better.<br/>
<br/>
2) To challenge myself.  Crunch and lethality can go horribly wrong if I also want to make a compelling, character-driven story, so pulling this off is definitely a way to stretch myself. Shadowrun doesn't give me much of a net, narratively speaking, so trying to get the game I want out of it will either be an awesome juggling display if it's good or trying to drive a nail with a screwdriver if it's bad.<br/>
<br/>
3) Some of my thematic goals are perhaps better suited to a horror game, with tension coming directly from the palpable threat to the characters.  There's a certain cheap thrill-ride element to that, but it can be a fun thrill ride.  To some extent, it's putting my money where my mouth is when I say that the tone of the game is that life is cheap and dangerous. Meaningless death is a meaning of its own, at least that's the hope.<br/>
<br/>
Picking players for this particular jaunt was an interesting challenge, to say the least.<br/>

<em>So players and designers: what do you like or dislike about character death (or just removal from the game)? When designing a game, what makes you decide on death vs. not death?</em><br/><br/>I usually don't design for death.  In <em>FLFS</em>, there is literally no way for any character to die, <em>even if you want to</em>, because there's always the possibility of somebody coming back in a later session.  This parallels lots of period literature, where ostensible deaths turn out to be misunderstandings or fakes, and the supposedly-dead folks turn up as plot twists.  Players can certainly <em>abandon</em> characters, even after they ostensibly die (blown out into the vaccum of spaaaace!), but there's nothing stopping them from picking the character back up later, or the GM from bringing said character back as an NPC (I woke up to the sound of a mad scientist gleefully clapping his hands, and found myself in a hollowed-out asteroid...).<br/><br/>There are death rules in <em>Agora</em>, but I very well may take them out since they're tacked on and don't do anything really interesting.  The only glimmer of possibility is promoting one of your lieutenants to a more leadery position, which I'm thinking as I write this that that ought to be the entire mechanic right there.<br/><br/>One thing that I think is important to point out is that games often bind player authority tools (ie, stats and resources) to the character, and the only way to affect the fiction is through the character.  Further, a lot of games mark the progress of the game on the character through XP, and you can look at the entire game as the process of building up and investing in the character.  In games like these, death is really tricky to incorporate without making it gruelingly punishing.  Even <em>Dogs</em> which lets you keep all your dice, just reassign them to new stats, is taking away the character that you invested your interest in over howevermany sessions you've played.  On the other hand, games like PTA or Capes where player authority tools are almost completely divorced from the character can feature death with almost gleeful abandon; killing of a character loses the player nothing, since the focus is less on characters and more on other things (the series for PTA, the players for Capes).<br/><br/><em> When in play have you had character death that was just kind of dull and unsatisfying? When was it awesome?</em><br/><br/>When I was 14, my brother and I were playing <em>Teenaged Mutant Ninja Turtles</em>, specifically <em>Mutants Down Under</em>.  We were flying zeppelins, and for some reason we decided to pit our characters against each other.  I fired a missile at his zeppelin, scored a critical, and hit the crew compartment.  Forever after, I kept reminding him that I had killed his character <em>with a missile to the face</em>.  Which I actually felt pretty bad about.<br/><br/>I don't think I've ever had an awesome character death (which may color the views I expressed above), but from a narrative framework, the noble death has always seemed like punking out to me, <em>especially</em> the revolutionaries who die for their cause of totally turning the world on its ear.  Sure, they'll die to screw everything up, but what they won't do is live through the havoc that they've wreaked.                        </div>

                            Related to Rob is saying about old-school games, and nostalgia...<br/>
<br/>
One interesting thing I have found in modern setting games with high likelihood of random lethality like Shadowrun (I gm'ed that for years) is that the players will often plan far, far more than they do in other games.  That is, if I say, as the GM through Mr. Johnson, "Your job is to steal the plans for the new McGuffin from Big Nippon Corp HQ", the players will spend a lot of time planning out the job, in order to minimize, as much as possible, the random elements (like that Machine Gun emplacement you didn't notice, or the razored mercs they brought in at the last 2nd) that are liable to get your character killed.  The goal of the players is always to be the ambushers, not the ambushees; to be the people perpetrating massive violence, and not on the receiving end.  <br/>
<br/>
This is quite different from both D&amp;D style fantasy games (where the players rarely have the ability to aquire the information in order to plan, and where the characters (at least at higher levels) are almost immune to death simply through bad luck) and narrativist games (where character death is almost always the result of choice).   In games like these, regardless of how long you have been playing standing in the wrong place when the grenade goes off will still kill your character, period.  (I think their are similarities between this and the Riddle of Steel, but that is another thread).<br/>
<br/>
Now, for some, this is boring as all get out.  Spending two hours of game time in surveillance, talking over methods of entry, who will go first and second, how much ammo to bring, etc. is just about as dead dull as you can get for some people.  This is because it is incredibly non-narrative.   You don't see Frank Sinatra and Peter Lawford slaving over plans of the Los Vegas casinos figuring out the plan to steal all that money in "Ocean's 11", you just see them present it, complete, and then execute it.    It is also not character simulationism either; in my experience, almost all of this planning takes place "out of charater" on a player to player level.  Very little, if any, "role-playing" occurs during this planning.  Its enough to make some players stand up, slam their Coke cans down on the table, and yell "Enough talking, lets get to the action!" <br/>
<br/>
However, there is an enjoyment to this kind of play for many (myself included), and its totally gamist, not narrative.  The enjoyment is in anticipating the problems, working through the possibilities, and coming up with a good way to do the job.  As Col. Smith used to say; "I love it when a plan comes together!"  <br/>
<br/>
An advantage to this kind of play with regards to character death is that, while it can happen, it almost always happens near the end of the session, when the plan is being executed, bullets are flying, etc., so that an individual player is usually not left characterless for that long.  Also, at least in the games I ran of Shadowrun, the players had a lot of control over the level of risk their characters were going to face, through the planning process. <br/>
<br/>
Its something you have to be in the right mind set for to enjoy, no doubt about it.  Its not "compelling, character-driven story" but if you are in the mood, it can be a regular riot.                        </div>

                            I tend to relate the presence of rules for character death to the hazards of the roles the characters will be assumed to be in.  Sure, in ??Dogs?? character death makes plenty of sense.  But what if the game was Mormon teenagers in the modern day?  Apart from getting run over on their bikes (and given that they _always_ wear helmets, death seems unlikely) those roles aren't as hazardous.<br/>
<br/>
Frankly, in 150-300 pages, you only have room for so many mechanics.  If you treat death explicitly, it hard for it not to be a significant part of the game.  Which means it makes sense in games where sudden death is a constant possibility.  Like "adventurers," or cops, or soldiers.  But not so much for tax auditors or actors.<br/>
<br/>
And there's also the significant observation that death mechanics do not have to be sudden.  There's a big difference between Prof. Funkenfold getting eaten by ghouls in CoC(Call of Cthulhu) and, say, the way death is treated in ??Six Feet Under.??  Not to give too much away.                        </div>

                            To be serious for a moment, I did want to try writing a game where character death can occur only once per player, because you only get one shot at making a character -- so "death" means you cannot play the game anymore. Not with a new character, not with a new group, never.<br/>

The game setting itself would be akin to "Heat" or "Ronin."                        </div>

<b><i>If protag death means that a player loses the ability to play, death is a way of shutting down a player, and turtling is defensive.</i></b><br/><br/>I've been thinking about a game where character death doesn't equal the player being refused input.  You could have a really cool horror game which starts out GMless and when your PC dies, you get GMlike powers over the story.  Like how in the board game Betrayal at the House on the Hill, the players start out working together, but then one begins controlling the monsters and opposing the other players.<br/><br/>Actually, with how most bad horror stories work, the person who lives longest is often the person with the least special forces training/handgun skill/knowledge of the campground's secret history/reason to actually have a chance of survival.  So perhaps you spend your character's survivability as a resource to establish facts in the game.  And taking damage gives you fact tokens, as well.  When your character dies, you get a big pool of tokens to establish facts and control over the nasty monsters.                        </div>

<code><br/>Larry<br/><br/>Marcie, get out of here! You're Dead! You don't exist any more!</code><br/><br/>It's time for you to learn the <i>real</i> magic Larry...  :P<br/><br/>Back on topic...<br/><br/>Awesome character deaths...  I've had a few.  Most have been in one system:<br/><br/>In a LARP system I play in called GUNFEST  I tend to die all the time.  Here's the probable reason:  character death is entirely in the hands of the player. You decide when and if your character dies.  So it means you can go out in pretty much anyway you like.  And as the game is basically about recreating every big dumb action movie ever made  (hence the name) dying spectacularly is definitely part of the feel of things.  I've sacrificed my life to save my buddies, I've shot myself in the head, I've had nano-bots eat my insides and my torso explode (The gore effects for that were cool!)  <br/><br/>I've died loads in that system, and some of the deaths have been some of my great roleplaying moments.  There's nothing like charging a horde of Zombies single handedly, screaming to your mates  "RUN!  RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!!!" and then being ripped to pieces and eaten.  (I was terrified, I really was.  The Zombies were made up extremely well, and played it perfectly. It was midnight in the woods, nothing around for miles.  The Zombies swarmed me and I fought valiantly, but was overwhelmed.  The ref was standing by with a bucket of blood and gore effects which, as the Zombies ate me, were splattered all over me, giving the horrible impression that my guts really were being ripped out.  It ruled.  It was the closest I'll get to actually being in Dawn of the Dead.)<br/><br/>The reason is that 1) the player can control how it happens, which means you only die if as the player you feel it works for you.   and 2) you immediately make a new character and just slot straight back into the action (or play an NPC for a while if you feel like it)  So you don't miss out by dying.<br/><br/>The game is pure pure Sim.  No theme is really possible, nor are there any real gamist challenge aspects to it.  (hell, there's nothing you can lose unless you want to)  The fun is simply in the interactive enactment of a movie genre coupled with immersive character roleplay.  So you don't really lose much by dying and coming back as someone new, as those aspects continue.  The only thing you lose is any IC ties or plot you may have developed.  And if they mean that much to you, you can just not die.<br/><br/>Rock!<br/><br/>Anyway, after all that I guess my point is that one way character death can be made satisfying is to leave control of it solely in the hands of the player.<br/><br/>Drew                        </div>

<p>Mr. Teapot (if that <em>is</em> your real name), there are already a couple of games that don't equate character well-being to player input. The Mountain Witch, Shock:, Prime Time Adventures (depending on the color of the show), Dogs in the Vineyard (it's not confronted explicitly, but it could be read that way, and it would work). I can't remember how With Great Power... does it.</p>

                            What do you like or dislike about character death (or just removal from the game)?<br/>
<br/>
  Depends on the game. If you can ame a char in 5-10 mins, then character death is just a nuisance. If emotional investment into a char is minimal (as in D&amp;D), then character death is just a fact of life. BUT, as these factors change, character death becomes an serious issue. That's my opinion, if it takes an hour to make a char, it should take at least an hour of play time to kill them, lol<br/>
<br/>
    When designing a game, what makes you decide on death vs. not death?<br/>
<br/>
  I try and set it up so that death is not the result of a bad roll and instead the result of a character's decision. And give the players a luck mechanic so that they can sway things in their favor when it matters to them.<br/>
<br/>
    When in play have you had character death that was just kind of dull and unsatisfying? When was it awesome?<br/>
<br/>
  Its never been awesome and I actually had to stop the game and console a player for about 20 minutes because they wouldn't stop crying. I suppose that a good death scene/dying curse can make it all worth while, but if you can get a game running for any amount of time, the whole group gets attached to their characters, you know?<br/>

                            How about...<br/>
<br/>
If instead of "playing" your character(s), everything up to and including your character's death is part of the chargen process? Why even change gameplay modes?<br/>
<br/>
Or pull a Memento and roll up your character's death, and work backwards. (Snowball sort of does this.)<br/>

<p>You cry when a character you like dies in a book or movie, too.</p>
<p>Here's what I think: if the characters are protagonists Ã¢â‚¬â€ that is, they're the decision makers and moral cruces of the story, their death can be deeply meaningful. The rules had just better make sure you get a damn good chance to make that statement.</p>

This really sounds like taking it too seriously to me.<br/><br/>When people get so attached to their characters that character death is actually upsetting to them, for me, that detracts from the game. It makes you shy away from killing characters, because you know you'd upset someone; and that robs you of a valuable option in the story.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

<i>When people get so attached to their characters that character death is actually upsetting to them, for me, that detracts from the game. It makes you shy away from killing characters, because you know you'd upset someone; and that robs you of a valuable option in the story</i><br/><br/>One question is the crying due to attachment to the character, or due to a feeling of exclusion? In most of my play experience, having your character die meant you were excluded from the rest of the game session. I think it would be comparable to being (somewhat) randomly told at a party you have to go sit in a corner and not talk (and no one will talk to you). (Actually, that's exactly the problem I have with the Mafia game we occaisionally play in our church youth group - when you get voted out, you basically spend the rest of the hour not having any input - though sometimes watching can be fun, but if you really wanted to be active rather than watching, your out of luck [and I think that's different from chosing to go to a movie or lecture, where you don't get to actively participate]).<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>

If your guy dies in D&amp;D, I don't consider it a rules problem - it's a tactical wargame at heart, so these things happen.  If you then sit on your thumbs for the next 2 hours because the GM can't even offer you an NPC to play, or find a way for you to bring in someone new, I consider that a social breakdown of the full-bore go fuck yourself variety.<br/>
<br/>
Something like Mafia, though?  Bad rules _and_ bad socialization, yeah.  <br/>
<br/>
So, end of the day, I think the issue of the value/utility/impact of death is still a good one, but in cases where death equates to exclusion, i think we've moved past rules and into the land of the asinine social contract.  <br/>

                            On the rules vs. social problem: for some games, there is still a rules problem if chargen takes long enough that bringing in a new PC is not viable within the session (and especially if creating a PC requires some GM attention - which you may not get, though that's a social problem). Running an NPC may be an option, but that may be a rules problem in an advancement based game.<br/>
<br/>
I don't think I've ever played a D&amp;D style tactical game where a player whose PC died (or even just got knocked out) didn't sit on his thumbs for the rest of the session. I'm not sure I've done a whole lot better myself. Partly this is fundamentally a problem with tactical games (and it can be a problem with board games also).<br/>
<br/>
There are other things that can leave you sitting on your thumbs: getting knocked out, getting captured, splitting the party are some.<br/>
<br/>
And our modern, indie games, don't necessarily completely resolve the problem. Get your Dogs PC killed in the first conflict of the evening, and you're in the same situation. Of course kibitzing is more encouraged in Dogs than old school D&amp;D. Of ocurse at least in Dogs the death doesn't happen so randomly, though it could still arise from not understanding the rules (not realizing the threat of 3d10 fallout, or worse, not realizing that when your Body is 2d6 and you take d8 fallout, there's a significant chance of dying).<br/>
<br/>
But I'm not sure I'd characterize the D&amp;D problem as a deep rules flaw. It's a situation that's really tricky to deal with, and Rob is probably right, ultimately it's a social flaw. For example, one could quit the D&amp;D session after finishing the combat a PC died in. Then the player will have time to create a new PC before the next session. Or everyone could create a backup PC (of course if you get that one killed also...). Perhaps it's a deep rules flaw if your system can have combats that take many hours to run (I've had a Cold Iron combat take like 5 or 6 hours to resolve), but some of those really long combats are also somehow worth it (I also once ran a D&amp;D session where I just filled the table with monsters and the PCs just went on a rampage until they were all dead, several hours later, it was a blast - but it would have sucked had a PC died in the first few minutes).<br/>

<p>Rob, I'm saying that the rules enforce that kind of assininnery. If we're playing D&amp;D and I don't get to play while my friends play for another three hours because of a bad tactical or strategic decision, that's crap. Now, if we've got a bunch of characters to play, say, so I can play someone as soon as I die, that's fine. But that's not in the rules. In that, I agree with Frank. His recommendation that you quit the game for chargen wouldn't be be acceptable to me, for certain.</p>
<p>In Dogs, it'll take no more than 20 minutes to come up with a new character. It's not a perfect situation, but it's much better than the problem would be in GURPS or D&amp;D.</p>
<p>Here's what I'd want from a game like D&amp;D: I'd want to know when I've lost so I can play again. I don't want to be in this situation where I'm competing with my comrades and against the GM so we're seeing who can lose last. That's the kind of conflict of interest rule that sets up social assininnery. That's like an office job where you're all competing for the best cubicle.</p>
<p>So, let's say our game of D&amp;D has four players and twelve characters. You choose the ones you want to use comunally. Each of them has values for the upcoming dungeon. Everyone can use them and use them up. When it gets down to the last guy, everyone's still got input. The GM sets up the dungeon according to strict CR rules and no fudging is allowed. That could be a fun game. Character death would mean a loss of resources, but not a loss of play except when your team Ã¢â‚¬â€ the PCs Ã¢â‚¬â€ lose the game (which has to be a viable outcome for Gamist play).</p>

<p><i>I do find in-game character suicide (not self-sacrifice or seppuku) kinda disturbing. What kinda game are you playing?</i><br/><br/><br/>The first was Aeon Trinity.

We stopped playing and he explained his boredom. I let him make up a new character.<br/><br/><br/>Second was Orpheus, but since players can be ghosts it wasn't too big a deal. The player wanted to make a statement about how living was holding his character back. He was more powerful as a spirit than in a body.

I guess with some experience this may be true. So far, I don't think I've seen less than an hour.<br/>
<br/>
Interesting thoughts on troupe D&amp;D play. I wonder how much more you'd have to formalize the rules for the GM because the primary gamist competition is now much more likely to be solidly between the player team and the GM, though within the team there could still be some gamist posturing. I wonder if this would push the game more firmly into wargame territory.<br/>

                            PC suicide when a player is bored of his character is something I have seen a lot. The worst case was an 11 year old player.<br/>
<br/>
I've also seen (as recently as last night), PC suicide not from boredom of character, self sacrifice, but just plain indifference (or misunderstanding) of odds. Hmm, there's been two such cases in my RuneQuest campaign now. <br/>
<br/>
The first was definitely a misunderstanding as a PC, down to 4 POW in spirit combat continued fighting "because they can't take me out in one blow," not considering that the opposing spirit would actually get TWO blows before he could escape, which it subsequently did 3 and 1 POW damage on...<br/>
<br/>
Last nights was more of an indifference to odds when the newtling swam up a stream by himself, encountered a raft (with strong hints of it being a smuggler), decided to try and over turn it, didn't flee immediately upon hearing a whistle from the rafter and approaching hoofbeats... Eventually the smugglers had newtling tail stew for dinner...<br/>

<p>Yeah, Frank, I'm assuming that you've done it a few times. Writing down the character should take about 5 minutes (including the bonus goodies you get for dying), initiation about 15. Still, not perfect. Not prohibitive, but not perfect.</p>
<p>But it takes hours to do it in GURPS, even if you know it. I think it's similar in D&amp;D.</p>

                            Hnh.  I think the point of difference is that I tend to expect creating a new character to take under 20 minutes with almost any system, including D&amp;D (at least within a certian level range).  Hero (and maybe GURPs) are probably exceptions, but I admit, there is a direct correlation between how likely I am to play/run a game and how much of a pain in the ass chargen is.<br/>
<br/>
That said, I will totally buy the idea that the extent to which the rules makes recovery from death a pain in the ass (beyond a certain minimum to give it some weight)  is a rules problem.  Where the specific sliders fall is probably somewhat more idiosyncratic.<br/>

                            With experience, I expect most games can support 20 minute chargen.<br/>
<br/>
Another problem is when the replacement character can be brought in. Obviously a tactical batlte lasting 3 hours of playtime presents a challenge (especially since it may not yet be sure your PC IS dead). Even without a battle, it's not uncommon for it to take most of a session before a new PC can be brought in. And I was involved in a discussion on Monte Cook's boards about a campaign where the PCs were travelling to another plane, and it might be several sessions before a new PC could be brought in depending on how strict the GM wanted to be about causality and logic.<br/>

<div class="Message">
<p>Josh, I probably could have generated a 100 point albino disembodied brain with odious personal habits in 20 minutes when I was playing GURPS a lot. But that guy probably represents a significant loss of resources. Do you assume that your new dude has the same number of CPs as your old dude? Is there a penalty for dying?</p>
<p>That's a choice between reducing the relevance of everyone else's hard-earned CPs and a death spiral. And what about all that story you invested your old guy into?</p>
<p>The problem that I'm really addressing here, I guess, is the meaning of death. If the loss of a PC means the removal of the player's input, that means that you're actually fighting, albeit in a social situation, to get to play at all.</p>
<p>If a game doesn't have the facility to keep players playing, but does have a facility for removing their resources, that's broken rules that makes broken social situation.</p>
<p>(Incidentally, my "20 minute new Dog includes Initiation, which could tightly tie into the current story. So I estimate 5 minutes from death to rebirth. Let's say 10. Still not optimal; I want to write down "I'm the dude that shot my old character" and go from there. Shock: lets you do that, but it assumes that your character has died for a very good reason.)</p>
<p>Edit: I think the key here is separating player from character resources. In Dogs, you <em>get</em> resources for dying, for instance. In Prime Time Adventures, everyone's character has the same number of resources and the <em>players</em> get XP. Imagine the D&amp;D collective play I described above where you got the XP that each character would get, but you distribute it to the characters as the team sees fit. You can save up XP to buy new comrades at the Tavern at the level you can afford. The XP doesn't go away, even under TPK; the <em>players</em> have it. I realize this is a big hack and the XP might not come out right. It would take some playtesting: When a character dies, do you get back their XP or not? Maybe the XP bank loses the equivalent of one level of the  dead character's? Maybe XP, once invested can't be regained? I dunno. But the point is to give the players input into the game with the mechanics in such a way that all rewards are to the players, and detriments are in Gamist terms: "We failed this mission, so we didn't get the 20000 XP we needed to get the Wizard we needed, so we need to do something else. Let's recruit an assassin gnome this time." The GM looks at the party as it exists, makes a legal adventure, and they're off again, with the PCs matching abilities to the GM.</p>

<p>Contrariwise, if you <em>know</em> that losing your character means the loss of player input then putting them on the line is <em>risking</em> something important to you as a player, in a way that it isn't in games where that's not the case.</p>
<p>You can make more of a statement saying "I'm willing to risk my one and only character I will ever have for this principle" than saying "I'm willing to risk one of an unendingly long case of disposable extras."</p>
<p>Rules that can have bad and unpleasant consequences are not necessarily dysfunctional unless your overarching goal is to keep everyone safe from anything bad or unpleasant.</p>

<p>But what's at stake here is your ability to actually play the game.</p>
<p>Now, let's say I've been playing Dogs for a few months with this character who really means something to me. I'm maybe getting a little turtly because I don't want to risk the dude.</p>
<p>But then something comes up. Something that really matters to me, and I'm running out of dice, and I've got to escalate to guns. That's excellent pressure, right there.</p>
<p>Let's say my guy gets shot down trying to make something right. (I've got a thing about coercion, so let's say I've staked the guy on something about slavery) That's totally worth it. Win or lose, I say something to my friends about myself, they get to see my kind of raw and actually angry at fictional events. So we get to the end, my dude's dead, let's say I didn't convince my fellow dogs to not give the slave back to his owner, but I've said something. I've effectively used my resources to say something about myself and my feelings on the subject. The rules even say that there's an appropriate time for reflection when a character dies.</p>
<p>But at the end of all that? I still get to play.</p>

<p>Yeah, but if you <em>didn't</em> then it would (to my mind) be a yet more powerful statement.</p>
<p>It doesn't mean that I want, on balance, to play that way.  I'd rather keep playing than make a powerful statement by gambling away my right to play.  But that doesn't mean it isn't a powerful statement, and it doesn't mean that a game that let you make such a statement would be inherently dysfunctional.  We've been discussing some of the ways that it could be used over in the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=781&amp;page=1#Item_34" rel="nofollow">Player Death</a> thread, and they're exciting.</p>
