We only had about forty minutes to throw down, but it was a good forty minutes, so we're going to continue.<br/><br/>I think we're a good pair for Beast Hunters.  I go absolutely batshit crazy for color-heavy combat with a lot of narrative freedom, and Wil likes to get his teeth into tightly focused mechanics -- he's a big Burning Wheel fan.<br/><br/>Playing in public was a bit weird.  The people next to us gave us some sideways glances, though I overheard that they did understand that we were playing a game.  I smiled at them, but didn't engage them further on that.  I was very conscious that my performing voice is way different than my conversational voice.  Also, strangely, the salute was, for me, more natural in public than it was in private.<br/><br/>Onto the Beast Hunters stuff:  I am the Challenger, and Wil is playing Katari, a half-softling Hunter who is socially oriented.  If anyone wants, I'll post his sheet here, but I don't want to make this post any longer. <br/><br/>Katari's mother was a mercenary, but her battle service was not the only stigma she faced when she returned home to her nadan.  At her side were a softling husband and a half-breed child.  To regain her standing, Katari's mother fought a deadly ritual combat.  She was killed, but her sister Sorkka, the chief and namesake of the nadan, was so impressed by her bravery that she allowed the husband and child to remain with the nadan.  Their lives were not easy, but neither is that of the Beast Hunter, and the constant sorrows young Katari endured prepared him well for his duty as a Hunter.<br/><br/>During character creation, it was tough to come up with cool resources.  The book isn't much help here, as there are many, many trait examples but very few resource ones.  The requirement that the resource can be taken away in a challenge is a difficult constraint to work around.<br/><br/>Wil chose a Pifnir beast hunt for his first adventure -- a 25/5 adventure -- but we didn't get anywhere near the beast.  In 40 minutes of play, I spent nine adversity points.  <br/><br/>Two of them were to challenge Katari's access to Chief Sorkka, who was suffering from a mysterious illness and sequestered in her tent.  Katari's rival Anqhela -- the very warrior who killed Katari's mother twenty years ago -- barred Katari's way into the tent.  I gave at the Elaboration stage here, because I sensed that I wasn't getting a lot out of this conflict.  I see the formal negotiation phase as kind of a trial run for a conflict.  If there's no energy in the negotiation, there likely won't be any in the conflict phase.  Plus, a sneaky Challenger can goad the Hunter into preactivating something during Elaboration and then give on the Complication phase -- this prevents the Hunter from preactivating that trait at any other time in the adventure.<br/><br/>Our second, seven-point conflict went through Complication and then onto Resolution.  The conflict was a social one, to drive away the malign spirit that was tormenting Sorkka.  I statted up the spirit on the fly, giving it a +4 Lingering SD trait and a +2 Convulsions SO resource. (I'm kinda proud of the Convulsions.)  <br/><br/>Lots of fun stuff happened during resolution.  I'll share a couple highlights:<br/><br/>Early on, the spirit forced Sorkka to tear her own hair out (as an offensive maneuver). Katari, in response, calmly directed an attending wise woman to comb Sorkka's hair with a silver comb. <br/><br/>My favorite bit came when Wil purchased a special effect to find out the identity of the spirit.  I gave him a low price because I wanted him to know that the spirit was that of his mother, and that she had been twisted and withered by twenty years in the underworld.  I'm not sure whether Wil had a notion of who the spirit was, or if he was just tossing me an opportunity to narrate.  However it came about, that special effect gave an energy bump to the game.  The mother spirit started tossing heavy mother guilt at poor Katari -- wishing he hadn't been born, etc.  <br/><br/>In the end, the hateful spirit was driven out, but Katari took a heavy social wound.  His enemies are still in the nadan, and they too know the identity of the spirit...and if the mother is evil, how can the son be otherwise?<br/><br/>One rules wobble: we weren't sure whether declaring the special effect consumed a turn or not.  We assumed so, but we couldn't find a citation in the book to be sure about that.<br/><br/>BH performed as promised for us.  We'll play it down in the food court some more, and keep posting here if people are digging the AP.

Awesome <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I love what you did with the special effect.  It does in fact not count as an action to define a special effect, only to achieve it.  The text says that after the cost is determined, "A player can <span style="text-decoration: underline;">now</span> spend the determined amount to achieve the effect."   There are restrictions on how soon after you introduce it you can achieve it for the person who determined the cost.  The idea here is that the player who thinks of the effect should sometimes be able to achieve it right away, if that's okay with the other player (who can set the cost appropriately), and the restriction on time for the cost-setting player is so that that player can't just make sure they set the cost at a point where they're sure to be the one achieving the goal right afterwards.<br/><br/>I'm definitely looking forward to hearing more <img alt="=)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title="=)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_82578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82578/#Comment_82578" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-21T12:27:31+00:00" title="July 21, 2007 12:27PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here is Kitari:<br/><br/>Initiative: M2, P2, S3<br/><br/>Traits<br/><br/>+2 PO A cool head when attacked<br/>+2 MO Lore of Beasts<br/>+1 MO Clever as a woman<br/>+1 MO Anqhela killed my mother, she will pay<br/>+3 SO I sing the songs of my people<br/><br/>+2 PD The beatings made me stronger<br/>+1 PD I ran beside the horses<br/>+3 MD My father taught me of a wider world<br/>+2 SD Beloved of the Spirit Stone<br/>+1 SD A traitors son must have a thick skin<br/><br/>Resources<br/><br/>+2 PO My mother's Sword<br/>+3 SO My father's Mbira<br/>+1 SO Bard's staff<br/>+1 PD The armor I took from D'Humka<br/>+2 MD Fragment of the Spirit Stone<br/>+1 SD My aunt is the chief of the Sorkka                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_82594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rafial" title="rafial"><img alt="rafial" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rafial">rafial</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82594/#Comment_82594" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-21T23:48:48+00:00" title="July 21, 2007 11:48PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnzo</cite><br/>Playing in public was a bit weird.

No, I didn't know if you had an agenda for the spirit, or what it was, but I wanted the conflict to be more than just a "you drive out the spirit."  I wanted there to be a reason.  So that's why I bought the effect.  And yeah, as soon as you dropped "I'm your mom" on me, it was like a nitrous pack for my engagement.<br/><br/>For those following along at home, the spirit of my mother now resides in my bard's staff.

Once you've got your relevant traits lit up, its all roll, roll, roll till you are done.   The leverage you do have, and where I do see challenge, is the ability to bypass the dice by wowing the other guy with cleverness or coolness of your solutions to the problem currently being presented to your in the narrative.  So having "cool story" is essential, because if the players are not buying into and being engaged by the described situation, there's absolutely no challenge to be had.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_83320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83320/#Comment_83320" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-25T14:29:28+00:00" title="July 25, 2007  2:29PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm hearing more more and about gamers getting together for their lunch hours to game and the idea intrigues the hell out of me.<br/><br/>I'd love to hear more about this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83504">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83504/#Comment_83504" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-26T13:34:18+00:00" title="July 26, 2007  1:34PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 26, 2007 2:43PM by johnzo.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wil and I Beast Lunched again today.  <br/><br/>Kitari, accompanied by his father, the tribal goat Aqhiban, set off in search of the Pifnir.  On their journey, Kitari discovered that the Pifnir appeared to be stealing jewelry from a nearby ruin.  He entered the ruin and discovered a collapsed sewer that the Pifnir were transiting.  <br/><br/>(Pifnir are a mindsharing species like the dogs in Vernor Vinge's <i>A Fire Upon The Deep</i>.  Our emerging lore is that they are quiet and cowardly when encountered singularly, and much bolder in their packs.)<br/><br/>Kitari declared a mental conflict to snare a single Pifnir and use its cries to lure the rest of its kind to a decisive engagement.  I used everything I could think of as an offensive maneuver without actually bringing the Pifnir onscreen: the hot sun causing Katari to sweat and leave his odor everywhere, the snake that curled up in the snare while Katari was away coating himself with mud, and the distractions of his father, who was wandering around the ruin and finding neat things that he wanted to share with Katari.<br/><br/>The Pifnir only appeared when Wil declared a strike.  He heavily wounded it, which we took to mean that he had actually snared it, but its cries were not working to lure its fellows.  We had to quit at that point for time, but we're picking it up tomorrow.  <br/><br/>At this stage I am comfortable with how BH is handling the mental challenge, although I don't know how I'd narrate it if Katari suffered incapacitating or deadly mental damage (those sharp teeth Pifnir teeth hit the brainpan, maybe?)  That's not going to happen, this is only a four-point challenge, but it's something to think about.<br/><br/>Big lesson learned from today: when you're stymied for narration, widen the time scale; step out of the moment-to-moment and move to the hour-to-hour or day-to-day.  Keeping the same pace through a challenge is a wargame artifact.  Also, look to the environment.  Narrate a hornets' nest or a snake or an allergy-provoking flower or a troublesome relative into the challenge and there ya go -- but don't start repeating yourself or you'll go stale.  Step On Up, indeed.<br/><br/>(edit: moved 'spin up into challenger mode' observation to other thread.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_83512">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rafial" title="rafial"><img alt="rafial" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rafial">rafial</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83512/#Comment_83512" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-26T13:54:45+00:00" title="July 26, 2007  1:54PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We had session two of Beast Lunchers today.

He was intercepted by his dad (Ahkiban), who wanted to come along, because he was feeling increasingly unwelcome in the tribe.  Katari told him that he was free to walk where he may, as any Chel'queri might, but he (Katari) could make no guarantees to his safety.  Katari's duties as a beast hunter outweigh his duty to his father.  Despite this Ahkiban chose to come along.  The two were then intercepted by Anqhela and her pack of bully boys, who insulted them and told them never to return to the Sorkka.  Anqhela's father took the bait, and said he'd be glad to see the last of the nadan, but Katari made it clear to Anqhela that while as a beast hunter his responsibility was to all Chel'qhueri, and not just the Sorkka, she should not think that she had seen the last of him.<br/><br/>These two challenges were resolved within the initial negotiation process.  These two encounters, plus a later interlude featuring a hornet, made us realize that there can be no pointless choices in Beast Hunters.  If the Challenger frames a situation that requires the hunter to take action, it is a challenge and must come from the adversity budget.<br/><br/>We also braved the world of mental challenges, first an attempt to track and trick a lone Pifnir that was carrying a golden bracelet, and then later, after discovering the tunnel that the Pifnir are using to enter and exit the ruins, an attempt to snare one so that its struggles and mental distress call will bring the rest of the pack.  It was a bit of challenge, especially with the snare to keep the narration around the actions in the spirit of the domain.  Johnzo made good use of the character of Ahkiban, and his attempts to "help" as a source of adversity in the narration.  Unfortunately we had to leave that conflict off in the middle due to time, but plan to finish it tomorrow, after which we'll have the final battle with the Pifnir.<br/><br/>One issue I'm currently pondering with BH is that it provides no way for the player to maneuver for situational advantage across conflicts.  Let's take the current situation with the snare.  The challenge was set up such that it exhausted the Challengers pool, which means regardless of mechanical outcome, Katari will face the fight with the beasts.  However, in the narrative space, if he wins the snare challenge, one of the pack members is immobilized, and he faces the rest on ground of his choosing, while if the snare fails, the lone Pifnir escapes, he pursues it, and encounters the pack on perhaps less favorable terms.  Yet no mechanical advantage or disadvantage accrues either way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83517">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83517/#Comment_83517" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-26T14:08:35+00:00" title="July 26, 2007  2:08PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: rafial</cite>Yet no mechanical advantage or disadvantage accrues either way.</blockquote>\nIf the challenge to take down the pack turns out to be a Mental or Social one, then Katari's wounds will carry forward, so those could potentially be a carry-forward disadvantage.<br/><br/>But yeah, there's no way for Katari to carry forward an advantage gained from earlier challenges.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_83519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83519/#Comment_83519" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-26T14:17:17+00:00" title="July 26, 2007  2:17PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lots of cool stuff here.

The snare was successful, but the following physical challenge versus the Pifnir pack was nip and tuck.  It turned into a running battle, ranging from ruins to forest to swamp, with Akhiban being imperiled, and Katari having to come to his rescue.  Johnzo got a good whack at me early on, with a Heavy wound, but fortunately his dice went cold shortly after that, giving me a chance.  I was -1 in both offense and defense compared to the Pifnir, which meant I had to work for my advantage points.<br/><br/>We looked briefly over the Karma rules, but didn't wind up doing anything to account for an advantage stemming from the snare challenge.<br/><br/>Katari was a little battered at the end of the adventure with heavy wounds in all categories, plus a medium in physical. The fact that the major challenges had spread out pretty evenly across the three domains prevented attrition from being a problem though.<br/><br/>All in all, a good first adventure.  For the future, we plan to follow up with non-beast hunt that deals with the spirit of my mother that now resides within my bard staff.

His name was Mazu, but he is now known as Voss.<br/><br/>Mazu was once a bold young warrior of the Yoppa nadan.  As a youth he learned all the tribal secrets -- the swaying war-dance of the serpent, the throaty and paralyzing battle-roar, the night eyes of the owl.  He made good use of these secrets, bringing many gifts of plundered steel and jewels to his people.  In his fifteenth summer he was taken as a third husband by Great Yoppa, the wisest and most exalted woman of the nadan.  His potence eclipsed that of all her other husbands, and he gave her two daughters and a son in the next three years.<br/><br/>But as quickly as he ascended, he fell.  He had plundered more than gold from the softlings.  He also took their perfumes and their strange dream-oils and lore-dust, which he poured out on the rocks in the steam chamber.  Warriors of good reputation began to question his will in battle.  One day, as he slept through his watch, softling slavers kidnapped ten Yoppa laundrymen from their riverbank.<br/><br/>For this transgression, Mazu was condemned to die by the Great Yoppa, but before she could impose her justice, he fled the nadan. His punishment thus fell upon his children.  They were turned out of Great Yoppa's encampment and forced to dine on the garbage of the tribe.  They can only return to honor if they kill Mazu, and his two eldest daughters have sworn to do just that.  His youngest son, born after his flight, yearns to know his father, though.<br/><br/>For fifteen years, Mazu lived as a hermit in the Berengad, avoiding all contact.  Gradually his fighting powers returned to him.  He sought danger recklessly, striving to prove that he was no coward, but his conscience would not be silenced.  In despair, he tried to commit suicide in the smouldering brimstone pits of Vossa.  His warriorly nature trumped his despair and he dragged himself free of the pits -- burned to the point of unrecognizability, but alive.<br/><br/>Only the Spirit Stone can reshape a soul, and in Mazu it recognized one who could be molded.  Mazu heard its call and dragged himself to it.  The elder Beast Hunters tried him sorely.  They starved him, flogged him, whispered torments in his ears, abandoned him in the cold, and sent him on a hopeless quest to retrieve the Swords of Fire and Lightning from underneath the Morgoth glacier.  Nothing they did shook him.  In the end, the Spirit Stone was greatly impressed, and it gave him a new name.  He was now Voss, named after the sulfurous pits where his despair was burned away.<br/><br/>Initiative: M1 P4 S2<br/><br/>Traits:<br/><br/>PO+3 Secret Defender<br/>PO+2 At Home In The Dark<br/>PO+1 Deafening Battle Roar<br/>MO+2 My Son Will Know His Father<br/>SO+3 Basso Profundo<br/><br/>PD+2 Reborn In Fire <br/>PD+1 Only My Daughters May Kill Me<br/>MD+1 We Survived The Winter<br/>MD+1 I Chose The Owl Claw<br/>SD+2 No One Will Recognize Me Now<br/><br/>Resources:<br/><br/>PO+3 Twin Swords Of Fire and Lightning<br/>MO+1 My Ancestors Still Believe In Me<br/>SO+2 There Is Great Nobility In My Ugliness<br/><br/>PD+2 Serpent's Battle-Dance<br/>MD+1 I Have Forgotten So Much<br/>SD+1 I Have Nothing Left To Lose                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rafial" title="rafial"><img alt="rafial" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rafial">rafial</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84378/#Comment_84378" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-31T14:43:54+00:00" title="July 31, 2007  2:43PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>SD+1 I Have Nothing Left To Lose </blockquote>\nI'm very much looking forward to denying this resource.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_84397">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rafial" title="rafial"><img alt="rafial" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rafial">rafial</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84397/#Comment_84397" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-31T16:03:58+00:00" title="July 31, 2007  4:03PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We now take a brief moment for some <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3748&amp;page=2#Item_2" rel="nofollow">cross thread pollution</a>\n<blockquote>2.

You have traits like "My Mother Didn't Let Me Watch Ninja Turtles For Feel It Would Cause Me To Be Violent" and "In My Nightmares I Am a Unicorn Ecoterrorist." A key part of the game is out-emo the other players during character creation by coming up with the traits that make the other players say "DUDE, AWESOME!!!" the loudest.</blockquote>\nI CAN HAS BEAST HUNTERS?!?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84436">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84436/#Comment_84436" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-31T18:52:38+00:00" title="July 31, 2007  6:52PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Haha. Yeah, BH is definitely an "awesome traits" game.
