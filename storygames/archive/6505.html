I'm curious what gaming path everyone took to get to where they are today.  The rivers more than the tributaries.<br/><br/>I was talking to James Jeffers the other day and he managed to avoid the White Wolf games altogether, and that fascinated me, because they were important to me and my group for almost a decade.<br/><br/>So, for me:<br/><br/>I started playing D&amp;D in 1982.  I played Erol Otus basic and expert until the new boxed edition came out and then played that until the Master boxed set came out.  Then, due to Xtian hysteria I got rid of my D&amp;D stuff and actually played Dragon Raid for a year or so.   When I was ready for real gaming again I went ahead and got AD&amp;D and played that until 1988 when a dysfunctional game caused me to give up on D&amp;D and curse its name for over a decade, until 3e came out and made me appreciate it for what it is again.<br/><br/>My second important game was Star Frontiers, in about 1983, but the cool 17-year-old kid who worked at the game store told me that Traveller was where it was at, so I immediately dropped Star Frontiers and played Traveller for years after that, but I never became cool.  There was a little bit of Star Wars played sometime in there too after it came out.<br/><br/>Next was MERP and then Stormbringer, which we played for years, and since that was BRP it led us directly into Cthulhu, which is still my favorite all-time game and something I'm always willing to play.  After that it was Shadowrun and into Vampire (where I met Ami) and a little Amber.  Then back to Cthulhu exclusively for years with all the cool Pagan Publishing and Delta Green stuff.<br/><br/>A few years ago, I ordered Dogs in the Vineyard because it looked interesting, and that opened up a whole new realm of games to play (not that I've actually played that much Dogs).<br/><br/>So, where I am now is with too many games and too little time.  I can't say that anything I mentioned wouldn't be fun to play again.  I think it's a great time to be a gamer.  <br/><br/>So, if you are so inclined, tell me how you got to where you are now.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144120">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144120/#Comment_144120" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-15T04:33:11+00:00" title="May 15, 2008  4:33AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Games I played a metric assload of:<br/><br/>White Box ---&gt; AD&amp;D ---&gt; Traveller ---&gt; The Morrow Project ---&gt; Fringeworthy/Bureau 13 ---&gt; GURPS ---&gt; FUDGE ---&gt; Age of Homebrews ---&gt; Age of Indies<br/><br/>Note the slippery slide toward madness.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144121/#Comment_144121" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-15T04:56:18+00:00" title="May 15, 2008  4:56AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Red Box D&amp;D --&gt; AD&amp;D --&gt; TMNT --&gt; Heroes Unlimited --&gt; Beyond the Supernatural --&gt; Call of Cthulhu --&gt; Rifts --&gt; Indie Games --&gt; ???                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144122">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144122/#Comment_144122" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-15T05:11:37+00:00" title="May 15, 2008  5:11AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a teenager, it was Tunnels and Trolls...Dungeons and Dragons...Golden Heroes and Star Frontiers...Toon.<br/><br/>Then a few years off.<br/><br/>Then someone got me into White Wolf Mind's Eye Theatre, which led me to run one-shot LARPs.<br/><br/>At about the same time, I picked up Paranoia XP, which I loved.

A few of my friends and I became obsessed with how one would stat something out with the HERO system from action movie heroes to Transformers to the contents of the DC Who's Who or the Guidebooks to the Marvel Universe.  I think Champions was the first game to really grab my attention.<br><br>From Vampire -&gt; L5R could very well be called -broken promises- if I was to name the era.  It was a time when I was really frustrated with my games and my gaming.  Ars Magica's vague guidelines for troupe play as each edition moved farther and farther away from what interested me in mythic Europe and Vampire's Humanity stat, Werewolf's Rage and L5R's Honor and Glory all left us wondering why these things just didn't work for us at the table.<br><br>Oddly, I think Deadlands was the most useable of the bunch but man, that original game system was busy with dice and chips and cards.<br><br>D&amp;D 3.0 and Unknown Armies were neat tweener games and worked really well out of the box.  It wasn't 3.0's fault that I was looking for Burning Wheel Revised and that wasn't it.  3.0 was the first game that I remember showing how the game worked behind the curtain.  I remember a portion of the DMG, I think, where they walk you through making your own class and what balance issues to keep in mind.  Neat stuff.  UA was a game I had a ton of fun playing and GMing at home.  I loved how the stress meters brought about character change whether you liked it or not.  It was the first game to show a mental side-effect for violence.<br><br/>Dust Devils, Sorcerer and TRoS all changed things for me.  Suddenly, games could work just out of the box and were meant to be played as written.  Fun times.<br/><br/>I feel like another big corner was turned with Dogs in the Vineyard and Burning Wheel Revised.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144268">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144268/#Comment_144268" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-15T14:46:17+00:00" title="May 15, 2008  2:46PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 15, 2008 2:51PM by Jogesh EZ.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ShaneJackson</cite>So, if you are so inclined, tell me how you got to where you are now.</blockquote>\nRed box D&amp;D, and all through the colors to Immortal (although we only really played the first three).  That led me to Dragon magazine, that led me to Palladium, specificially Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.  Then I found more people to play with besides me and my best friend, and they were playing 1st edition AD&amp;D (or actually somewhere in between 1st and 2nd, drifting quickly to 2nd edition with us newcomers who only had 2nd edition books, though I don't know if we were a factor, I didn't even know the different editions had anything different outside of the art). And discovering so many games so fast kept me in that mode, I never settled down. Although most of the time we played AD&amp;D or Palladium (TMNT, Rifts, Heroes Unlimited) but I got Ghostbusters and Cyborg Commando (it was a gift, never figured out how to play it), Torg, and Star Wars, TOON, played Champions, Paranoia, Top Secret, Marvel, and a bunch of others I know I'm forgetting.<br/><br/>Then a friend discovered Vampire (at first I dismissed it - "Blood Points instead of Hit Points? That's a sad rip off of D&amp;D!" - due to misinformation) and we eventually played it. And the whole storytelling ethos professed everything I was looking to do, so that replaced a lot of games and dominated play.  Then as the shine wore off years later, I started branching out again, Men In Black, Big Eyes, Small Mouth, Unknown Armies, and a bunch more I'm sure (along with a hell of a lot of White Wolf games, editions, and supplements), until I hit upon Sorcerer and my whole world changed, and that's pretty much were I am. Except I still don't own Sorcerer, but I've dived pretty deep into the indie games, and now have found a nice middle ground where I like to mix indie games and traditional games and play them honestly, not trying to push them to do something that they aren't designed to do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144271/#Comment_144271" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-15T14:49:06+00:00" title="May 15, 2008  2:49PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wonder if you could create an affinity/matchmaker program that judged compatibility based on shared history.

Thought that CHA stood for "Challenge," and couldn't understand why some people had really crappy scores when they were clearly badass. <br/><br/>Enter LOTS of homebrewing. Finally picked up PHB, DMG, and the awesome three-ring Monstrous Manual (and its many friends).<br/><br/>The next big deal was GURPS, especially Supers. I loved tinkering with the system. Red box came in somewhere, as well as my beloved Rules Cyclopedia. A whole game in one book! How could I resist?<br/><br/>Battlelords of the 23rd Century, RIFTS, Paranoia, Marvel and DC's games, sci-fi homebrewing that eventually resulted in Valence. <i>Planescape.</i> Magic: the Gathering sucked my money away for quite some time.<br/><br/>Werewolf was my next big impact, but it really paled when Mage showed up. I didn't 100% get the ideas behind the game for a long time, but even the surface was a hell of a lot of fun. Very deep game.<br/><br/>From there things sort of exploded when I got to college, not because I met other gamers, but just because this whole "Internet" thing showed up in force and I could read about all kinds of games. Found Amber, played that for years. Palladium Fantasy, In Nomine, Ars Magica, Vampire, BESM, L5R, Deadlands, lots of other stuff. Lots.<br/><br/>D&amp;D 3rd was a nice renaissance.<br/><br/>At some point I instituted a policy: never buy a game I could write myself. Was good policy. Has worked well so far.<br/><br/>The first indie game I actually saw was Sorcerer, but the first one I played was... maybe Donjon? It was quite a while before I actually played one.<br/><br/>And that's where I am right now. There's a lot more richness to this that escapes my feeble brain at this time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144309/#Comment_144309" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-15T17:11:51+00:00" title="May 15, 2008  5:11PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Almost my entire gaming history has been with homemade games, but here goes:<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Middle School</b><br/>\nMy first RPG (aside from a partial session of <i>Boot Hill</i> when I was like 8) was one by my friend Rowdy called <i>"Q": the Great Gathering</i> that, if memory serves, was about an ancient mystical society that had a diaspora a long time ago, and they're now regrouping in modern day because their leader has reincarnated, but the individual factions have grown so different from eachother over time that now they can't get along.  You didn't roll to hit; you rolled to see what you had the opportunity to do (I didn't recognize it as such at the time).  We played the hell out of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also played one session of V:tM, which turned me off to White Wolf entirely (and probably unfairly) because the game was completely overrun by social jockeying to see who could be the kewlest, darkest, most gothinest guy in the group--and such alpha-struggle behavior was REALLY unusual with that group of friends, so it was unpleasant.<br/>\nMe, reading through the clans:  "Hm.  Maybe I'll be a Malkavian"<br/>\nFriend:  "A Malkavian?  Whaddya wanna be a fuckin' clown for?"<br/>\nMe:  "Oh.  Um, I guess I'll be a Toreador."<br/>\nFriend:  "A fuckin' flower-sniffer?  <i>Really</i>?"<br/>\nMe:  "Oh.  Well, what are you?"<br/>\nFriend, proudly:  "Gangrel!"<br/>\n<br/>\nI tried my hand at writing several games (that whole circle of friends was doing it for a while), and the one that stuck and actually got played was called <i>Misadventures in Nowhere</i>.  It was a tactics-dominated thing about outlaws and mercenaries, with swords &amp; sorcery and also guns &amp; cars.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>High School</b><br/>\nI played nothing but Misadventures, and it gradually evolved into a grimmer, more Sim-focused thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>College</b><br/>\nPlayed some TOON!, and a short campaign of D&amp;D; (I have no clue which one).  I didn't find TOON! satisfying, and I never liked D&amp;D;'s color after I was like 12 (I kinda don't like high fantasy in general these days).  Misadventures spiralled into maximum grimness and was renamed <i>The Rustbelt</i> (and the focus shifted from outlaws to scavengerly adventurers), full-on Purist for System bloatedness and saw some mediocre play in that milieu (due to the fact that no one else cared about simulating the world) and also some rare but riveting play that I would later learn was Narrativism.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I stopped gaming altogether for quite some time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Then I found the Forge, and my head exploded.</b><br/>\nWrote a crazy experiment that threw out everything I thought I knew about RPGs and called it <i>Super Action Now!</i>, miraculously found people interested in playing in this small town where I live, and played the CRAP out of SAN!.  Also started developing a sortof supernatural Men-in-Black in the Old West called <i>Witch Trails</i>, been playing moderately.  Played <i>InSpectres</i> a few times and failed miserably as a GM, but was able to contribute well as a player.  Played <i>kill puppies for satan</i> once and had a revealing experience.  Also re-tooled <i>The Rustbelt</i> into a Nar-focused thing, played it a few times with steadily increasing success.  And that puts us up to speed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/unlikelylass" title="unlikelylass"><img alt="unlikelylass" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/danaellijohnson/SH5C2Orf01I/AAAAAAAAAFk/gbu1XwxZFyE/s144/dana-tiny.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/unlikelylass">unlikelylass</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144320/#Comment_144320" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-15T17:40:48+00:00" title="May 15, 2008  5:40PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 15, 2008 5:42PM by unlikelylass.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll do the "major investments of time" thing, not the every single thing I've ever played, which is massive, or everything I own, which is actually even larger.<br><br>The chronology is rough.<br><br>1.

I have very fond memories of a summer-long "After the Bomb" campaign. <br><br><strong>Early on</strong><br>- Marvel Superheroes<br><br><strong>Middle School</strong><br>- AD&amp;D Oriental Adventures - O.A. because I fooled my and my friends' religious parents into thinking it wasn't "Dungeons and Dragons." For a short while, anyway. Then came the ceremonial throwing away of the books.<br>- TMNT<br>- A few other games, but nothing that lasted very long. (Ghostbusters, W.E. Star Wars)<br><br><strong>... 16 years passed ...</strong><br/>... and I didn't play a single game that wasn't displayed on a computer monitor.<br/><br/>A few years ago, D&amp;D 3.5 got me back into RPGs, and I see a lot of great games that I'm itching to try. I'm hoping that, in a few years time, my genealogy will have added Call of Cthulhu and several story games such as Universalis, Agon, the Shab-Al-Hiri Roach, 1001 Nights and PTA.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144653/#Comment_144653" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-17T09:17:28+00:00" title="May 17, 2008  9:17AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 17, 2008 9:26AM by buzz.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Grade School</b><br/>A single game of blue-book Basic D&amp;D where my pal Hassan and I romped through <i>B2: Keep on the Borderlands</i>. We spontaneously invented both<br/>multiclassing and GM-less play. "Hey," I would say as I read through the book, "we should go over here where the minotaur is!"<br/><br/><b>Middle School</b><br/>AD&amp;D1e was the game of choice. Our school had a "minicourse" in D&amp;D, i.e., 45 minutes a day and a room in which to play. The supervising teacher would<br/>even give you crap if you weren't playing. "Either play some D&amp;D or else you have to go to study hall."<br/><br/>Then we discovered <i>Champions</i>, which was soon replaced with V&amp;V, since we could actually figure out how to play V&amp;V. Likewise, a lot of us owned<br/><i>Traveller</i>, but <i>Star Frontiers</i> made more sense.<br/><br/><b>High Schoo</b>l<br/>More AD&amp;D1e, now enhanced by <i>Unearthed Arcana</i>. I owned a bajillion RPGs at this point, but AD&amp;D was all we were playing.<br/><br/><b>College</b><br/>I gave up RPGs entirely... Until I broke down one day Sophomore year and joined my roommate's <i>Rolemaster</i> game. We went on to play a lot of <i>Call of<br/>Cthulhu</i>, and a little bit of <i>Champions</i> 4th edition. I still didn't really grok the latter, despite GM'ing it. All gaming stopped again Junior year,<br/>though.<br/><br/><b>The Big Break</b><br/>The next nine years or so were pretty much no RPGs at all. I got into Magic for a little bit, and bought a copy of CORPS. Mostly, though, I sold the majority of my games and was occupied with other things. I hung out on various RPG newsgroups, but like a lot of people in the '90s, I talked about RPGs despite not playing them.<br/><br/><b>D&amp;D 3.0</b><br/>I stumbled upon an article about a new edition of D&amp;D coming out. The described changes so set fire to my brain that I went out and bought the<br/>books. The new d20 engine just blew me away. I got some friends together to play D&amp;D for the first time in forever, and when that fell through, I did<br/>something unprecedented. I went out onto the Web, posted on some player-finder sites, and hooked up with total strangers in order to game.<br/>And then dId it again so I had a second D&amp;D group to play with.<br/><br/>That I was not alone in doing this, even within the groups I joined, makes me consider D&amp;D 3.0 one of the most important RPG releases ever. Heck, I<br/>organize Enworld Gamedays now, and that would never have happened if not for 3.0 (and ENWorld).<br/><br/><b>HERO</b><br/>3.0 got me buying RPGs regularly, and among them was the new 5th edition of HERO. I fell in love (again), and found yet more total strangers to<br/>regularly play HERO with.<br/><br/>Yup, three gaming groups, total.<br/><br/><b>Deep in the Game</b><br/>I was tangentially aware of the Forge during this time, but I never really connected with what it was doing. Then, somehow, I found Chris Chinn's blog,<br/>Deep in the Game. I sat and read his entire archive... twice. That led me to other "Forge diaspora" blogs, which then led me back to the Forge itself. I then read Ron's GNS essays, and my world was officially rocked.<br/><br/><b>Today</b><br/>I'm back to one regular group, and we primarily play D&amp;D, though we're on a little <i>Star Wars Saga Edition</i> detour as we wait for 4e. Otherwise, my time and money is spent on games from IPR, my main loves being <i>Burning Wheel</i> and FATE. The indies and WotC are the only people who continue to impress me.

Occaisonally successful, the moments of great gaming only served to keep us in the same vicious cycle of angsty, pointless bickering and moping games where nothing ever happened and we never even got to see the GM's story because we knew railroading was bad but we didn't know how to make anything happen any other way.<br><br><b>The Phantom Menace</b><br>D&amp;D 3!

I'd had fun before, but now I was learning how to achieve that regularly.  <br><br><b>Attack of the Clones</b><br>Savage Worlds.  This is an excellent game.  I played a year-long campaign of this, and kept finding new things to like about it.  It's elegant, simple, and practically strong-arms you into the kind of play it supports.  And yet... I was unsatisfied.  I had niggling doubts about the way I was running games.  I took my doubts to the Forge, and so began:<br><br><b>Revenge of the Sith</b><br>Moving to Japan cut me off from my normal gaming fun.  I wanted games I could introduce to new players, games I could play one-on-one with my wife.  I found indie games, and I haven't looked back.  I've played a lot of The Mountain Witch, Sorceror, and the first successful RPG I ever designed.  I can't wait to get back to New Zealand and join in with (what sounds like) a very active indie gaming scene over there.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_145252">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Forest" title="Rich Forest"><img alt="Rich Forest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2304/2385429537_23274b76cf.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Forest">Rich Forest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145252/#Comment_145252" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-21T04:00:24+00:00" title="May 21, 2008  4:00AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love stuff like this.
