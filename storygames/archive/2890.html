Please review and give feedback!<br/><br/>So, one player commented that he was disappointed that the swirl in the middle of the character sheet didn't have something to do with the mechanics in the game. I have an idea for this.<br/><br/>The 'corruption' of the Black Pool should be available to anyone willing to accept it. This allows for some nasty cool characterization. Here's how I'd do it:<br/><br/>In the center of the table, put out some black Fudge dice. These are 'helper' dice that anyone can offer someone else, roleplaying the agency of the Black Pool. Everyone should have an agreed upon mindset as to what the Black Pool offers help for. Basically, you can sway someone's actions to something the Pool would want, for the help that it gives. In tighter GM games (like this one suggests), the GM might be the only agent of the Pool.<br/><br/>When someone takes that help, they have to choose a Key or Secret to corrupt. These Keys or Secrets are now 'corrupted' and can only be cleansed during a Refresh scene. The Refresh scene, to be an act of Cleansing, must also show some act of sacrifice on the character's part. Otherwise, it works in all other ways a Refresh scene normally does. Also, a combined Heal and Counsel ability test might be able to cure the corruption.<br/><br/>If I had time, I'd come up with some Secrets and Keys that were only 'purchasable' at certain corruption levels. Finally, if all of your Keys and Secrets and corrupted, you are completely corrupted and would gain a Key of Corruption (which is automatically corrupted, and never can become uncorrupted). I haven't yet defined the Key of Corruption.<br/><br/>How does this work with y'all? Too complicated? Would this mechanically enforce 'corruption' or just provide a strategy to power game? Does it sound fun?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65559/#Comment_65559" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-26T14:08:29+00:00" title="April 26, 2007  2:08PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Corruption <i>always</i> sounds fun!<br/><br/>I don't know much about TSOY (read through it online, thought it looked cool, didn't have anyone to play it with), so I can't comment too specifically on it.

Hard to judge your implementation without actually playing, though.<br/><br/>Here's a thought, and it's the Mike Gentry Fudge Manuver: If you want, why not graft another corruption mechanic wholesale onto the game?<br/><br/>Set up how corruption works in the background. Like, you can take Corruption Coins to gain automatic +1s to our dice.  But each time you do so, roll 2d6 (yep, regular old d6es): If you roll under the amount of corruption you used, you go batshit evil or something. <br/><br/>In other words, don't be afriad to graft "non fudge dice" stylin' into the game.<br/><br/>Comes from Mike Genrty, who used Fudge to play CoC: Not satisfied with Fudge implementations of Sanity, he just lifted the whole Sanity system from CoC, wholesale, and plopped it into his Fudge game (complete with d4, d6, d8 etc san loss, a huge pool of san, etc).

It probably needs a bit of work, but there's something very awesone there.<br/><br/>We did something similar by having a "possessed" key in our game. Basically, a character accepted a parasitic relationship with an extradimensional being, which gave him the secret of possession. The demon lived by attaching itself to one of the character's keys. Every time the player got XP off that key, the demon got XP too. We role-played this as the character developing an ever greater obsession with their key (Key of the collector, as it turned out). <br/><br/>The player got some benefits for accepting the possession. First, the demon (who had some impressive knowledge skills) could help them on dice rolls. Second, the player was allowed to take a Key of Possession that gave them XP every time they did something that benefitted the demon (giving them, in essence, a double XP hit whenever they used their possessed key).<br/><br/>But there was a price. The demon had the option of corporealizing at any point. When they did so, they got to spend all the XP they'd sucked off the character. This played out as the character saving his lost love, only to have the demon jump out of his body and take her over.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65630">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex" title="Alex"><img alt="Alex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex">Alex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65630/#Comment_65630" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-26T23:56:14+00:00" title="April 26, 2007 11:56PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>In other words, don't be afriad to graft "non fudge dice" stylin' into the game.</blockquote>This was the rationale behind d20 Call of Cthulhu, too: the designers just went "Yeah, this Mythos and Sanity stuff is actually weirder if we just steal the mechanics from a different game system and use them wholesale without adapting them."

I'd like to delve further into this, and want to see if everyone agrees with my presumptions below. If so, I'll move on to a creating a better mechanical model of Corruption.<br/><br/><b>Corruption and Corruptive Possession</b><br/><br/>Corruption and corruptive possession are a two way street. Neither is accomplished without both parties benefiting and suffering. Also, corruption is relative and has to be defined on a case by case basis (although certain games may define at least portions of it at the outset).<br/><br/>First, identify both parties. The first party should be that of the Corrupted, which is usually a PC. In this case, it could be every PC, just one PC, or just one character that a player is assigned. The author feels that a PC should always be the Corrupted, but sometimes a PC needs to Corrupt an NPC. Testing will tell.<br/><br/>Next, identify the Corrupter. This can range from an actual character (a demon, a ghost, the Anti-God, a PC) to a character-like thing (a Black Pool, the Mists, the Ring). Never should Corruption be dealt by a non-character thing - it has to be anthropomorphized in some way to have these goals of benefit and suffering; otherwise you will find this as a distraction of rules instead of a mechanic for character change.<br/><br/>Third, you have to realize the Corruption Cycle.<br/><br/>3. The Corrupter* is suffering. Identify its Suffering.<br/>4. The Corrupter* contacts the Corrupted*.<br/>5. The Corrupter* offers a temporary Boon.<br/>6. The Corrupted accepts the Boon from the Corrupter.<br/>7. The Boon comes with it Suffering, but is Addictive.<br/>8. Further use of the Boon comes with it more Suffering, or lack of use of the Boon comes with it Suffering from the Addiction.<br/>9. Finally, the Corrupted either accepts the Boon permanently and has permanent Suffering, wherein the Corrupter can move on to other targets, or, the Corrupted finds some way to resist the cycle of Suffering, thus betraying the Corrupter.<br/>* - Potential<br/><br/>Example: Fellowship of the Ring<br/><br/>1. The Corrupted: Frodo<br/>2. The Corrupter: The Ring<br/>3. The Ring is Suffering to due to its separation from Sauron.<br/>4. Frodo becomes the Ringbearer.<br/>5. The Ring offers Invisibility to your foes.<br/>6. Frodo uses the Ring.<br/>7. Frodo starts becoming paranoid, and wants to use the Ring more. <br/>8. Frodo Suffers when using his Invisibility as Sauron recognizes the Ring being used. Frodo can't tell friend from foe.<br/>9. Frodo could have accepted the Ring, and become like Smeagol. However, he resisted the Ring and threw it into the belly of Mount Doom.<br/><br/>Acceptable? If so, then I think I can move on to making interesting mechanics around this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65639">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65639/#Comment_65639" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-27T04:15:52+00:00" title="April 27, 2007  4:15AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Maybe the Black Pool giveth bonus dice and also taketh - have a stack of penalty dice that corrupted people have to give away to their uncorrupted friends in play.
