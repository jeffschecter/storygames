The place has always had a "spooky" reputation, but lately activity has been on the upswing, and our heroes are investigators and locals who have banded together to deal with the issue. (Or, if they want, they can be Aliens or time agents or anyone who has stepped out of the Rift).<br/></blockquote>\nThis idea rocks. I pitched it to my daughters, and they totally started riffing on it. We live in Seattle, and they already had ideas of where they wanted the rift to be located (beneath Pioneer Square in Underground Seattle of course) and what kind of characters they'd play. When I asked what the American version of Torchwood would be called, they said "Torchwood 5 or 6." I asked them how could it be Torchwood, I mean that was started by the Queen of England. "Masons!" they said... So Masons brought Torchwood to the colonies with them, and they have secret enclaves in key cities across the nation, operating independently from the government, and only loosely supported by Torchwood proper. We're playing Mouse Guard right now, but as soon as we need a break from that, we'll be exploring the Whoniverse from our own backyard.<br/><br/>I love being a geek dad.

There are 5 suits (Seeker, Peasant, Sage, Romantic, and Adversary) and 5 roles per suit. Each role has 3-5 requirements you must complete before you can switch cards-- with the exception of conflict, which allows the winner to either change their card or change the card of their opponent, so the only way you can actually defeat the big evil dude is by changing them on a fundamental level (Like Avatar (the cartoon)!) Some of the required actions require they involve someone of a different suit.

Maybe you have to wait that long to play the sort of games we (as adults) are used to playing, but two-year-olds are delighted by the idea that their toys might have internal lives, with different sorts of relationships and opinions about how things ought to be. I've learned a lot about my toddler's favorite stuffed monster as he actively reveals the character in play \u2014 Babo likes to eat trains and cars, but not blocks, for instance, and the turtle puppet likes to eat his toes. Mommy Owl and Construction Guy are his friends. He has a nose but doesn't wear it most of the time. Generally, monsters need to take more naps than big boys (which, of course, Dante is!), and they can sleep on the couch or the big pink chair, as well as in the crib.<br/><br/>These are all things that were asserted into the fiction by a two-year-old, using the system that he's always right about Babo, and I always have to agree and encourage him to keep telling me more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_248291">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248291/#Comment_248291" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-23T10:34:21+00:00" title="December 23, 2009 10:34AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This thread is giving me all kinds of happy feelings.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248348">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell" title="John_Powell"><img alt="John_Powell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/nP846SDWNCDOK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell">John_Powell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248348/#Comment_248348" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-23T15:47:06+00:00" title="December 23, 2009  3:47PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 23, 2009 3:47PM by John_Powell.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Judd, you are an honorary geek dad!<br/><br/><a href="http://githyankidiaspora.wordpress.com/2004/10/18/monkeys-on-mars/" rel="nofollow">http://githyankidiaspora.wordpress.com/2004/10/18/monkeys-on-mars/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
