Remember that you're writing an instruction manual. So start out with a general description ("in this game, players try to win by starting scenes highlighting only their own character. There are scenes of five different types (...)"). Get to the specifics later.<br><br>2. Get someone else to read the text and ask EVERY SINGLE QUESTION they have along the way. Like "What on earth is a SuperKill? Why do people even want to use the Blubber trait?" Note those questions down in silence and restructure your text.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_73035">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick" title="Andrew Kenrick"><img alt="Andrew Kenrick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/145/415482171_321214bd7c.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick">Andrew Kenrick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73035/#Comment_73035" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-01T04:53:21+00:00" title="June  1, 2007  4:53AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            2a.

Welcome to the party, Neil.<br><br>The best advice I can give you is this: you probably have your setting and rules written down somewhere.  That is not your manuscript.  Those are <em>notes</em>.  Now that you have completed notes, you need to write the manuscript.  Before you write the manuscript, you need to plan the manuscript.<br><br>(The following will sound like 9th grade English advice on constructing an essay; it's only marginally related.  This is planning and constructing a <em>book</em>, which is way the hell more complicated.)<br/><br/>Write down a list of all the things that you'd need to explain to your intended audience*.  This is not a list of rules, although the different rules will probably be items on the list.  Then start shifting around the items on the list so they're in the order that you'd present them in.  After you think you're done, go down the list and for each item think about what other things need to be explained before that item.  Make sure they're already on the list, above that item.  Chunk the list into sections.  These sections will become chapters, but don't think of them as such yet, because you'll end up making assumptions.  Go down the list and mark off the chunks that are already there.  Now you have an outline.<br/><br/>Extra bonus: if you have the technology for it (actually any good word processor does this, these days) go through the list and use indents to indicate main topics and supporting topics.  Eventually, those become part/chapter/section/segment distinctions.  Right now, just sort of get them organized.<br/><br/>Extra extra bonus: go through the whole list and write down, in one short paragraph, what gets explained in that section.<br/><br/><strong>Payoff:</strong> You have a nice, fleshed out outline.  Now you can write <em>any section</em>, in <em>any order</em>, whichever section appeals to you when you sit down at your desk.  Tick them off as you go.  Assuming your outline is complete, you can write all the sections separately (in different word processing files) and then thread them together <em>later</em>.  Do that only after you've written the vast majority of the sections.  Then read it through yourself; you'll notice a couple bits that you left out.  Write those as sections and insert them somewhere appropriate in the outline and the compiled manuscript.  Then you will have a first draft, which you can hand to somebody else who can read it and tell you which bits don't make sense.<br/><br/>For an example of this in action, see <a href="http://wickedthought.livejournal.com" rel="nofollow">John Wick's Livejournal</a>, where he is posting the sections of <em>Houses of the Blooded</em> as he writes them.  Each of those sections, and what is covered in each section, is coming off of an outline like the one I described above.<br/><br/>This is a <em>lot</em> of work, Neil, but the trick is to plan it and chunk it out so that it never feels like a lot of work.  Whenever you sit down, you should be sitting down to write just one section -- a page or three.  You will be astounded at how quickly you tick off the items on your outline.<br/><br/>* You have an intented audience, even if you haven't identified it yet.  What kind of person do you want to get your game to?  Who do you want to play it?  That's your intended audience.  Write <em>for them</em>.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_73168">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow" title="Neil Gow"><img alt="Neil Gow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/084/nS7S5AMIXMIH0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow">Neil Gow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73168/#Comment_73168" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-01T11:13:29+00:00" title="June  1, 2007 11:13AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the replies.
