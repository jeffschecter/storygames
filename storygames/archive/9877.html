Half the screen time was spent on absurdly long-winded intertitles.<br/><br/>My thought was, what would a game be like where none of the players are allowed to communicate dialogue except through the medium of writing? They can communicate action as usual, but the only way their characters speak is by putting pen to paper or chalk to chalkboard.<br/><br/>The big questions: would you even consider playing this game, and how would it change the gameplay?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_219510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan" title="Brendan"><img alt="Brendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.xorph.com/images/miniludie.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan">Brendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219510/#Comment_219510" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-19T21:23:58+00:00" title="July 19, 2009  9:23PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would totally play this game.

(Actually, it might even work better if dialogue was free and actions had to be written...)<br/><br/>Anyway, it would at least be worth a try as a one-shot, especially if you had to mouth all the words silently with exaggerated facial expressions before you held up the board.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_219521">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219521/#Comment_219521" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-20T04:51:55+00:00" title="July 20, 2009  4:51AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like this idea, or at least its implications.

Therefore, I would expect this rule to cut out all of the idle chatter and bread-haggling and whatnot in favor of dialogue with real impact. On the other hand, unless the players converse amongst themselves to reach consensus, each character would be more likely to act independently. Overall, I think an intertitle rule would make for a very pulpy, high-action game. I think if I were designing such a game, I would want to reward players for using this rule to the best effect, similarly to the way most games reward action over talking.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_219632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219632/#Comment_219632" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-20T13:11:44+00:00" title="July 20, 2009  1:11PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I thought, originally, that you were talking about playing with a silent movie running in the background.<br/>I just thought up a brilliant Ribbon Drive hack where instead of playing CDs in the background, you play silent films.<br/>I'm not sure how seating would work, but that could be brilliant.<br/><br/>Mmm!
