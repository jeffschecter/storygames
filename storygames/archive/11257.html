I was able to get in a few games of D&amp;D 4e, which was fun, but never seemed to scratch my gaming itch. After looking around all the new RPG goodies delivered during Christmas, I had the sinking feeling that I was amassing a collection of games that I would never have the chance to play... Then I came up with a neat idea. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know enough gamers in my area to put together a one-shot or something, but most players are simply too busy to do a sustainable campaign or weekly gaming. Instead I'm going to do a once-a-month one shot of every RPG I own (including some free ones). My picks, a mix of traditional and story games, are listed below:<br/>\n<br/>\nMouse Guard (probably run the Delivering Mail mission in the book)<br/>\nLady Blackbird<br/>\nWarhammer FRP 3e<br/>\nShotgun Diaries<br/>\nMutants and Masterminds<br/>\nBurning Wheel (Probably run the sword)<br/>\nSavage Worlds<br/>\nD&amp;D 3.5<br/>\nD&amp;D 4e<br/>\nStar Wars Saga Edition<br/>\nCall of Chtulu<br/>\nA wild card pick (maybe Dogs in the Vineyard or Apocalypse World)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy questions for you all:<br/>\n<br/>\nAny good one-off scenarios for some of these games that you're aware of? Any suggestions for the monthly order in which I play (There is a lot of fantasy in there so a mix would be good)? Any games that should be added or knocked off the list?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_250037">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250037/#Comment_250037" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-08T05:56:59+00:00" title="January  8, 2010  5:56AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lady Blackbird is its own scenario, of course.<br/><br/>Everyone has their own favourite one-shot towns for Dogs.
