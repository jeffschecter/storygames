Briefly defined, this is a focus on using old (often considered obsolete) rulesets (typically some form of D&amp;D) and old styles and habits of play.  The contention is that these older methods of play were enjoyable not just because they were all that we had at the time, but in fact provide points of interest uniquely their own, in contrast to more modern games and styles of play.  Some members of the OSR community have simply never stopped playing these older games, while others are returning to them, or even discovering them for the first time.<br/><br/>There is much discussion in the OSR community of the <a href="http://www.megadungeon.net/" rel="nofollow">megadungeon</a>, and the so-called "sandbox" style of play.  Simply put, this is play focused on undirected exploration of an environment (typically an underground labyrinth), the broad outlines of which are created in advance, but not exhaustively detailed.  The environment is explored over multiple expeditions, often by different sets of characters and or players, and the outlines are gradually filled in through a combination of player action, GM inspiration, and random chance.  There is no story, except as players retell their exploits after the fact.  Thus this style of play is quite deliberately "story after".<br/><br/>In light of all this, I pondered how one might attempt to recreate some of this sandbox style play in the context of a convention game, and especially a convention such as GPNW, where play sessions typically last three or at most four hours.  And so I decided to engage in a gaming and social experiment.  I would run (or at least offer) the same game throughout the whole of the convention, and each session would represent one or two expeditions, with whatever players and characters were interested at that time.  The effects of each previous expedition would remain part of the world, and be discoverable by or have impact on the next.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rafial" title="rafial"><img alt="rafial" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rafial">rafial</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215624/#Comment_215624" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-30T22:19:20+00:00" title="June 30, 2009 10:19PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The rule set I used was <a href="http://www.swordsandwizardry.com/" rel="nofollow">Swords &amp; Wizardry</a>, which is a rationalized "retroclone" of OD&amp;D (Original D&amp;D).  This refers to the rules that came in three little brown booklets in the little white box.  S&amp;W incorporates much of the ruleset as found in the original three books, plus a few elements from Greyhawk, the first D&amp;D supplement.  To this I added, as was the fashion at the time, <a href="http://docs.google.com/View?id=dcm9st7c_2ddrtjffm" rel="nofollow">my own house rules</a>.<br/><br/>The sandbox was "The Darkness Beneath", a megadungeon which is being published a level at a time in the magazine <a href="http://www.fightonmagazine.com/" rel="nofollow">Fight On!</a>. They've published 4 levels so far. The majority of the weekends adventuring took place in the "Upper Caves", which appeared in issue <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>, with briefest of excursions into "The Spawning Grounds of the Crabmen."<br/><br/>To this I added an absolutely invaluable Dungeon Detritus table from Fight On <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>, and the ominously titled "Death's Door" table, also from FO#3.  I was also intending to use the "Dungeon Escapes" table from the <a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/paperback-book/miscellaneum-of-cinder/7023638" rel="nofollow">Miscellaneum of Cinder</a>, but it turned out not be an interesting thing to do, at least in this context.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_215626">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rafial" title="rafial"><img alt="rafial" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rafial">rafial</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215626/#Comment_215626" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-30T22:22:24+00:00" title="June 30, 2009 10:22PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wound up running 3 sessions.  15 characters descended into the caves, and, to my surprise, none died! No punches were pulled, and still only one character made it to the Death's Door table, and squeaked by with a lucky roll.<br/><br/>From my side of the table, it was fascinating to see the dungeon evolve from the broad sketch provided in the module. The module contains specific encounters but large parts of the map are unpopulated. The combination of wandering monster rolls, strategic use of the Dungeon Detritus table, and simply responding to the  players' inquiries began to give character to areas of the dungeon.<br/><br/>Details that I established on the fly during one expedition would come back and gain more dimension for another party.  If the players chose to parley with a group of randomly rolled monsters, I suddenly was challenged to think about what they had been doing before the players came on the scene.  Over the course of three sessions, what had been fairly dry set of rooms and numbers began to take on a real life for me.  Hopefully I was able to communicate some of that to the players.  At the same time as a GM, I was not faced with burden of memorizing large amounts of detail enmass.  I started the first expedition having done a fairly cursory reading of the module (which at that is only 8 or so pages), but by the end it had acquired much detail, both in my mind and in my notes.<br/><br/>The other great outcome of the sessions was the creation of three unique, player drawn partial maps of the dungeon, drawn from my verbal descriptions. Each one added so much flavor over simply drawing a layout for the players. I was able to feed the map from the first expedition back around to the third, and it was great to watch the players reinterpret the map through their own lens. That was the only session to feature a returning PC, Chris Bennet's Repugnata the Sorcerer (who also got played at one point by Matthew SB).  During that expedition, Repugnata was able to give her interpretation of various dungeon features as the party encountered them, which was so much cooler than the DM giving an info dump. It really began to fulfill my goal of the dungeon as a living place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rafial" title="rafial"><img alt="rafial" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rafial">rafial</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215627/#Comment_215627" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-30T22:22:43+00:00" title="June 30, 2009 10:22PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 30, 2009 10:43PM by rafial.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Overall, I think my experiment was a very successful one.
