The following is an actual play report for Lacuna, Part 1 that contains spoilers. Players, be warned! This was my first time running the system, and it occurred over 3.5hrs at Big Bad Con on Oct 9, 2011. It is also posted on The Forge (http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forge/index.php?topic=32092.0). <br/>\n<br/>\nI would also like to note that I\u2019m indebted to Thomas D (http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1817) for his excellent ideas about running Lacuna at a con (I used a couple of his handouts) and an AP where the Agents were administered a questionnaire by Control while in Blue City (I was inspired by this to build the bubble-sheet questionnaire given at the interlude) - I\u2019m having trouble finding the exact post right now. There are questions at the end - I would love your feedback!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n******SPOILERS*****<br/>\n<br/>\n\u201cGET YOUR ASS DOWN THAT TUNNEL, AGENT, OR WE\u2019LL NEVER GET MINER.\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\n\u201cMiner? He was my mentor.\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\n\u201cAww, fuck! Agent, I need you to eject immediately.\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\n\u201cNo.\u201d And then he pinned the Lacuna device to his superior officer, turned it to the right, and counted, \u201cOne, two, three.\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Synopsis:<br/>\n<br/>\nOver the course of two missions, the recruits went from efficient and loyal agents to paranoid and insubordinate fuckers. In the first mission, they hunted down Matt Smith, a high school star ball player that had murder his girlfriend while under the influence (the exact substance was redacted). I threw lead after lead at them, and they concluded: He was a drug dealer that had gone off the deep end. After beating up his provider and interrogating his best friend at the school, they burst into a party at the suburbs and found the sucker. Before he could react, Agent Butler smacked him across the face with a pipe, and a 12-foot tall grotesque basset hound burst from his body. The agents subdued it handily.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe then took a break; the agents filled out mission reports and were given post-mission evaluation forms (bubble sheets). They were asked to what extent they agreed with statements such as \u201cI am amiable and well-liked.\u201d and \u201cI have never been a member of the Communist Party.\u201d We did advancement and took a brief bathroom break.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe next mission was fucked from the get-go. Agent Graves was incorrectly inserted into the Financial District, where he promptly received a call from Control insisting that he meet up with Agents Wood, Carver, and Roper to flush out the subject (he\u2019d never heard these names before). After deceiving a businessman coming into the office, Graves disregarded the call and proceed to meet up with the other agents to pursue their mission.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey were to be on the tail of a Marxist terrorist, the last of her team to be taken in by the Nasrudin Institute. She had bombed a bank, and was the head of a dangerous dissident organization. A bomb went off in the Capital District. Control was high as fuck. They beat up some thugs, and found a potential lead. Agent Fuller received a strange note, from \u2018Jones to Alejandra\u2019 - questioning revealed that Jones had been snagged by the police about a week ago. The team ended up at the Library in the Capital District, as she was rumored to hang around there and Graves was (after being called again) ordered to meet Agent Roper there to regroup. The other two agents were dead.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust as Agent Roper seized control of their squad, they saw their quarry; three burst off running. Agent Fuller took her down, and as she looked up at him she said, \u201cJones? How did you get here?\u201d Graves approached, asked what she was doing her, and waited for a Hostile Personality to manifest. It didn\u2019t. He pinned her anyways. The rest followed from there: Conflicting demands from Roper and Control, the reveal that they were hunting Agent Miner, and Graves\u2019 severe insubordination.<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Static, Heart Rate, and Pacing:<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point Agent Fuller was in his target heart rate; the others were still below. Static was about 15; Graves\u2019 insubordination and the rampant use of techniques (documents, writer, caller) pushed it way up. I ended early, and would have preferred to stretch out the second mission, push for more rolls. While they were paranoid and scared by the end, it lacked the punch and danger I was hoping for (which would have come if any had maxed out).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe jump between missions was way too severe. They went from a straightforward mission to one with a bad monitor, a paperwork fuck-up, a potentially innocent victim (the HP never showed), the origin of a Mystery Agent,and Miner. I was eager to throw them into the bureaucratic mess, and rather than having it increase over time it was generally present from the start of the second mission. The Agent with caller (free pings to Control) realized that Control wasn\u2019t going to be helpful after a requested surveillance van showed up as a gypsy cab full of S&amp;M gear, and just stopped from there; static was too obvious and pervasive from the start.<br/>\n<br/>\n---- On the session itself:<br/>\n<br/>\nI was immensely impressed with the focus of my players. They were expressive and inventive in narration, had no side conversations, and were evidently immersed. I credit this to a formality I took and the power of the character creation process. I dressed up formally: black pants, collared white shirt, tie, good shoes. I led them through the process, assigned codenames and mentors, and had clear control of the situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis didn\u2019t end up stifling the game, however. Instead, it created a sort of situation where I defined the outlines of the story we would tell, and they filled in the details. At the start of the first mission I dropped them in a hotel, and asked them what they did. The players paused. It took them a moment, and then they stepped into action. The player in charge of Agent Graves took to the power of his rolls most quickly. He decided there would be cheerleaders on the field, and asked them some questions that revealed the subject had been missing school, gave them some leads.<br/>\n<br/>\nI created a briefing for each mission, with a summary of the subjects\u2019 crimes, their history, and warnings about the challenges they might face. Sentences were redacted. I didn\u2019t read them aloud or force the investigation to follow leads there, but the players seized them. I knew that the first subject was intoxicated with something (maybe an experimental substance?) when he committed murder. They took this and made it clear that he was a regular user and drug dealer, that he\u2019d have a big party that night at his house. It was great, and things flowed really well.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne player said that the bubble sheet really helped him to think about his character. Where the official sheet has little to do with the temperament or background of the character itself (brillianty, I think), this forced the players to consider: \u201cAm I sexually desireable? Do people like me? Do I trust my fellow agents?\u201d Agent Butler, the one that smacked the kid across the face with they pipe, strongly disagreed with the statement \u201cI am amiable and well-liked.\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\n---- If I did it again:<br/>\n<br/>\nI would have definitely scaled down the twist and mystery of the second mission, and pushed for action with a hint of disillusionment/paranoia (especially if I were running this long-form). I would have made Lacuna devices for each of the players to wear (I really love the imagery of them pinning it on monsters, and want them to have something to physically play with). There would have been burnt black coffee at the interlude. I also wanted to use Thomas D\u2019s \u201cControl is Eating a Sandwich\u201d static condition, but Control was already high as fuck and I was really hungry, so I ended up just devouring the thing anyways, instead of waiting to take a bite each time they dialed Control.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Questions:<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you amp up action and push for rolls in the course of the mission? It seemed that each one would proceed similarly: Agents hunt for leads, find the HP, and then pin it; most of the need for rolls seemed to come at the end, and I wasn\u2019t sure how to make moves against them.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow have you handled narrative authority in Lacuna? I ruled that, if they won they roll, they would get to narrate the success of their goal, whether it be leaping on cars, catch up with a giant oozing basset hound, or convincing a high school punk to tell the agent where he gets his dope. If they failed, I would narrate and usually make things more difficult for them. If they succeed on Access, they get what they want; otherwise I get to play. The one place I struggled with this was with Navigation rolls. If they fail, they don\u2019t end up where they wanted to go? How does this make the story more interesting or drive narrative? I had them end up in the wrong part of town and get held up, but it felt diversionary and the only insincere moment of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow much have you twisted the naive idea that the Institute is benevolent, well-run, and hires trained professionals as Mystery Agents? Did you ease into it, and what were the first elements you included? I\u2019d love to hear how it turned out.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_345613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345613/#Comment_345613" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-11T19:34:52+00:00" title="October 11, 2011  7:34PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 11, 2011 7:36PM by zircher.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My preferred style is pretty sandbox, but I do have a standard set-up that I like and hopefully it gives the players a consistent grounding point.  <br/><br/>[WARNING - This is a How The Sausage is Made warning for any of my future players.]<br/><br/>I create a detailed dossier on the patient; the file includes a ton of clues about the patient, their crime, people they know, and habits.  I then write up a static table that tends towards the thematic (and is flavored by the patient's mental state) and I briefly sketch out several possible locations that the HP could haunt.  With that prep work, I always start the agents in the ready room with it dingy walls, decaf coffee, magazines of dubious vintage, and elevator music (the instrumental version of Back in Black is a favorite.)  <br/><br/>I then role play a green level agent that presents the case, fields any questions, and will promise to do any additional investigation that the Mystery Agents ask for (it's a great feedback loop when Control calls in and gives the Agents any additional info, red herrings, and other tweaks.)  From there, I walk the players through security and operations where they meet their Control agent and medical staff (hint of possible danger, make sure to include a description of the crash cart) and begin the dive.<br/><br/>I have a ritual where Control whispers the half of the activation code to the Mystery Agent and the player has to whisper back their half of the pass code/phrase.  The players can only hear static as the Control code is a secret to their own conscious mind.  Thus begins the knowledge that there's a bunch of mental crap going on in their own heads that even they don't know about.<br/><br/>The leader of the mission is always dropped into the Green Level where they get their first taste of the patient's mental state, very surreal stuff.  Then, there's the trip to Blue Level and entry into Blue City itself, tons more color/mood text and the navigation rolls for the other team-mates.<br/><br/>From there, the players take over.  I've seen Dragnet, Scott Pilgrim, and Men in Black all 'manifest' as play styles.  Lacuna is a resource game and those resources are static and heart rate.  Depending on how the players manage those resources, things can spiral out of control or the players might be forced to scrub a mission.  But, I always try to paint things with that 'weird' brush.  There's a general wrongness with Blue City and the more waves you make, the more the City itself will push back.<br/><br/>Thoughts? Comments?

They can have problems with local authorities or other issues besides the target itself.  <br/><br/>Narrative authority was generally traditional in my game.  Players have a lot of control over their own success or failure.  <br/><br/>I definitely twisted the idea of a benevolent Institute.  I ran a ten-session mini-campaign where a host of things went wrong, and where everyone eventually turned against the Institute.  I have some mostly-incoherent notes on the campaign on my web-page here: <br/><br/><a href="http://www.darkshire.net/jhkim/rpg/lacuna/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.darkshire.net/jhkim/rpg/lacuna/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_346013">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346013/#Comment_346013" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-14T17:19:56+00:00" title="October 14, 2011  5:19PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really like that approach.
