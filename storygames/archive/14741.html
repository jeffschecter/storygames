A few weeks we ran Jailbreak with AW.  I'd thought it might work pretty well for the particular scenario - it's nicely constrained and doesn't lean particularly heavily on the UA setting.  As we were playing it out though, it became clear that not only was Apocalypse World a really good system for Jailbreak, but even moreso it would probably work really incredibly well for ongoing UA.  <br/><br/>As an example, it's always bothered me a bit that high Mind characters are most resistant to Stress Checks - but the five stresses map really quite well to AW stats; well enough that I'd guess that anyone familiar enough with both systems would come up with the same mapping.  So, the Stress move is: when confronted with a stressful situation roll+[stat] - 10+ no problem, 7+ clear reaction, miss: the MC's move can involve you taking action.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335338">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335338/#Comment_335338" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-20T09:15:08+00:00" title="July 20, 2011  9:15AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ryan Macklin was working on this for a bit...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335382">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335382/#Comment_335382" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-20T12:20:03+00:00" title="July 20, 2011 12:20PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 20, 2011 12:21PM by Ryan_Macklin.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ended up ditching Weird, because every character is a Weird character.

A miss on your percentile dice is a miss in AW terms. A hit is a 7-9 in AW terms. Cherry (ugh) is a 10+. Maybe impale is a 12+, if you're allowing for the possibility of transcendence like the expanded moves in AW. All skills give you questions to ask, costs to avoid paying, or hold to spend. You get one question/option/hold on a hit, and three on cherries. The GM gets extra guidance (and can be lazier), the players get to steer the GMing around a bit, and everyone wins.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335420">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester" title="Judson_Lester"><img alt="Judson_Lester" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://judsonlester.info/initials.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester">Judson_Lester</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335420/#Comment_335420" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-20T16:49:06+00:00" title="July 20, 2011  4:49PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Macklin</cite>because every character is a Weird character.</blockquote>\nI love how UA generates such radically different experiences.

AW could be the way here.</blockquote> I'm positive it is. Writing up each of your skills as a move, using guidelines like the ones I proposed:<br/>1. answers the question, "what does it mean that I succeeded better or worse?"<br/>2. helps get everyone at the table to agree on what the skill means, which sharpens our shared image of the fiction<br/>3. tosses out flags to the GM, who, if he's anything like me, will appreciate the help<br/><br/>By the way, I think it's probably better to say something like, "for each 25% (or 20%, or whatever) you pass by, choose one:" rather than the precise thing I outlined above, which makes perfect sense in the game I'm writing but is less good in the full UA framework.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
