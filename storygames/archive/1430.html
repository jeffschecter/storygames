                    I managed to knock out the first rough draft of DEAD last night, amazingly.  It's available here:<br/><br/><a href="http://dead.kumapageworks.org/files/dead_rough_distrib_1.a.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://dead.kumapageworks.org/files/dead_rough_distrib_1.a.pdf</a><br/><br/>It's the rules and the character sheet, right now.  The mechanics are card-based, so there's not much 'content' to see right now - but you can get a sense of how the game is to be played, at least.  If anyone would like to take a look at it and knock holes in the mechanics (or the concept!), I'd appreciate it.<br/><br/>There are still some holes in it - anything with an @ is a number that I haven't pinned down yet.<br/><br/>My next task is to write out the character Traits and the text for the cards, of course.  Hopefully that won't take more than a week or so.  Then it's on to alpha-testing!  And bugging Wisconsin SGers!  For playtests!                </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Cool, Brian.  It sounds like you have big, boxy plans for this - awesome!</blockquote>
It didn't start that way, but between the random assignment of the Dead role (meaning that you might have someone inexperienced with the game getting it), and the need to inject some balance into the creation of zombie threats, I thought I needed a card mechanic for the Dead role.  The Story Cards are simply an extension of what were at first Goal Cards, which are a bit like Eric's Motivations.
<blockquote>My first comment - Baltimore?  Dude, respect your zombie roots:  Pittsburgh.</blockquote>
I know Baltimore, so I know where things like the hospitals and police stations are for the resources.  It'll help with making over-arching goals and scenarios, too.<br/><br/>The next one I plan to do is DC, for the same reason.  I have nothing against Pittsburgh, though - I'd be happy to collaborate on a map with someone.  :^)
<blockquote>I'm re-reading Eric Provost's INFECTED in preparation of a playtest and you guys cover a lot of the same territory.  I hope you've looked over his playtest version.</blockquote>
I have, actually.  It's far more narrative in design than mine is - one of my big things is mixing traditional types of games together.  In this case, a Talisman-esque boardgame with a more serious roleplaying mechanically tied to it.  Depending on how the first round of playtesting goes, I hope to include a generous section on how to make a long-running DEAD campaign.<br/><br/>But I need to see if the thing actually works, first.                        </div>
