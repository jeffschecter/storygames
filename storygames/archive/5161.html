And whenever I see those snippets, I'm left wondering: What changes? What problems did it solve?<br/><br/>So, this is it. NOW I want to know. I want to now what problems Andy had with Shadowrun and how Erics changes solves then and I want to know how awesome Andys SR games are now. ^_^                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_116645">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116645/#Comment_116645" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-27T15:02:50+00:00" title="December 27, 2007  3:02PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe Eric can swing by and drop the file or an approximation of it at some point (he's hard at work now, then he coems home tonight, then leaves with Lisa for a several-day family gathering, so I'm not sure how much time he has, but I whispered him a BUMP so he notices when he signs in).<br/><br/>OK, so for the record: I might have been exaggerating a bit about not being able to stand it.  I played quite a bit of 1e in high school, had about every sourcebook for it until 2e came out, and then basically fell into TORG and AD&amp;D 2e so hard that I never came back out for SR, save for a one shot here or there.  So I never had anything past 1e, though I peeked at 2e, and flipped through 4e (which I thought was a good, solid move, but I wasn't too fond of the "point buy" system, which seemed to make SR character generation even *longer*, yikes!). The *best* SR experience I ever had, hands down, was when we did a freeform larpy SR game in a three hour drive from Green Bay to a rave in Madison with some friends. No dice, all acting and description and attitude, it was a blast!<br/><br/>The games we always played were the typical: You're all in Seattle, doing jobs for doublecrossing Johnsons, getting into gunfights at every 7-11, facing off against corps to make a buck, etc. Later, I thought it would be cool to play like a group of Amerindian council members on the outskirts of a city, or like the IT/security department of a genuinely "nice" company keeping out hackers and psychos with guns. But by that time (mid 90s onward) I'd just not really been interested in the core system, but not really sure why. Later, I had the vocabulary to describe what it didn't do for me. I then thought about giving it another shot at some point recently, but using:<br/><br/>RISUS<br/>Primetime Adventures<br/>Feng Shui (YES!!!)<br/>etc<br/><br/>So then there's Eric. Eric lives in the area, and in the past year or two we've become fast friends, gaming buddies and general hang-out friends (Lisa, too). Eric's got his own story with SR, but basically he played the fuck out of it. Probably played or ran as much SR (2nd edition) as I did AD&amp;D 2e. His concession is, "Shadowrun is Awesome!  It doesn't even need to be all hippie-fied!  It just needs to be streamlined a bit, for me anyway, to be a game that would appeal to us these days*." (* these days being, "Gamer with Job, not a lot of prep time, loving the role playing, liking die rolling but not tedium). <br/><br/>So what Eric did was made a few-dozen page hack that is not like his Red Box hack for D&amp;D which reinvents the original game, but rather like D&amp;D 3e's "E6" mod (the one where everyone plays characters levels 1 up to 6, and no further) that changes a few things but leaves the backbone of the game.<br/><br/>Here's what he loves about Shadowrun, that needed to be 'fixed' (read "streamlined"):<br/>The Gunfights<br/>The Shopping<br/>The Lifestyles<br/>The Idea of Hacking<br/>Shamanistic Mages<br/>Cyber Gear<br/>The Future Setting Stuff<br/>The Missions<br/>I'm sure I'm leaving out a few things.<br/><br/>Here's how he fixed them.<br/>The Gunfights: Streamlined. I'm honestly so far removed from the original combat system, I forget how it works. Eric uses rules for autofire, reloading, bullet tracking, all of it: Just streamlined a bit to prevent repetitive BS. Eric can speak more on that. Also, instead of dueling every punk to the death, and not flipping so hard that there are "mook rules", Eric has a "multiple characters act as one" system hack, as well as a "morale vs wounds" hack, which says that unless they're military, you don't have to kill every single punk to make them drop their weapons and flee or beg for their lives.<br/><br/>The Shopping: Shopping in SR is awesome. Without it, the Resource column in chargen means jack and shit. And with it, you've got tons of cool gear and background to add to your character. It's like a joyful experience, not dissimilar for me from making a Gaia Online avatar or something. But he streamlined it by making all gear priced in increments of 1,000 nuyen. If it's less than 1000 nuyen, fuck it you can have three. It doesn't matter.  Everything else, though, runs in 1k increments. This makes it really easy to do shopping during character generation.<br/><br/>The Lifestyles: Apparently in 2e/3e there were all sorts of plusses and minuses for taking different lifestyles. And you had to have a certain upkeep: The food you ate, the place you stayed, etc. You could live in a mansion and eat like a dog. Instead, at character generation (and presumably later) you just have a flat "buy your lifestyle, which is everything from home to food to social status to whatever", 0 is squatter, 5k is vagrant shanty town (which is the common lifestyle in this setting), 25k is low life, and so on upward to something like 300k for the upper crust. I bought 25k, figuring that I was a member of the Yakuza, which came with certain perks. What does this mean rulewise? Jack and shit. What does this mean for character concept and story possibilities? A ton. I love it.<br/><br/><b>CONTINUED</b> <br/><br/>So we're using pretty much an SR 2e character sheet to play. We're using all the stats, a refined skill list, and all the combat/hacking/rigger/etc pools to do shit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_116649">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116649/#Comment_116649" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-27T15:36:39+00:00" title="December 27, 2007  3:36PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 27, 2007 3:37PM by Andy.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>(CONTINUED)</b><br/><br/>The Idea of Hacking: Hacking in SR up to 4th edition (which apparently fixes a lot) is "ok, me and the GM are going to hack this PC, everyone else go order a pizza". Instead, hacking is quick, but still retains the 1e/2e/3e TRON feel of moving from node to node. Your decking is determined by you skill, your deck, and your software. But unlike SR, you don't buy "Tracking 2, Black Ice 3, Attack 2, Scan 4, etc". Rather you have 3-4 levels of programs (presumably written or bought): "Low level, Run of the Mill, State of the Art, etc". Each has a cost associated with it.  I mean, after all who gets like one software at 6 while the others are rated 1?  So this basically represents an aggregated average of All Software on your Deck. In other words, it was easy as shit to make my decker: Picked an above-average deck, and the 2nd highest rank of software (in my description, I wrote most of it myself, but a corp character could just as easily have purchased it all, etc).<br/>Eric can speak more to how decking works so that the other players don't have to be ignored.<br/><br/>Shamanistic Mages: I never played a mage in SR, but apparently Shamanistic mages get their nuts kicked compared to academic mages, and for just some dinky-weak power.  And a nature spirit shaman in the city apparently gets kicked in the nuts every 10 mintues in classic SR.  To counteract that... Er I dunno, I'm not playing a mage so I didn't read that section. But basically nature shaman don't get disads in the city, and on top of that their shamanistic abilities (animal affinities, etc) are pumped up more.<br/><br/>Cyber Gear: Instead of "essense loss" you have "Cyber Index".  This just means whether or not your injuries have to be "healed" or "repaired". I'm not sure the whole consequence profile of this (as my dude just has a data Jack: Shane's Rigger has the wired reflexes and the works), but basically you are flesh and thus it is not "harder" to be healed with magic. It's still easy to be healed, but only to a certain point. Then you have to find a cyberdock.<br/><br/>The Missions: Not every one is a doublecross. Also, the one that we've begun is filling out more like a freeform version of The Wire: We're doing setup, asking for information aroudn town, investigating, getting a feel for things, and all along the GM is just using that to reflexively reveal more info or make it up on the spot. In other words, there doesn't seem to be a "right way" to go about doing the missions, they're pretty freeform.  This isn't a rules thing so much as a mindset change, and it's refreshing. I realized late in our last game that I was describing all sorts of surveillance and investigation actions in a "question format", looking at Eric's poker face to see when The Big Fuckover is coming (cause it was always like that in my old games: test out the waters until you feel the tug of "the plot path", or until the GM resists and starts fucking with your rolls). We were still rolling and all, but it felt much more like we, as PCs, were doing more of the mission creation, which was pretty cool.<br/><br/>Car chases: Eric has cobbled a system so as to make car chases fun and thrilling, and not grueling roll-fests.<br/><br/>Skills: All the skills have been reduced to a list of about 20 or so skills that are used regularly.<br/><br/>The Future Setting Stuff: Eric P had a thread earlier this year, like "recommend me a book". Someone recommended him Snow Crash. Whomever that was, Thank You.  Our default setting for this campaign is a floating island of lashed-together boats and refugees from far and wide, on an artificial island which is now several miles long off the coast of Peru, and supports a bustling metropolis next to raw squalor.  The place is carved up into Franchise Governments.  My Japanese dude is a member of the Yakuza: It's obvious that my boss, a white blond guy who speaks perfect Japanese and is really pro-nationalistic japan, purchased a Yakuza franschise license. Each district is its own government, with some lawless areas.  It's also got a very "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lagoon" rel="nofollow">Black Lagoon's Roanapur</a>" vibe to some areas (I'm also writing a bit of background blobs to make it a little like Egan's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distress_%28novel%29" rel="nofollow">"Stateless" from Distress</a>). We're on a floating island after all, we gotta have boat runs.<br/><br/>That's about it, off the top of my head.<br/><br/>My guy is a face man and decker. Human. Really smart, with good gear but not top of the line (I decided to be a great faceman and a decent decker, rather than a master decker).  Shane's guy is a rigger, with all sorts of cool tricked out shit in his car and boat.Together, we <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">fight</span> <b>make</b> crime. In our next session, two more players will join us. Hopefully a meta and maybe a mage?<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_116652">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116652/#Comment_116652" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-27T15:49:45+00:00" title="December 27, 2007  3:49PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This sounds pretty sweet.

My *wife* loved it, and she normally only likes anime with quality/substance (or about gay angels). A lot of it is pure Gun Porn. GUN. PORN. But the parts about the jobs, and the city, and especially the awesome doublecrosses and the Russian "Hotel Moscwa" gang leader, the shit gets real awesome. A lot of people are attracted by the anime-style gunfights (the main chick is a Chinese-American with two pistols, who like leaps from boat to boat shooting dudes in the face). It's action-bloody, and I'm kinda sick of blood these days, but the story parts are really really cool. You can get the first disk from Netflix to give it a peep, or the entire fansubbed thing from Other Sources.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_116717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116717/#Comment_116717" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-27T21:02:32+00:00" title="December 27, 2007  9:02PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For the record, there were several folks who recomended Snow Crash to me.

It's been a ton of work getting it just right.  Just as an example, I was looking at the list of vehicles tonight and decided that there were too many redundant cars, not enough motorcycles, and not nearly enough boats.  I mean, we're playing on an artificial island that's criss-crossed with canals.  There must be more boats!<br/><br/>Once I get this thing ready to my satisfaction, I'll put it up online.

I included a Health spell for repairing cars, cyberdecks, and characters who are more machine than flesh.  And I'm looking carefully at turning Hermetic Mages into TechnoMages.  Primarily by replacing the four elements that they can normally summon (earth, air, fire, and water) with five "technological elements", such as Electricity, Plastics, Metals, Glass, and ...?  I haven't actually finished that bit yet.  But I'd like to see mages summoning a powerful Plastics Elemental to do their bidding.  That would rock.</p>\n<p>Which reminds me of the changes I've been working on with the Sorcery section.  I always thought it was kinda crappy that Mages had to invest so many resources (Karma) into getting really powerful spells... and then they get kicked in the balls for using those really powerful spells. I mean, the higher the Force you cast, the more drain you took.  And if you cast too high of a spell, you could literally burn yourself up.  It put a serious lid on the awesomness of the spellcasters.  I've taken off that lid by giving each spell a drain code that has nothing to do with the force of the spell, and by determining that all drain is allways Stun damage, no matter how high the force of the spell.</p>\n<p>I've also pared the spell list down to the Pure Awesome spells, removed all the dead-weight rules that we never used, made summoning interesting and useful for every mage, and changed how you buy your spells.</p>\n<p>Whew, I'd better stop there.

I may have something online as early as the beginning of the week.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_116811">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116811/#Comment_116811" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-28T09:33:45+00:00" title="December 28, 2007  9:33AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting... I, myself, hacked SR between 1st and 2nd... and saw that much of my hacks made it into 2nd (spies?). The most major things I did:<br/>1) Deckers could buy a device to "instantiate" programs in the real world, much like elementalists (in fact, exactly like them; see below). This avoided a lot of the party split, dual GM focus problems we always had in a "standard" run. It also gave deckers something to do when running missions away from ubiquitous cyberspace.<br/>2) Elementalists used an identical system as deckers, which allowed them to summon "on the fly" and even have elementals with "focussed" functions rather than as complete entities.<br/>3) In general, I sought and created parallels throughout the system, so that most tests and task resolution processes were identical, the better to quickly resolve them.<br/>4) I allowed miniaturization (at the x10 cost) on many cyber items, so that they could be installed in helmets or glasses or clothes, the better to allow "light" cyber gear to mages and such. "Heavy" gear, like wired reflexes and smart gun links, still carried the Essence losses, though.<br/>5) As you did, I took a very liberal stance on what constituted an "element." I had recalled that old Dragon magazine insert which was a cube that showed all the elemental planes (and some others) in color on the faces of the cube--there had to be, like, forty of them. Though few folks really ran with it, I had a BLAST with a shadow elementalist NPC villain.<br/><br/>To this day, I can still pull out the chart I made to confirm the parallelness of the systems I hacked. Did it "break" the game" Not really, though it shifted some of the focus (i.e. it became a bit "better" to use magic; cyber gear didn't dominate your character, if you went that route, etc).<br/><br/>HTH;<br/>David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_116942">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116942/#Comment_116942" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-28T20:51:22+00:00" title="December 28, 2007  8:51PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I've set up the blog at <a href="http://sombraconsole.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">sombraconsole.blogspot.com</a>.

Is the way you play someone says "that's f'in' awesome!" and they get a point of Karma from a big box of Karma sitting off in the corner? Or does the someone that fan mails push one if his Karma to the f'in' awesome player? I'm thinking it's the first, but wasn't certain. If awesome things keep happening, in a five scene game session where a mission is completed, it's possible for everyone at the table to wind up with ten Karma for that session, right?<br/><br/>And am I right in thinking in SC there is no astral space at all?

I've always felt that the astral travel thing mixed poorly with all the coporate espionage stuff.  Besides, astral travel was yet another way for one player to take the spotlight while everyone else had nothing to do.  All other excuses aside, I just can't recall a single game of SR that I've been a part of where the astral thing added anything fun to the session.
