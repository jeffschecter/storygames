Essentially, where there's one protagonist and the other participants take the role of opposition. Obviously, some of this is just semantics, but I can see a subtle distinction there that might prove interesting to explore. I'm thinking of, say, a game where the player is a dragon and the GMs take the role of orc hordes and dragonslayers and enemy dragons, etc.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_107903">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eldir" title="Eldir"><img alt="Eldir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i182.photobucket.com/albums/x208/loki_laufeysson/goplay_dotted_32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eldir">Eldir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107903/#Comment_107903" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-12T08:04:22+00:00" title="November 12, 2007  8:04AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Polaris?

Advisors have some level of power, mostly in the form of veto, but are encouraged to offer suggestions, and, of course, play NPCs. The game runs smoothly, and the mechanics ensure a cohesive story without any pre-play prep or any discussion during the game, it's all based on what happens in play.<br/><br/>The designer is on this board as Great Wolf.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_107919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107919/#Comment_107919" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-12T08:47:33+00:00" title="November 12, 2007  8:47AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I keep thinking this is fruitful ground that hasn't been fully explored.

The ashcan PDF is at: <a href="http://mastermines.wordpress.com/projects/know-thyself/" rel="nofollow">http://mastermines.wordpress.com/projects/know-thyself/</a><br/><br/>Unfortunately, I have found a few pitfalls I haven't been able to completely solve with this model of one PC-many GM.  It's a very antagonistic role, where the GMs (called the Chorus) are elements of the Player's (call the Amnesiac) hostile subconscious, and play is done through a series of fever dream-esque scenes.  There are moments when memories are regained where the authority shifts, but that don't happen as often in the game.<br/><br/>I haven't been able to utterly tackle these issues, which primarily stem from every Gm having a stake against the PC but also having equal authority to step on each other's toes.    Talking about that would be a lengthy post or three.<br/><br/>I will also say that Polaris doesn't really fit in this case.  What it has (for any given heart) is more akin to two influential players (the Moons), one GM (the Mistaken) and one PC/GM (the Heart).  The Heart has equal and profound authority in Polaris, enough to say that there are two dueling GMs with people shouting from the wings.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_107987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107987/#Comment_107987" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-12T14:55:19+00:00" title="November 12, 2007  2:55PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Justin D.

Am I wrong on that?</blockquote>\nHmmm... it depends what you mean by rotating GMs. In each scene, GMs serve either as Dominant or Advisor, and being Dominant does switch from scene to scene (which could mean rotating), but at the beginning of the game players divide into Protagonist (one player) or GM (the rest of the players). Like, if you're the protagonist, you're the protagonist for the entire game and the other players are not protagonists (which is exactly how I interpreted the original post). So I guess my question is, what do you mean by rotating GM?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_107996">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cydmab" title="cydmab"><img alt="cydmab" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cydmab">cydmab</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107996/#Comment_107996" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-12T16:09:38+00:00" title="November 12, 2007  4:09PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe I should flesh out the "Moon acting like mistaken case" with an AP example. The demon in the scene was a spirit-voice in the head of the protagonist; the moon's character was the protagonists teenage daughter who was sleeping with a demon. I was mistaken.<br/><br/>Me and the Moon were tag teaming the Heart, trying to put him in a very uncomfortable spot. The moon would say something like "You don't really love me! All you care about is your stupid knight-business! Waah! (I run away)" Then I'd come in as the demon voice "Are you really just going to turn away from your daughter? She needs you right now. Go to her" If he abandons her, I grin evilly, say "And so it was..." and call for an xp check for callousness. If he runs after her, I say "but only if by abandoning your post demons are able to kill an innocent." The moon sets up the protagonist, the mistaken knocks him down.<br/><br/>We have regularly had incidents like this, where the Heart after the scene will comment "damn, it was like dealing with multiple mistakens.

Now, that might have produced powerful play <em>because it worked</em> (and I've had similar moments in my own games of Polaris), but if it hadn't worked then the Mistaken could have blocked it, and the Moon would have just had to accept the block and move on.  That's why I say the Moons are influential, but lack true authority -- they only get authority if one side lets them.  Now, if Justin sees that as a multi-GM setup, then that's fine, but the rules don't actually treat both sides has having equal high authority.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108220">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108220/#Comment_108220" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-14T05:12:15+00:00" title="November 14, 2007  5:12AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>My intuition says that <em>authority</em> isn't actually the function of the Moons.
