<blockquote>I don't think MR has a "pre-defined result". Because if you have agreed to the result before the roll... well, you're resolving stakes. :-)<br/><br/>Remember, this is stakes resolution:<br/>"If you roll a 25 or better, you hit and do 2d8 damage."<br/><br/>So, maneuver resolution would be:<br/>"Roll to hit. DC 25."</blockquote>
So I'd like to expand and discuss John Harper's suggestion of "Stakes Resolution" versus "Maneuver Resolution" -- which I like a lot and seems much clearer to me than many previous Conflict/Task definitions. As I understand it, Maneuver Resolution means that by definition the possible results aren't known at the time of roll.  Though I think a better term might be "Principle Resolution" (i.e. resolve the principle first, and only later arrive at specifics) or perhaps "Abstract Resolution".  Any thoughts?  <br/><br/>Now, here's the tricky part about player knowledge.  Let's take D&amp;D3.  Suppose that I am DM, and I have a monster which has Damage Reduction 10/+2.  So if I try to hit it with a weapons with less than +2 magical bonus, then 10 is subtracted from the damage.  So now the player attacks this monster with a +1 sword.  Is this Stakes Resolution?  <br/><br/>The answer seems to depend on player knowledge.  So suppose the player doesn't know that the monster has damage reduction.  He attacks, and rolls 2d8+5 damage for total 11, and the GM then announces that the monster seems barely affected.  What's going on here?  So there's a concrete principle that the DM is following, but the player doesn't know it.  Then suppose the player realizes that it has DR after another PC attacks with a +3 weapon.  Do his attacks now become Stakes Resolution, where they weren't before?  <br/><br/>This applies equally to all sorts of other rolls.  Suppose I have in my GM notes what the result of succeeding a Perception check at a certain point does.  Is the roll Stakes Resolution?                </div>

                            John, perhaps you're conflating two different resolutions -- the hit, and the damage.<br/>
<br/>
First Resolution: Do I hit Mister Monster?  Stakes are Yes or No.  Roll.  Answer turns out to be Yes.  Stakes resolution.<br/>
<br/>
Second Resolution: How much do I damage Mister Monster?  Stakes are not really defined.  Roll.  Answer turns out to be hardly at all.  Manuever resolution.                        </div>

                            Glad to see these terms catching on. Not to be a wet blanket, but I think you both (John Kim and Joshua) are slightly off the mark.<br/>

I'll try to give nice, clear definitions soon. I have a meeting now, but I'll be back shortly.                        </div>

I would argue that hit and damage rolls are one application of the mechanic, like a multi-step conflict in Dogs.  Just because it's two rolls (or three with a crit threat) doesn't really make it separate mechanics.  If that's a problem, imagine we're using a single-roll system like Buffy or Rolemaster, or in D&amp;D a case where every hit always does exactly 11 points of damage without a roll.  <br/><br/>The point is that once the player realizes that the monster has DR 10/+2, then he knows what the damage result is.  In all cases, the outcome of the damage roll is precisely defined, and follows strict laws.  The only difference is player knowledge of what that is.                        </div>

                            John (Harper) - the way I understand yah:<br/><br/>So we have something that a character wants to do, or that a player wants their character to do. If the outcome of the resolution mechanic is determined before you engage in it, thats stakes resolution. If the outome of that mechanic is only success or failure, and another process must be engaged in order to determine the impact of that outcome on the game fiction, thats manouver resolution.<br/><br/>That looks kinda complicated, reading over it. But the examples in the other thread really clicked for me. Course, if I was smart, I would just wait for you to define your own damn words, but hey.<br/><br/>Of course, by this definition, pretty much every resolution system ever is a mix of conflict and manouver resolution, each kicking in at different times depending on the circumstances. <br/><br/>John (Kim) - <br/><br/><code>Now, here's the tricky part about player knowledge. Let's take D&amp;D3. Suppose that I am DM, and I have a monster which has Damage Reduction 10/+2. So if I try to hit it with a weapons with less than +2 magical bonus, then 10 is subtracted from the damage. So now the player attacks this monster with a +1 sword. Is this Stakes Resolution?</code><br/><br/>The stakes here, as established by the D&amp;D3 mechanics, are "If you hit the monster, you will deal 2d8+1-10 damage. If you don't, you will have no effect on the monster." Now, whether the player knows that or not, doesn't effect that those are the stakes.<br/><br/><code>Suppose I have in my GM notes what the result of succeeding a Perception check at a certain point does. Is the roll Stakes Resolution?</code><br/><br/>Sure. The stakes, as established by the D&amp;D3 mechanics and the GM notes that are being used in conjunction with them, are "If you succeed at the perception check, you will notice X. If you don't, you will not." Now, it the system being used was "Roll a perception check, and if you succeed, I'll make up something appropriate to notice/roll on this chart/ask you for a suggestion" - that would be Manouver resolution.<br/><br/>Uh...I think.                        </div>

I'd like to address you directly and ignore the other stuff that's in this thread so far. But I'm afraid that half-baked (but well meaning) answers like Nathan's will spin off into their own endless debates over terms, just like the last three CR/TR threads.<br/>
<br/>
So, instead of getting pulled into another quagmire like that, I'm going to start my own thread in which I'll define the terms and lay down some ground rules about what kinds of posts are on-topic there.<br/>
<br/>
I think that my definitions will also serve to answer your (very interesting) questions above. In fact, I'll answer them directly in a follow-up post after the definitions.<br/>
<br/>
But this thread is off to a rocky and confusing start, and I'm running away before it gets worse. See you in the other thread.<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: I don't mean to be a dick to you, Nathan. Based on your comments in the other TR thread, I think you're on target. But the explanation above kinda veers back and forth and makes things hard for me address clearly. Totally don't mean to diss on you, bro.                        </div>
