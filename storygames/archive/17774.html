And PC and Mac players can play together.<br/><br/><b>WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THIS THREAD - </b><br/><br/>In this thread we are talking about the upcoming STORY GAMES HYPHEN DOT COM TEAM FORTRESS 2 NOOB NIGHT that is happening on <b><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">January 25, 2013 at 7:30 PM EST.</span></i></b><br/><br/>It will be at this server:<br/><br/>209.247.83.174:27015<br/><br/>The password is: SandVich81<br/><br/>I will tell you how to get everything set up lower in the thread if you don't know what this means.<br/><br/>Also in this thread we will have GIVEAWAYS and CONTESTS.<br/><br/><b>WHO IS INVITED - </b><br/><br/>Everyone!  If you are experienced, now's your chance to meet up with other story-games TF2 players and play them!  <br/><br/>If you are not experienced, show up and learn the best videogame from experienced players in a relaxed, goof-off atmosphere.<br/><br/>Team Fortress 2 is NOT a VARY SERIOUS MODARN SHOOTERGAEM.<br/><br/>This is a game where you eat a sandwich and have adventures.<br/><br/>It is also a game where you are cool and people like you.<br/><br/><b>HOW TO GET INVOLVED -</b><br/><br/>1.  Install Steam: <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/" rel="nofollow">Here is Steam.</a>  The "install steam" button is green and on the upper right.  You can even do this if you are on a Mac.<br/><br/>2.  Once Steam is installed and you are registered, install Team Fortress 2: <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/440/" rel="nofollow">Here is the page where you install Team Fortress 2</a>.  There is a green button halfway down the page that says "Play Game". It is the pro-est of pro-clicks.<br/><br/>3.  Launch Team Fortress 2.  It helps if you launch it at least once Before The Day so it can download any updates.  Also, there is an "Offline Practice" mode that shows you some of the mechanics of the game, and lets you practice against bots, so you can mess around with it without actually venturing into the wide world.  Also it lets you know if your computer is robust enough to play it and if you need to adjust graphical options and such. (Your computer is almost unquestionably robust enough to play it.)<br/><br/>4.  Join the Story-Games.Com Steam Group.  <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/groups/story-games/" rel="nofollow">Here is the link to the group's page.</a>  There is a green button in the upper right that says "Join Group".<br/><br/>5.  Add the story-games.com server to your Favorites.  With Steam running on a PC, right click on the icon and go to 'Servers'.  (On a Mac I'm not sure where the menu is. Click on the Favorites tab, then on "Add A Server".  Copy and paste this: 209.247.83.174:27015 into the box that pops up. It should automatically add the "Unofficial Story Games TF2 Server" to your list.  Feel free to connect anytime, especially if you see people on. The password is SandVich81 .<br/><br/>6.  Post on this thread that you are coming!  If we get a lot of RSVPs, we will play a normal round or two of TF2...if we get 6 or fewer, we will do the Mann vs. Machine co-op mode.  But it will help FigureFour to get things set up if we know in advance.<br/><br/>7.  Check this thread often for a chance to WIN PRIZES. <br/><br/>(If you are an experienced player and you have a crapton of stuff in your backpack that a new person would really like, invent and post your own contests in the thread.)<br/><br/><br/><span class="VideoWrap"><span class="Video YouTube" data-youtube="youtube-C4cfo0f88Ug?autoplay=1"><span class="VideoPreview"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4cfo0f88Ug"><img border="0" height="385" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/C4cfo0f88Ug/0.jpg" width="640"/></a></span><span class="VideoPlayer"></span></span></span><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_402202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark" title="Captain_Thark"><img alt="Captain_Thark" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/674/nQDB5F77NZR8N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark">Captain_Thark</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402202/#Comment_402202" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-30T20:37:23+00:00" title="December 30, 2012  8:37PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm in!

I do not know what any of those words mean.  'Extravaganza' sounds like one of Mussolini's mistresses or something.  I understand that this message will be sent on punch cards, and will be read by thin, stupid people who would rather sit in front of sickly, glowing screens than do pushups and run up hills.<br/><br/>Here is a short list of things you SHOULD be doing instead of being in this contest:<br/><br/>1.  Getting a haircut.<br/>2.  Defending a bunker.<br/>3.  Attacking a bunker.<br/>4.  Yelling.<br/><br/>BUT IF YOU MUST be in this contest, here is what you have to do. <br/><br/>FIRST: You are only eligible for this contest if you have played Team Fortress 2 for less than 8 hours and have joined the story-games steam community.  If you are not sure if you are eligible, open Steam, click on "Community", and then on "Profile", then scroll down and click on View and Search All Games.  Do the clicking with the small device next to your keyboard and NOT with the HAIR TRIGGER of a LOADED SHOTGUN and do the scrolling with the same small device and NOT with the SACRED WAR SCROLLS of SUN TZU, INVENTOR OF FIGHTING.<br/><br/>SECOND: You must post in this thread the following words: "NEW RECRUIT REPORTING FOR DUTY! I DO NOT WANT TO WASTE EVERYONE'S TIME AND LOSE BY BEING A SCOUT OR A FRENCHMAN. I WILL BE A SOLDIER AND I WILL BE AT THE STORY HYPHEN GAMES DOT COM NOOB NIGHT!"  If you can work out a way to make the letters much, much bigger than this, you should. In addition you should stand up and scream this phrase as loud as possible. Do not let the police deter you if your so-called neighbors call them; this is AMERICA.<br/><br/>THIRD: Also post your Steam Name in the thread so we can confirm you are a member of the group and not a COMMUNIST INFILTRATOR.<br/><br/>The first person to fulfill this requirement in this thread will win their choice of:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://tf2wiki.net/w/images/thumb/4/47/Backpack_buff_banner.png/90px-Backpack_buff_banner.png" style="float: left;"/>A <a href="http://tf2wiki.net/wiki/Buff_Banner" rel="nofollow">Buff Banner</a> - Since your teammates are likely to be weak, snivelling bleeders, you will need a way to motivate them to get off their lazy keisters and actually fight.

This weapon will let you move fast enough to accomplish this without being Scout.  (Scout's spindly little girl-arms could not lift a pickaxe anyway.)<br/><br style="clear: both;"/><br/><br/>These are far too many words to express without stopping to eat two raw steaks and drink a mugful of eggs and coffee grounds.

(Trust me, this is a good thing!)<br/><br/>The first person who signs up to play the Heavy Weapons Guy will get a DELICIOUS SANDVICH!<br/><br/>The first Scout will get a bottle of DELICIOUS MILK and a DEAD FISH wrapped in a newspaper.<br/><br/>Our first Medic will recieve a Kritzkrieg!<br/><br/>The first Spy will receive an ICICLE (or another knife of their choice)!<br/><br/>The first person to express an interest being an Engineer will get a ROBOT HAND and a customized SHOTGUN.<br/><br/>And finally, the first person who wants to play Pyro will get a FLARE GUN, a SLEDGEHAMMER, a GIANT LOLLYPOP and some sort of MAGIC RAINBOW MACHINE.<br/><br/>All the rules JD posted apply here too, and you're not obliged to stick with the class you sign up as. Just give them a try and swap if you don't like them.<br/><br/>Also, these are all real items and most of them are actually useful. In TF2, the default weapons are often the best for every class, but there are a few weapons that open up interesting strategies or play styles. I tried to pick some of the really useful ones for each class.<br/><br/>Except for Demoman. I barely have anything for Demoman, but they're pretty much best stock anyway.<br/><br/>Anyway, feel free to shoot me any questions you may have.

Most snobby PC gamers would advise against it because it's not as precise at shooting as a mouse, but whatever. We won't judge you.<br/><br/>In fact, there's a secret subclass called Demoknight that sort of works BETTER with a controller!<br/><br/>Demoknights are Demomen who have equipped a shield instead of their sticky bomb launcher, which gives them damage resistance and a melee charge attack! Normally you can't really turn when you're charging, but apparently there's some sort of bug with the gamepad controls that lets you do sharp precision turns mid-charge.<br/><br/>There are some gamepad using Demoknights who can do CRAZY STUFF!<br/><br/>If you want to play Demoknight, I think I can probably help you out. I know I said I don't have any spare Demoman items, but I think I got a few more since then, including a spare shield. I'd have to double check, but I'm pretty happy to try to make sure that new players get the items they want to try the playstyle that interests them.<br/><br/>Also, isn't 7:30est 3:30pst? I think I'm pst, so I'll be trying to show up 3:30ish.

I typed up an enormous post about TF2 strategy, and it's TOO LONG.<br/><br/>Here's part 1:<br/><br/>So, JD and I talked a bit about what the best maps to run tomorrow would be. This got me thinking about a topic that I love, TF2 STRATEGY! So I'm going to talk about that a bit here, as well as why I picked the maps that I did.<br/><br/>This might get a bit serious, and may even sound not fun. If you're interested, read this post and learn. If you're not interested say "Shut up and quit over thinking this crap, you big dope!" and then go back to having fun and shooting things.<br/><br/>Mostly I'm talking about this because I think it's fun, and because sometimes new players are scared to play because they "will suck" or because "they won't be very good." TF2 is an awesome shooter for beginners because the game is fun and the community is relatively laid back and silly, but also because it rewards teamwork and strategy as much as it does quick reflexes and precise aim. If you learn a few things, you won't suck, even if you've never played before!<br/><br/>Rule <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> of being a good TF2 player is this:<br/><br/>KNOW YOUR OBJECTIVE!<br/><br/>TF2 is not a game about shooting people! It might SEEM like a game about shooting people, but it's actually a game about CONTROL OVER SPACE AND TIME! Shooting people is just your primary method for controlling space and time.<br/><br/>So, know what game mode you're playing and what you're trying to do. Lots of maps will start with a helpful video explaining the game mode and the objective, but in case it doesn't play, or you're too excited when the time comes and you skip it, I'll talk a bit about the game modes I like. (There are a few others, but I don't like them, and they don't fit my theories, so I'm not going to talk about them. Take THAT Capture the Flag!)<br/><br/>My favorite game mode is called "5 Capture Point" or "5cp". These maps tend to work better with larger teams and more experienced players, so we might not play any, but they're a good illustration, and they're my favorite, so I'll talk about them first.<br/><br/>The name comes from the fact that there are five capture points, usually arranged linearly, and to win you have to capture all five. You capture a point by standing on it for a set period of time without any enemies standing on it. Some points take more time than others, and more people capturing at once capture faster.<br/><br/>You have to capture the points in order so, the overall strategy plays like a tug of war. You start with everyone rushing to the middle, and whoever manages to take the middle point (often just called "mid") gets the momentum to keep pushing.<br/><br/>There are TWO major game states that your team can be in: Pushing and Holding.<br/><br/>Pushing is when you are trying to move into territory held by the other team.<br/><br/>Holding is when you are trying to stop the enemy team from pushing into your territory.<br/><br/>Once you "cap mid" your team is probably Pushing, and the other team should be scrambling to hold "second".<br/><br/>This dynamic of push and hold is the key to TF2 strategy, and I think it's expressed most dynamically in 5cp. However, that can be a bit much for new players, and it's pretty easy for one team to win the mid fight and then just COMPLETELY STEAMROLL an inexperienced team for an easy win. That's not fun.<br/><br/>However, there are a bunch of game modes that are SUPER FUN and express that same concept in simpler ways.<br/><br/>For example, there's "Attack/Defend". I got started playing Attack/Defend, so I'll probably try to sneak a map or two in there.<br/><br/>Attack/Defend is sort of like 5cp, only there is no back and forth. There's usually only two control points, and RED team starts with BOTH. BLUE wins if they can capture both points, and RED wins if BLUE hasn't captured the last point before the timer runs out.<br/><br/>This is simpler because you don't have to worry about figuring out when it's a good time to push and when it's a good time to hold. If you're RED, you're holding. If you're BLUE, you're pushing. (Usually... Sometimes BLUE wants to hold for a bit to have time to heal, gather troops in one place, and build a good push. Sometimes RED wants to push BLUE back a bit so they can defend a chokepoint that's further from the objective. But GENERALLY speaking, BLUE pushes, and RED holds.)<br/><br/>Then, there's PAYLOAD. Payload is actually one of the most fun game types in TF2. <br/><br/>In Payload, BLUE is pushing and RED is holding, just like Attack/Defend. BUT in this mode BLUE is LITERALLY pushing, because their job is to push a cart with a GIANT BOMB in it all the way to the RED base! (Pushing the cart works like capturing a point. If a BLUE player stands near it, it moves forward, unless a RED player is nearby to stop it. More BLUE players push faster.)<br/><br/>It's sort of like Attack/Defend, but pushes can be incremental, not all or nothing. There are checkpoints that you want to get the cart too along the way, but they're not dramatically important. They usually just move both teams spawns further down the tracks.<br/><br/>Payload also gives a slight boost to the BLUE team, since the cart supplies nearby allies with health and ammo. Pushing is usually harder than holding, so having a mobile base  a nice perk.<br/><br/>Finally, there's King of the Hill.<br/><br/>King of the Hill has that same back and forth push/hold/counterpush thing that 5cp has, but there's ONLY ONE POINT. You have to hold the point for a total of three minutes to win, which means that you don't LOSE as soon as the other team gets the point. This prevents those sudden and easy win/loss situations from 5cp and makes it easier to figure out WHEN to push and when to hold while still making you do BOTH.<br/><br/>So, as you may have figured out, winning isn't about killing people. It's about being in the right place, or keeping the enemy from being in the right place. Killing people just magically teleports them back to their base, which means they're not in the right place anymore.<br/><br/>This means you can be CREDIT TO TEAM without having to shoot a single enemy. You just need to know where to stand, and you can figure out where to stand by knowing your objective.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404425">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour" title="FigureFour"><img alt="FigureFour" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour">FigureFour</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404425/#Comment_404425" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-24T13:51:11+00:00" title="January 24, 2013  1:51PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And here's part 2:<br/><br/><br/>Rule <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> of TF2 is this:<br/><br/>ALWAYS WORK AS A TEAM<br/><br/>I just talked about knowing where to stand, and there's one factor to that beyond where the objective is, and that's where the rest of the team is. You don't want to be pushing or holding on your own.<br/><br/>As a general rule, there are two players on your team who will dictate the location of your push and hold. <br/><br/>When you're pushing, look for your Medic. The medic is the king of the push, even thought the medic can't really push themselves. This is because the medic can heal you while sticking close to the front lines (no one wants to push while they're hurt) and because the medic has the pusher's SECRET WEAPON, the Ubercharge.<br/><br/>With a charged medigun, the medic can give their heal target NINE SECONDS of TOTAL INVULNERABILITY. That may seem short, but it's just enough to rush past a chokepoint and take out the key to the enemy's defense.<br/><br/>If you see a few guys hanging around a chokepoint with a medic, they're getting ready to push. Wait nearby and go in when they do.<br/><br/>When you are holding, find your Engineer. The Engineer is the king of the hold. They've got a dispenser that will heal you (not quite as well as a medic) AND give you ammo, and they've got a sentry gun that's super tough and deals a LOT of damage. If they've got both of those buildings set up, you're holding THERE even if there's no one else around. You might as well try to make it a good hold and join in.<br/><br/>Engineers will sometimes try to set up a forward base to build a push from (they've also got a teleporter that can be really useful for this), like a Medic, and a Medic might try to lead a hold like an Engineer, but the Engineer is best when dug into a secure area and the Medic is best on the frontline, so Medics tend to push while Engineers hold. Still, those guys both tend to shape their teams position on the battlefield.<br/><br/>Clever players will have also noted that the ENEMY team's location must also be an important consideration. They are RIGHT. If you see an enemy Engineer setting up a sentry, let your team know. If you see an enemy Medic hiding in a chokepoint building Ubercharge, let your team know. Good communication wins games!<br/><br/>Now, the second part of working as a team is knowing the strengths and weaknesses of the classes and picking a class that will help your team win the objective. (It's all coming together.)<br/><br/>Say you're defending on a Payload map. There should probably be an Engineer on your team. Is there? If not, you should play Engineer! If there is, can you play something that supports an Engineer's weaknesses? There are two major threats to an Engineer's sentry: Spies and Ubercharges. Pyros are helpful against BOTH, so if you play a Pyro and defend the sentry gun, your Engineer will love you. (Can you tell that I play Engineer?) Does your team have an Engineer AND a Pyro? Try a Sniper or a Demoman. Both of those guys are great for rounding out a defense.<br/><br/>Maybe you're on the attacking team. Do you have a Medic? If not, play a Medic! Your whole team will love you! If you do, they're going to want to be healing someone, so which classes are best to heal? Heavy Weapons Guy is the "classic" Medic buddy. He's got the highest health, so he benefits most from a Medic's overheal (Did I mention that the Medic can heal you to %150 of your original health? Those guys ROCK.) and are most likely to survive being shot in order to get healed. They also can get the totally awesome Sandvich, which can heal them. Try not to do that though. You can ALSO right click to give the Sandvich to someone else. If you use your Sandvich to keep your Medic alive, you will be INVINCIBLE (note: not actually invincible) and also CREDIT TO TEAM (note: actually a credit to the team). Is there already a Heavy around? Demomen and Soldiers also play well with Medics, and are useful guys to have around. Play one of them! Scouts also capture points and push carts twice as fast as anyone else, so they're good to have around. They can also be useful for running after the snipers who are bound to be trying to shoot the heads of your Heavy and Medic! Feeling DEVIOUS and BOLD? Play a Spy! Spies are great at compromising enemy defenses, but can't do much on their own. They're awesome at creating an opening right before a push though. If you've got a solid offense running into a solid defense (especially one backed by a good Engineer) a good Spy can make all the difference.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm going to take a break for now. The important thing to take away from this is that there are THREE reasons that TF2 is great:<br/>1. It's a fast paced and light hearted game with a fun atmosphere!<br/>2. It's a deep game that rewards strategy and teamwork!<br/>3. Hats! HATS! HAAAAATS! Seriously though, you get to wear silly hats. If you think wearing silly hats is a bad thing, maybe you shouldn't be playing TF2...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark" title="Captain_Thark"><img alt="Captain_Thark" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/674/nQDB5F77NZR8N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark">Captain_Thark</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404442/#Comment_404442" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-24T15:10:22+00:00" title="January 24, 2013  3:10PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I will probably be a bit late tonight, but I will be on for at least part of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kobutsu" title="kobutsu"><img alt="kobutsu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c22b7a0141698356c899c4f7f1200ed7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kobutsu">kobutsu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404446/#Comment_404446" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-24T15:24:39+00:00" title="January 24, 2013  3:24PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark">@Captain_Thark</a>, it's tomorrow, Friday!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404447">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404447/#Comment_404447" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-24T15:35:16+00:00" title="January 24, 2013  3:35PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            FigureFour is setting up a map rotation since we have enough people to do the real maps.

(I'm still gonna wear my Ghastlier Gibus so those lucky engies who dominate me can have one, cuz EVERYONE deserves a Gibus). <br/><br/>That's some good strategy! I also started with Attack / Defend, and it's stayed my favorite game type by quite a bit. But then, I'm just a simple-minded Pyro player - complicated things like "deciding when to push or hold" are just out of my reach.<br/><br/>Not really, of course. In fact, I've got a few ideas about a Pyro Strategy post if you're cool with me posting it (I'm no pro, but I'm pretty decent I think) - just the basics for new people, especially since Pyro is an easy class to start with. I just don't want to derail the thread with posts like that if you'd rather things don't go that way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404456/#Comment_404456" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-24T16:02:51+00:00" title="January 24, 2013  4:02PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            m1+ w                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404458">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404458/#Comment_404458" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-24T16:16:35+00:00" title="January 24, 2013  4:16PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you want to be mowed down by sentry guns, yeah.

Just shoot while moving. Pyro is dead simple to be basically competent with.<br/>Heck, I'll just make the post.<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY PYRO<br/>Step 1: Walk around burning things. If you can do this, you can play pyro to at least basic ability. You can get along just doing this, and actually doing pretty good from time to time.<br/><br/>Step 2: Learn your drawbacks, and what fights to not pick. You've got two big problems: survivability and range.<br/>Survivability means you have not that much health. Big hits can put you down quite quickly. The big things to look for are Soldiers and Demomen, and keep a weather eye out for Snipers. The first two have explosive weapons, which deal damage quickly. Pyros can't burn you, and Heavies can be strafed if you can get in close, so it's mostly those guys that make problems.<br/>Range means you don't have any long-range weaponry. In fact, your secondary weapon is generally situational/backup, and your melee weapon can get kinda useless if you still have fuel. The threats are, again, Soldiers and Snipers. Well, plus one more...<br/>The Sentry Gun.<br/>The Sentry Guns set up by Engineers do horrible things Pyros. They can get you at long range, with near-perfect accuracy, and can use explosive rockets at Level 3. Engineers hate everything you do since you're great at busting up support structures like Dispensers, but Sentry Guns tear you up.<br/><br/>So what fights do you pick or not pick? Large groups, if caught unawares, are good picking. But avoid long corridors of any kind - the long-range classes can blow you away from the ends, and if it's a blind corner you could be walking into a Sentry Gun. Also beware picking fights with other Pyros - they don't get lit on fire, which makes them harder to kill. Hunt Snipers because they have a hard time once you're up next to them, hunt Medics because the enemy needs them, hunt Heavies because the big slow brutes can be strafed around while you deal good damage, and hunt Spies for a reason you'll see below.<br/><br/>Step 3: Learn to play as a team. This class operates okay even if you pretend you're all alone against the other team, but it's always better to be a team player. As a Pyro, you have two best friends: Medic and Spy. <br/>Medics can't Overheal you very much since that's percentage-based, but as a Pyro you're one of the classes that can do the most damage in the shortest time, making you great at Ubercharge. Plus, Ubercharge is one of the best ways to smash irritating Sentry Guns.<br/>The Spy, on the other hand, can get rid of everything that plagues you - they can get up close without being noticed to remove long-range threats, and can sap Sentry Guns to let you get right in there.<br/>But getting help is only half the battle! How do you help your team? A couple ways. The most obvious is that you burn everything in everyone's path. Less-obvious are your defensive roles. <br/>As a Pyro, you excel at Point Coverage. At least in Attack/Defend, many Capture Points have nice out-of-sight spots to hide in. Stick by a point, and when enemies arrive you can pop out, immediately in your optimal range. Lone Scouts running out ahead are especially vulnerable. Additionally, the second point also helps with coverage:<br/>Spy-Checking is the Pyro's secret skill. See, when you swing your flames over a spy, they light on fire. It doesn't matter if they're disguised or not, they light up. TF2 doesn't have friendly fire (haha) though, so if you light up someone "on your team" you found an enemy spy! Those spies who are running around invisible? They still burn, and the fire's visible. It's harder to catch them, but it becomes a helpful part of Point Coverage. When you're on the point, at relatively frequent rates do a basic little sweep around with your flamethrower, see if you catch anything. Additionally, whenever you pass a friend (and personally I do it almost EVERY time) give them a little puff of your flames to make sure they don't start burnin'. This is what makes you invaluable to Engineers - a well-placed Sentry Gun can take care of everything it sees, and a Pyro to check everything that comes near keeps the Spies away.<br/>Note to all new players, not just Pyros: As far as I can tell, disguised spies can't swap weapons. Shuffling your weapons around at random while running around shows you're not a spy. It can be helpful to people who're concerned about spies - like me!<br/><br/>Step 4: Your Compression Blast. With your flamethrower, press Mouse 2 to let loose a blast of air. This is the most versatile thing a Pyro has, and probably the most underutilized. Personally, I'm not very good with it, but that's also because my weapon of choice gives me only 4 uses rather than 10 from a full fuel tank.<br/>What does it do? The easy examples: Use it to blow out allies on fire and use it to push back enemies who get a little <i>too</i> close.<br/>The more advanced examples: Reflection, clearing, and breaking Ubercharges. The airblast bounces away rockets coming at you, allowing you to turn a Soldier or Level 3 Sentry Gun on itself. This is the best counter you have against these threats. Clearing is a technique against the Demoman's Sticky Bombs - if there's sticking bombs on a surface keeping you out, a compression blast knocks them away. Breaking Ubercharges is the craziest of these skills - so you have an enemy medic ubercharging one of their guys. If you compression blast the medic away, once his beam is too far from his ally the charge turns off but the timer keeps counting, stalling their precious time. <br/>You can even juggle enemies in the air with successive compression blasts.<br/><br/>Step 5: Your secondary gun. Largely unimportant, this is used as your best impression of a longer-ranged attack. The shotgun is okay, but I like the Flare Gun. Personally, I now use its cousin, the Detonator. If things are far away and you've nothing better to be doing, lob shots. Maybe you'll get lucky and light their Sniper on fire or something. As for your melee weapons, just try and not pick something that gives an active bonus even when you're holding the flamethrower. My personal favorite is the Powerjack.<br/><br/>Step 5: Walk around burning things. Seriously, this is what you're good at. Everything else is gravy. You're a murder machine, just get up and kill them all.<br/>M1+W indeed.<br/><br/>Hope this helped someone. If you're an aspiring Pyro, I have a spare Powerjack free for the first person who wants one (no longer away, offer still open)! If we have any Spies that want an Ambassador I have a couple, but I'm mostly saving this stuff. I have a 2011 Christmas Secret Saxton present I'll be giving away at some point though, probably pretty early! Happy burning.<br/>Mmmph-mmmnhmmphmph!!!<br/>(p.s. if folks rather I don't have this tell my and I'll remove it - I just wanted to give some info on the parts of Pyro that aren't just mindless burning)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dr_Stone" title="Dr_Stone"><img alt="Dr_Stone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dr_Stone">Dr_Stone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404487/#Comment_404487" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-24T23:28:32+00:00" title="January 24, 2013 11:28PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd like a powerjack!<br/><br/>I'm not newbie enough to qualify by the rules in this thread, so if you'd rather hold it for a newbie, that's fine.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404489">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404489/#Comment_404489" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-24T23:31:02+00:00" title="January 24, 2013 11:31PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heck no, I've just got a spare.

I have (something like) a fire axe as a melee weapon, it's supposed to be good for hitting people who are on fire whatever it is, only I'm useless at swapping to it so it's probably not that much use. I have no idea if it's causing me problems carrying it, I should probably check considering how little I use it.<br/><br/>On compression blasts, I've also had maps where a pyro has stood in the right sort of spot and just blasted people off the side of the world, which was very frustrating as the person being blasted so I guess must have been a worthwhile tactic.<br/><br/>In the tutorial world, interested in what a good loadout for the medic is. I think my melee is the only bit I've managed to customise so far and I have a choice between a saw that gives out healing when you do a taunt (which I thought would be cool, but the taunt takes so long it seems a bit pointless) and one that remembers some ubercharge when you die but costs you health (which I think I load with at the moment, but I'm not sure the charge store is worth the health trade off, I figured as I die whatever.

Shooting an enemy with it pretty much sets them on fire. It doesn't do a ton of damage, but that and the detonator are the best things you've got for long range. Your melee is effectively useless most of the time - the big thing it's there for is when you run out of ammo. Most are fine - the big one I know to watch out for is the Back Scratcher as it makes changes to the way you get health regardless of whether you're actually holding it. If your weapon looks like an axe it should be fine. And that Powerjack is available again, so let me know if you want it.<br/><br/>Yeah, the blast is incredibly useful if you learn it - it's probably the most nuanced thing a Pyro can do. My flamethrower of choice (the Backburner) takes a whole 50 ammo to shoot a compression blast so I don't do it much, but it's got a lot of uses.<br/><br/>Medic is one of my four weak classes - I'm no good at it (for reference, the others are Spy, Engie, Demoman). My bro loves it though. From my own stuff, my favorite melee weapon for him is The Ubersaw, a bonesaw that swings 20% slower, but when you hit with it it adds 25% Ubercharge. As for what you're using, I don't think the loss of health is worth it - your team needs you alive and healing more than they need that scrap of ubercharge.<br/>If you're up for a pretty crazy change, the various Mediguns are usually quite different. I have a spare Quick-Fix if you like, I don't need it. It heals 40% faster and has a 25% faster Ubercharge rate, can't overheal, lets you move at the speed of faster healing targets (like Scouts), and your ubercharge increases healing rate by 300% and removes movement-impairing effects instead of invincibility. FigureFour is offering a Kritzkrieg, which is a very different type of Medigun.<br/>I don't have one, but the Crusader's Crossbow is a replacement for the Syringe Gun and my brother swears by it. It's a long-range headshotting gun like a sniper rifle. No scope, but lots of power apparently.<br/><br/>So yeah, if you want that Quick-Fix or Powerjack, hit me up around game time tomorrow and I'll send it your way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo" title="w00hoo"><img alt="w00hoo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/395/nB2PXS15U6BFQ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo">w00hoo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404499/#Comment_404499" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-25T02:24:13+00:00" title="January 25, 2013  2:24AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We'll chat about it tomorrow (I'd feel guilty just hoovering up other peoples stuff :-)  ) bit the Quick-Fix sounds like something I'd use.

I want to get better as a Pyro, so thanks for that! However, I OBJECT!<br/><br/>"The Sentry Gun.<br/>The Sentry Guns set up by Engineers do horrible things Pyros. They can get you at long range, with near-perfect accuracy, and can use explosive rockets at Level 3. Engineers hate everything you do since you're great at busting up support structures like Dispensers, but Sentry Guns tear you up."<br/><br/>Speaking as an Engineer main, you misunderstand the Sentry Gun. That Sentry Gun is your BEST FRIEND, you just don't know it.<br/><br/>You might not be good at busting up sentries, but you're AMAZING at protecting them. Almost as good as an Engineer.<br/><br/>There are three things that Engineers and sentries hate:<br/><br/>1. Explosive spam. Which you can airblast away.<br/>2. Ubered people. Which you can airblast away.<br/>3. Spies. Which you can KILL WITH FIRE. Also, if you're running the Homewrecker, you can even remove their sapper after you kill them, in case I'm too dead to do so myself.<br/><br/>An Engineer might be the king of defense, but just like any other class, they can't do their job ALONE. And there's no one better at helping an Engineer than a Pyro. (Well, maybe a second Engineer...)<br/><br/>Also, when talking about point coverage, remember the airblast. You can even cover a point OFFENSIVELY by airblasting off the opposing team while you cap! Remember, the game isn't about killing, it's about controlling space. The airblast is a tool for controlling space.<br/><br/>The Flare Gun is actually effective long range harassment if you're a good shot with it. It only does about 30 damage (I think), but it sets people on fire, which is annoying. It ALSO gets CRITICAL HITS on anyone who's on fire... Then it does 90 damage. That means 120 damage in two shots. That'll put a lot of classes at the point where the burn damage will kill them if they don't get heals FAST. Even if you don't get the kill, you're going to make that guy fall back, and it only takes two hits.<br/><br/>Oh. Also, not to rain on your full moon happy party, but EVERY day is Halloween Day on MY server!<br/><br/>Now, Medics!<br/><br/>The Vitasaw (hang on to 20% Ubercharge when you die, but have less health) is pretty good. It's actually what I'm running at the moment.<br/><br/>Ubercharge is one of the Medic's most important jobs, and getting Uber faster is better. Nothing sucks like dying with 90% charge and having to start from 0.<br/><br/>I don't find the health loss too concerning. Medics self heal and generally get first dibs on health packs (Seriously, if you grab the health kit when there's an injured Medic around, you're a jerk. Let the Medic take the health kit. Then the Medic will heal YOU. Keep your Medic alive so they can build Uber!) so they're usually not worried about gradual damage, and the really dangerous stuff (crit rockets, sticky traps, ambush heavies, snipers, spies...) were going to kill you in one hit anyway.<br/><br/>If you don't like the health loss, the Ubersaw is your next best choice. You'll rarely use it, but when you do, 25% uber is a BIG DEAL!<br/><br/>The Crusader's Crossbow is pretty fun. It DOESN'T headshot, but it DOES do damage proportionally to the distance to the target. The further away, the more damage. It also HEALS friendly targets when you shoot them! I find it's good at encouraging beginner Medics to STAY AWAY FROM THE FIGHTING, by giving you something to do at range. It's also pretty lethal at long range.<br/><br/>Sometimes a scout will get all up in your face and you'll miss your needles though.<br/><br/>It's also cool because if you use it along side the Amputator (that saw that gives you the healing taunt) it increases your self heal rate! That's the REAL benefit to the Amputator.<br/><br/>The Quick Fix is generally considered pretty crap. I doesn't overheal. Overheal is important. It's uber doesn't make you invulnerable (it just heals really fast). Invulnerability is important.<br/><br/>It's not TERRIBLE, and can be used for some interesting tricks, but the stock Medigun is probably better. The Kritzkreig is good, but situational. It gives your heal target critical hits on all their shots, instead of making them invulnerable. You're both HIGH PRIORITY TARGETS when it's up, but a Demoman, or a Heavy, or a Soldier can kill an entire team if you surprise them with it. (Pyros will deal LOTS of damage with Kritz, but you'll have to be WAY close and you're NOT invulnerable. Best avoided.)<br/><br/>Medic loadouts are actually very preference based. The stock Medigun is probably the "best", and the stock Bonesaw is the worst, but there's a lot of choice available depending on your style.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour" title="FigureFour"><img alt="FigureFour" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour">FigureFour</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404537/#Comment_404537" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-25T10:53:35+00:00" title="January 25, 2013 10:53AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh.

I meant <i>enemy</i> Engineers hate you for that. I'm aware of the wonderful things we can do as partners <img alt=":3" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/blush.png" title=":3"/> And I'm looking forward to supporting. <br/><br/>I've never been particularly great at airblasting. I usually either forget it's there or can't time it right. That's the main reason I love the Backburner - I don't reach for the airblast too much so the bonus damage is worth it. I'm thinking if I intend to do any real major defense work I'll be switching to the default.<br/><br/>Generally once the guy's on fire I can't hit accurately with the flare gun. Since it's my primary ranged support, I've been using the Detonator instead since even at long range I can hit a pretty good area. But yes, the flare gun is great.<br/><br/>That ain't raining on my parade - it just means I can Halloween parade <i>every day</i>!<br/><br/>And yeah, you know Medic more than me. I'm working off the basic stuff my bro mentioned - he claimed he was headshotting, which I guess he was just talking metaphorically. But yeah, everything you said jives with my understanding of it. <br/>In my own estimation, yeah, the Quick-Fix ain't that great. Doesn't mean the offer of a Quick-Fix is gone. More options is always nice, even if they're pretty situational options.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404549">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour" title="FigureFour"><img alt="FigureFour" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour">FigureFour</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404549/#Comment_404549" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-25T12:39:40+00:00" title="January 25, 2013 12:39PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interestingly enough, I was considering playing Pyro instead of Engineer! I'd like to get some Pyro practice in, and with small teams of largely new players, a Sentry Gun might just be obnoxious.<br/><br/>I could always play a Gunslinger Engineer though! (Although, they benefit much less from Pyro support, since the mini-sentry is basically expendable.)<br/><br/>The Detonator is probably the "next best thing" to the Flare Gun. It does less damage to a single target, but lets you set groups on fire, or set someone who's hiding behind a corner on fire, so it's even BETTER for harassing and annoying the enemy team.<br/><br/>It also still does mini crits, so those second hits do like 45 damage instead of 30. Not great, but better than the Scorch Shot!<br/><br/>(For noobs.)<br/><br/>The Scorch Shot is the THIRD flare based Pyro weapon. It's even further down the "less of a threat but more annoying" scale. After it hits, it bounces around for a second, allowing it to hit secondary targets. It also causes knockback, so it's even MORE annoying when spammed into a group. The damage it deals is pathetic though.<br/><br/>Learning to airblast seems to be what makes a REALLY good Pyro. I know it's SUPER HARD to get those SICK REFLECT kills, or those TOTALLY AMAZING reflected rocket jumps! (I still can't believe that there are Pyros who can actually do that! You can reflect a rocket AT YOUR OWN FEET, and surf the explosion like a rocket jumping Soldier in order to close range on the guy who shot the rocket at you!) However, airblasting seems to pay off even if used clumsily.<br/><br/>When you're burning a dude, try airblasting him. Worst case scenario, you'll throw off their aim and make your own survival more likely. (Very important against Heavies! Circle strafing them is fun, but if the Heavy has good tracking, or the foresight to try to shoot in front of you, you'll die in a quarter of a second... Throw off their aim!) Once you've got a feel for it, you can even push people into corners or away from escape routes so that you can keep burning!<br/><br/>Medic was actually the first class I got good at (great class for beginners), so I know them moderately well. The Crusader's Crossbow IS sort of a sniping weapon, so "headshotting" isn't really far from the truth. You just don't actually get a critical hit from a headshot. (It still looks awesome with the arrow sticking out of someone's head though.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404571">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ampa" title="Ampa"><img alt="Ampa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ampa">Ampa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404571/#Comment_404571" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-25T14:08:23+00:00" title="January 25, 2013  2:08PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hello, just signed up to Story Games and discovered this thread <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Hope to be around to play later - steam name: AmpaSteam<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404572">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour" title="FigureFour"><img alt="FigureFour" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour">FigureFour</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404572/#Comment_404572" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-25T14:10:45+00:00" title="January 25, 2013  2:10PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kick ass!
