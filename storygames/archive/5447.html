So, let's all describe moral choices which we think are difficult.<br/><br/>Note: Please don't take sides on your dilemma, just state it.<br/><br/>1. A great author dies, with firm instructions to his son that his last manuscript should be burned, even though the son, having read it, thinks it contains some of his father's most transcendent writing.
