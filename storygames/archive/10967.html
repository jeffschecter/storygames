If I ask what's up and get "Nothing" as an answer, I won't keep pushing it at the expense of all the other non-annoyed people who also paid to play this game.<br><br>I might try to salvage things indirectly within the game, by throwing different kinds of stuff at the annoyed guy to see if he responds to any of it; if he does, problem solved, he's back to playing.  If he doesn't respond to any of it, I might look to see if he's pissed off at someone else at the table, and if I can put pressure on that person to stop doing whatever's causing the problem.  (Assuming that I agree that this other person is being rude; I might not, in which case the annoyed guy is out of luck.)  <br><br>And that's about where I'd leave it.  If these were my friends and this was an ongoing game, I would be willing to go to the wall to make things work out, but for a con game?  No way.<br/><br/>And hey, maybe someone who is <i>that</i> passive-aggressive and <i>that</i> touchy just shouldn't be going to cons; he should grow a thicker skin or learn how to solve his own problems before spending his cash on something that's practically guaranteed to annoy him.

Maybe that's just how they are.   Maybe they suffer from chronic pain issues and this makes them act in ways that seem grumpy/annoyed?

If I am not having a good time or something has gone wrong in a convention game for me, I am not going to slow the game down or shit on other people's fun to have a therapy session about my feelings. I will probably pull back from the game, though, and suffer in silence. Sorry guys, there's nothing wrong with doing that that. As the GM, I'd say just keep going. Usually after a session I'll talk about it depending on whether I think the GM is actually interested in hearing it.<br/><br/>For home games I put the brakes on things.

I agree it depends on context, but IME 90% of the time when a stranger is truly annoyed at an RPG table (and not just projecting frustration as annoyance), it's a bullshit passive-aggressive play for attention or spotlight time. It's poisonous to the whole social dynamic. So, in my own experience I find it always, always the right answer to give the annoyed <i>one shot</i> at clearing the air, and then ignore the aggrieved party and then go out of my way to reward good behavior via attaboys.<br/><br/>Maybe I have some baggage attached to this (from many years of running demos and other con games), but real live "annoyance" in the context of sitting around a table pretending to be elves inevitably points toward bad behavior.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_243256">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243256/#Comment_243256" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-23T08:45:25+00:00" title="November 23, 2009  8:45AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jen,<br/>\n  Yeah, I have been that guy.

It's not a passive agressive play for attention either. I've occasionally had players get worked up over something, get upset over how something turned out, and then disengage from the campaign, and shut down any attempt to talk about it. Often, it's because they;ve understood something in a different way to me - something looks worse to them than it looks to me. Any attempt to discuss it tends to make things even worse. (Which may say something about my conflict management skills... Or it may be to paraphrase someone else, whatever happened in the player's head is none of my business.)<br/><br/>Experience has taught me that a very good way to handle this is do what Luke and Simon said - basically, ignore it, give the player some space, continue playing, and give that player opportunities to engage with the game again without forcing it. This has worked for me every time - the player soon gets back into it and whatever happened is left behind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_243276">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243276/#Comment_243276" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-23T10:16:36+00:00" title="November 23, 2009 10:16AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 23, 2009 10:18AM by Eric.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Reposted from reddit:\n<blockquote>"I want to explain this in a way that makes sense in a very roundabout<br/>fashion so you understand why the answer that a woman ends up with is<br/>"Nothing" when you ask that particular question.<br/><br/>Think of a woman as a robot who has been programmed by society but<br/>somewhere underneath it all, possesses a genuine intelligence. (I can<br/>make this metaphor because it's really true to some extent of guys AND<br/>girls, metaphorically. I'm not putting down my gender or anything.)<br/><br/>The woman has feelings. Sometimes she gets upset. Her sensory intake<br/>is so vast that frequently her emotions can jolt into high gear<br/>remarkably faster than her brain can get the sensory message and<br/>inform her conscious mind of why she's upset. Once she begins to<br/>experience a feeling, her sensory input multiplies her feelings before<br/>she's even consciously aware of them, because they're working so fast.<br/><br/>When she does become consciously aware of them, it's already<br/>telegraphed in the rest of her body. This generally the point at which<br/>a guy asks "What's wrong?" She has only just become aware of her<br/>feelings via her hardware.<br/><br/>At this point her software (social expectations) kick in. This is why<br/>some women can immediately say what's wrong where many others will say<br/>"Nothing." etc. Some women have great software.<br/><br/>If they have not-so-great software, their intelligence attempts to<br/>interpret their sensory information. If they can't yet interpret it,<br/>the default answer is "Nothing" as nothing has yet been established as<br/>"wrong."<br/><br/>In social situations/in front of other people, the software classifies<br/>what's wrong as "nothing" temporarily, as the software frequently has<br/>a caveat that it never admits to having a problem in public, because<br/>if in public, nothing is wrong. Wrong is defined as a state of being<br/>that occurs only in private.<br/><br/>The most insidious version of this - that happens before a woman can<br/>even think about it - is her software has been programmed to not<br/>recognize the problem. So in a sense, it is erring without knowing its<br/>erring. When a woman encounters a situation in which she feels upset<br/>and knows why, but has been programmed to identify the reason as not<br/>an appropriate cause of being upset (and in some cases if she knows<br/>YOU don't think it's a problem that can/should cause her to be upset),<br/>then technically nothing is wrong. She is feeling upset, but her<br/>software refuses to allow her to identify the cause, because its<br/>already identified as a non-cause.<br/><br/>The circular logic (at the speed of light) goes like this: What is<br/>wrong? (blank) is wrong. (blank) cannot be wrong. Nothing must be<br/>wrong.<br/><br/>And then before she's even had the chance to circumvent this,<br/>"Nothing" comes out of her mouth.<br/><br/>Of course, later, you have to deal with her intelligence that wanders<br/>around her psyche fixing things and saying, well, SOMETHING must be<br/>causing this error, let's try redefining this as a potential problem<br/>source and experimentally fix it. This is why four hours later, you'll<br/>have to have a conversation about what's wrong, even though she told<br/>you nothing was wrong.<br/><br/>I think it would help if you considered the "Nothing" as "EMOTIONS DO<br/>NOT COMPUTE! ERROR! ERROR!" Because I'm pretty sure that's mostly what<br/>it means."</blockquote>\nSo, yeah, one more vote against the notion that "nothing" = "passive aggressive bullshit."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_243280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243280/#Comment_243280" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-23T11:08:34+00:00" title="November 23, 2009 11:08AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it depends on how one says "Nothing." <br/><br/>You can say it casually, like, "it's my problem; nothing is wrong that you need to be concerned with; sorry that it became obvious at the table."
