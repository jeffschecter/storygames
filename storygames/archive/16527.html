Maybe there's a point to it, but I doubt it. There's a risk of Identity Politics, but I'll try to steer clear of it.<br/><br/>It's kinda funny. I used to consider myself very "Nordic". I'm Swedish, born and bred, and apart from brief spells abroad, the longest one being just a year, I've spent all my life in Sweden. I've played RPGs since I was a little kid, and I've been very active in the national roleplaying scene in Sweden, publishing several (small-press) RPGs myself, having thousands of posts on Sweden's largest RPG forum, having visited and played at many conventions etc.<br/><br/>And every time I see the word "Nordic" on an English-speaking forum like this one, I get really curious. This world is so strange and exotic, unlike anything I've played in boring old Sweden. I once got a chance to play a Jeepform game once, at a convention, which was interesting, because I'd read about Jeepform briefly on Story Games (I've never heard of it in Sweden). It was a really interesting and intense experience. I felt like I was trying out some new experimental American artform. Jeepform will always feel American to me. Jeepform is that weird stuff people like Jason Morningstar and Emily Care Boss are experimenting with. The only things I've read of it has been in English (I've read the home page of Vi \xe5ker jeep, but it's in English, too!). Same thing with "Nordic LARP". I've never LARPed, which is probably why I've never come into contact with this community.<br/><br/>So what's my tradition? Well, it's what I've always seen as the Swedish role-playing tradition. It began with Drakar och demoner, a Swedish BRP-based fantasy RPG, very like other fantasy RPGs of the early 80's. There are lots of traditional games (some with some international renown, like Kult), but they're changing a lot nowadays. And there's a thriving small-press community, which is influenced a lot by the Forge and its theories, but there's a lot of local specialties, and Swedish small-press games feel quite different from the English-speaking indie scene. The scene I grew up on was and still is located around the web forum rollspel.nu, Sweden's largest online RPG community (I think?). We've got our own theory. There's stuff like the Rising RPG triangle (yeah, we've got a triangle like everyone else), based around Performance, Enactment and Collaborative Storytelling. There are Banana Description games, there's Impro Gaming (related to the Mushin Manifest), there are the old Dogma games, the three types of Strategic Handling (Resource, Risk and Capacity), the Flow-er Model and so on and so on.<br/><br/>So what's my point? I don't know. This Nordic movement has kinda redefined the word "Nordic" to me, which is an odd feeling. I don't consider myself Nordic anymore, at least where roleplaying is concerned. Which is a really weird feeling, identity-wise. This is not something I'm angry about or anything. In fact, I think those crazy Nordics are doing some interesting stuff. I guess it has made me feel more "Swedish" as my RPG-related identity marker. Because the Nordic scene is largely an English-language phenomenon (at least documentation-wise), which still makes it very non-Swedish (and non-Danish, non-Finnish, etc.) to me. So that's my rant, about how the word "Nordic" has come to be associated with "American" more than with "Swedish" in my mind. It's a crazy combination of international language and non-geographic communities. I guess that's how identity works in the 21st century?<br/><br/>I'd love to hear thoughts from the Swedes and Norwegians I know hang around on these forums. Anyone else feel like this?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_378645">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378645/#Comment_378645" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-16T10:24:39+00:00" title="May 16, 2012 10:24AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see where you come from.

As in, the stuff being bandied about as Nordic/Scandinavian on Story Games is very much my stuff, stuff we're trying to get into English so we can share it beyond the Danish/Swedish/Norwegian language community of mutual comprehensibility. But then, that's probably because I'm a Fastaval person, and "Nordic" in the international roleplaying sense seems to be bound up with the (not entirely homogenous) communities around Fastaval (this would include the jeep core), Solmukohta/Knutepunkt, and the big artsy larps.<br/><br/>There are loads and loads of Danish roleplayers, most I believe, who wouldn't identify with "Nordic".

And what's interesting here, to me, is that I've long considered myself to be in one of these subsubcultures. Like, I'd certainly identify my style of gaming more with the term "modern" than "traditional" (these are loaded terms, but I'm using them because Tomas did). I've published three games, working on my fourth, and three of these are straight-up "GM-less", the fourth being "Looks like a GM but isn't". The last game is close to "structured GMless freeform", and I'd certainly classify some of my games as "artsy". And I can say similar things about others in that community. I'm not saying this to go "We're cutting edge!". Rather, to say that there's a lot more going on than "traditional" and "modern". There has been more than one revolution.<br/><br/>Man, I'm really trying to not come off as defensive here. I hope I'm succeeding.

I had a discussion with Tobias Wrigstad once where he said "jeep is just a brand". <br/><br/>So I guess Nordic is the new jeep.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_378734">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378734/#Comment_378734" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-17T00:04:20+00:00" title="May 17, 2012 12:04AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simon, yes I recognize not being "Nordic" even if I live here. And yes, being Nordic seems to basically mean Fastaval &amp; Jeep.  I guess that's because the people who came here from the left side of the pond ended up in those circles.  Had they ended up at GothCon or Sn\xf6Kon playing in the Nordic style would have meant entirely different things.

At that time, my first role-playing game, Draug, was published. It's about Norwegian folklore, and was started while I lived in Australia and thought about Norway.<br/><br/>As a Norwegian game designer, I believe you more or less <i>have</i> to address this issue somehow. RPGs come from the U. S., and Norway is one of the happiest lap dogs America could wish for; the immersion and assimilation of American culture is incredible once you start thinking about it. Still, we have our own cultural traits and history, and the idea of a national identity is strong. I'm writing this on the 17th of May, our national constitution day, which looks like <a href="http://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/17._mai_%28grunnlovsdag%29" rel="nofollow">this</a>. I've been out waving flags and singing songs about Norway with my kids, about how wonderful our country is and how much we love it. You know, the usual. <br/><br/>So it's necessary, somehow, to find an identity to cling to. And this affects our games - especially how we <i>market and present</i> them. All cultures and subcultures are defined in contrast to others, and one of the ways we have of building a strong community is to claim, over and over again, that we are not like you. We are part of the Nordic Scene! We are not Americans!<br/><br/>And once you start saying it, it becomes true. <br/><br/>In 2004, I was very opposed to Pohjola and others using the term "Nordic Scene". I was not part of that scene, and did not see that it existed. It consisted of a few score people talking about each others' games and claiming they were the best in the world - much like Western Mass, really. To begin with, I posited myself as an outsider; I criticized the concept of a Nordic Scene, and wrote harsh reviews of the Knutepunkt books and their elitist and empty posturing. Which is still present, and still something that can be criticized. <br/><br/>I started touching with the larp community when I made "Agabadan" with Espen Nodeland and Erlend Eidsem Hansen. Erlend was one of the people who started the Knutepunkt tradition. Once again, I was welcomed and became part of something I had been criticizing from the outside: The Nordic larp community. Many key players of the community joined the game, and I started to become familiar with the names.<br/><br/>After a while, I decided I had to go to Knutepunkt myself and see what went on. I admit to becoming a convert. They assimilated me. My article "Stop saying immersion!" was a small hit, and I got to talk to and play with <i>so many</i> interesting people. Alien, cool, geeky, beautiful and strange. <br/><br/>Still critical of things, I decided I wanted to make a different Knutepunkt book - kill the dry academia and the posturing; demand engaging articles, actual interesting reads. That succeeded only partly, but in co-editing "Larp, the Universe and Everything", I found myself - obviously - more and more part of the Nordic scene. Around the same time, I edited "N\xf8rwegian Style", which aimed at getting Norwegian tabletop RPGs known in the US and internationally. I was jealous of the attention Danish and Swedish games were getting, and wanted to show that I and my friends also made cool games. Actively branding us as exotic was a conscious decision, to make us stand out from the crowd. We said as much in the book - is there a N\xf8rwegian Style? There is now, because we made this book.<br/><br/>I believe that as soon as someone puts a label on themselves and their community, they define a brand. Like the Impressionists (who just took over a label that was originally meant as an insult). This is what others have done with the Nordic Scene brand. I still hesitate to use the term; I see it as vague, and it's not my brand - I feel I can't control it, and don't like being part of huge groups that someone else controls for their own purposes. (I have the same problem with religion).<br/><br/>So. I think it is symptomatic that I've never heard the term "Nordic Scene" spoken in a Scandinavian language, nor do I recall seeing it in writing except for in English. It is something we say to build community and distinguish ourselves from you Americans. That's why the term is in English - that, and that nobody understands Finnish except for the Finns, so we need to speak English to each other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_378753">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378753/#Comment_378753" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-17T05:30:48+00:00" title="May 17, 2012  5:30AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for posting this, Simon. \n<blockquote>I once got a chance to play a Jeepform game once, at a convention, which was interesting, because I'd read about Jeepform briefly on Story Games (I've never heard of it in Sweden). It was a really interesting and intense experience. I felt like I was trying out some new experimental American artform. Jeepform will always feel American to me. </blockquote>\nI really did learn it from Swedes! But of course, it changes and morphs as it is adopted. I think of the live stuff we are doing as related to Swedish and Danish freeform. And as Matthijs says, our damn cultural hegemony is funny. Even when we adopt stuff from over the pond, it then seems like it's more American imperialism when it continues to spread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_378766">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner" title="Evan_Torner"><img alt="Evan_Torner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/278/nHOYP3VNJB6A6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner">Evan_Torner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378766/#Comment_378766" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-17T07:55:06+00:00" title="May 17, 2012  7:55AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Huge post stupidly lost (because I'm not on my laptop).<br/><br/>Basically:<br/><br/>There has always been a cultural interchange between European/Nordic and American game tropes, but sometimes we call attention to it using labels that then melt under our fingertips. "Nordic scene" is just a construction, a thing to think with, not a thing with major social weight.<br/><br/>Also - personal connections like Emily Care Boss &lt;-&gt; Tobias Wrigstad &lt;-&gt; Frederik J.
