It's common to consider your character as a kind of avatar, with which you inject yourself into the game world. That avatar is rarely a perfect transcription of your own personality. Some traits are emphasised, some softened and some even invented whole-cloth, because it might be fun to act like that for a while. It is after all one of the reasons people give when asked what it is that appeals to them about roleplaying. The character becomes a kind of second skin players put on, so they themselves can delve into the fictitious game world. <br/><br/>I think, it's just as legitimate to play an RPG without such close identification with the character or to not use close identification as the basis for the experience. In fact, such an approach is not any better or worse than the one which ties the character's personality and experiences close to that of the player. The two are perfectly compatible, actually. Most groups have dabbled in both at some point, anyway. Pretty much every decision made in the interest of the entire group or in regards to the logic of the events so far, is doing just that. It's switiching between "what would I do?" (sitting at a table chatting with friends) with "what would the character do?" (who might be in the middle of some questionable acts in pursuit of a greater goal of some kind). <br/><br/>From there it's no great leap (and by no means a necessary one either) to look at the characters and the events they are involved in as a story. Some enjoy this story as a nice but non-essential byproduct of playing the game. Others choose to divert their attention from handling the rules (in the sense of engaging the game aspect of the RPG) to creating an involving <br/>story for everybody at the table. In most cases though groups move around in the area in-between the two, doing a <br/>little bit of this and a little bit of that. <br/><br/>It's been my experience that every group that wants to pursue this story-focus in their gaming will eventually come into <br/>conflict with some of rules in the gamebook. Using houserules is one way of adapting the results of certain rules to one's <br/>personal preference. This way the group can finetune the game to be more cinematic/realistic/gritty/etc. But there are also <br/>many who object so heavily to the results such rules lead to, that they attempt to use them as rarely as possible preferring  to use other means to figure out what happens next. Most people opt to get involved in the nebulous but widely admired art of "just roleplaying it". <br/><br/>I have some difficulties with this, mostly because so much can be labelled as "just roleplaying it". It might be group consensus based on the engagement with the story. It might just as well be arbitrary decision-making masquerading as 'plausibility' or 'realism'. The latter is something that bothers me a little. There is an approach to "just roleplaying it" (often simply meaning that you directly affect the gameworld without employing some kind of abstracted mechanism) which I do find quite appealing. One which is tied to a very specific view of a game's rules and how they are to be invoked at the game <br/>table.<br/><br/>In most cases rules are thought of as a means to determine whether the things that a player wants to happen in the game-world actually occur. You can think of rules as a sieve which is used to sift through the various things players suggest their characters do and only letting a select few of them actually happen in the game-world. The GM will usually determine when and how the rules will be invoked and is often responsible for translating the results into actions in the game-world. If you approach rules this way, "just roleplaying it" is a substitute for this sieve made of rules. You first determine what is to be "roleplayed", then characters will interact, which is then evaluated by one or more players at the table before being accepted as part of the game-world. "Roleplayed" actions are established in the game-world after successfully arguing for them. (I use quotation marks only to emphasise this specific meaning of roleplaying in my post.)<br/><br/>A different approach, which I consider far more compatible with a focus on the story side of an RPG, is one where the rules <br/>are instead used as a palette players draw from to shape the story. "Just roleplaying it" is no longer a substitute or an alternative to using the rules, but instead the central activity around which everything revolves. Additionally you don't need to argue for or otherwise convince others of whatever is roleplayed this way. As long as you can count on the group sharing your appreciation of the story, you can roleplay anything you see fit. Rules here are instead used to introduce a random element into the proceedings and thus make the story more dynamic and unpredictable. Some ways of doing this is by swapping the role of Narrator around or putting constraints of theme or content on the roleplaying person.<br/><br/>Here it often becomes necessary for one or more players to be skilled in handling the story's momentum. Some games give you formal characteristics to help you recognize when the story needs a new impulse (cf. Primetime Adventures' scene conflicts) others leave it in the hands of the GM (e.g. InSpectres and stress rolls). When to invoke the rules or 'system' in such a case is often a very hazy issue. Since it has a lot to do with both picking up on the general mood at the table as well as having an eye for ...dramaturgy, I guess, it's not easy to help new or less experienced players hit their stride. Because it's not about codifying or laying down the definitive principles of good story-gaming, but about helping people find and develop their own style, which still has to be adaptable enough to work in different games. <br/><br/>Managing the momentum of a thrilling action show in PTA, does not work the same way as getting the most out of the tragedy in a Polaris game, the black humour in Shab-Al-Hiri Roach or maybe the rom-com giddyness in Breaking the Ice. I think there is a great range of helpful advice for story games waiting to be put in words. I just have no idea how. <br/><br/>Comments? Ideas?

It's a subject I was discussing with Judson Lester at Gateway last weekend.<br/><br/>(In fact, I was just thinking about this as I was waking up this morning!  I'm like that...)<br/><br/>Whether it's called dramaturgy, techniques, or story-skills or whatever, there are these "gaps" in getting the game going that a game's rules<i> can't</i> handle.  <br/><br/>Sometimes the game is narrow, as the rules add in lots of details to carry the group through many of these decisions.  Other times the gap is very wide.  <i>Primetime Adventures</i>, for example, has nothing but story-techniques for minutes on end, and then boom! -- play cards.... and then you're thrown back on nothing but story-techniques for another minute or two.  Note this doesn't mean that the players are just making stuff up out of any ol' thin air.  The game's rules have provided a structure: the show's premise and the Issue of each character, for example, are there for the Players to use and focus on.  By focusing on them, certain ideas will be generated that are still varied in their possibility, but will carry a certain creative weight so that they are "right in a way that wouldn't be possible if the Player narrating an outcome simply ignores them. <br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Georgios</cite>I think there is a great range of helpful advice for story games waiting to be put in words. I just have no idea how.</blockquote>\nI agree.  As a side-project, I'm currently preparing a booked called, "Narrative Techniques for Games" which, in my dreams, discusses a host of "dramaturgy" techniques -- if you will -- to be used at the game table.  It will be a collection of techniques collected from games and the internet, as well as techniques gathered from improv, dramaturgy, screenwriting, and the writing of fiction.  We're using these skills all the time when we get to the "story" bits of RPGs, and there's no reason we can't do it with purpose and greater confidence.<br/><br/>The "how" part has baffled me for a while, as well.  My solution is to introduce one technique after another, with an essay like introduction, what its used for, how to use it well, and give specific examples from specific moments of play.<br/><br/>While your right that different games have different needs and work differently, I think there's something valuable to be found in knowing what game <i>share</i> in their storytelling needs.<br/><br/>Most importantly, you're right: it is indeed a hazy issue.  However, the thrill of navigating this hazy issues is part of the fun of these games for me.  I want to offer a book that helps people see this thrill and fun as well.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94209/#Comment_94209" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-09T13:17:06+00:00" title="September  9, 2007  1:17PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Georgios</cite>A different approach, which I consider far more compatible with a focus on the story side of an RPG, is one where the rules are instead used as a palette players draw from to shape the story.</blockquote>\nI am far, far more interested in games that give the players a selection of tools to use as they see fit.

I think that this distinction is mostly one of perspective, with the players' approach to the game sort of trumping whatever the designer might have had in mind. On my blog I've written down a short list of games and my experiences with them. I wanted to emphasise how the group, I played the games with, looked at the rules. There was a nice progression from D&amp;D3rd to WFRP2 to Paranoia to Dogs to PTA to InSpectres. On the one side there were games where we used the rules as a kind of story engine, which didn't actually produce story but rather specific events (swords smashing orcs, spells affecting people, traps being disarmed, etc.). On the other side were games where we used the rules more like tools to nudge the flow of the story in one direction or another (calling for stress rolls at the most precarious moment, using spotlights just when things seem to get stale, etc.). <br/><br/>I think playing those games the way we did, is what they seemed to be most suited for. But that doesn't keep anyone from running D&amp;D3rd using the same principles as InSpectres or vice versa. Admittedly, I have my doubts it will actually produce an enjoyable experience, but I'm not the arbitrator of anybody else's fun but my own. Just because I can't imagine enjoying it, doesn't mean others won't.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94359">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94359/#Comment_94359" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-10T10:24:11+00:00" title="September 10, 2007 10:24AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 10, 2007 8:51PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Georgios</cite>I think such a text is a great tool for people who already feel somewhat comfortable if not confident to put the main focus on the story side of the game.

That's an intellectualized debate about abstractions that you'll never win.  The trick is to say, "OK, here's your <i>Primetime Adventures</i> character sheet.  The first thing is we need to come up with a concept for a show..."  and go from there.  You focus on that concept for the show.  After that is done yous say, "You need a concept for the characters."  Then once that is done, you say, "Okay, every character needs an Issue..." and so on.<br/><br/>Each of these is "soft" techniques when compared to "Roll a d20 and get under your strength."  But they are ALL specific concrete techniques used in the creative act of making narrative in any form.  (Coffee and lattes are optional.)<br/><br/>By pointing the person's brain at one of these "Focus" points after another, you move forward.  You're not trying to convince anyone it works, you're just <i>doing</i> it.  In scene work, if things start to get muddled, the Producer or a player says, "Hey wait, what's the focus of the show?  What's the character's Issue?  Let's make sure to drive toward that, let's focus on that."  That's the dramaturgy you mentioned above.  And no one is getting confused along the way about whether it's <i>going</i> to work or not, because they're brain is occupied with focusing on the matter of the Show's Concept, the Character's Concept, the Character's Issue or whatever.  <br/><br/>Now, you might get someone at the table who wants to fight, I suppose.  You might say, "Okay, first we come up with the show's concept."<br/><br/>And someone might balk, slamming his hand on the table, standing fiercely, knocking his chair out from behind him and declare, "You mean you don't even know what you're <i>RUNNING</i>!?!"<br/><br/>A couple of points about that:<br/><br/>1) I would say, "This is how we play this game.  You can sit down and join us in coming up with the concept, or you can leave.  And I'd hate for you to leave.  But this is how we play this game."<br/><br/>2) My guess is, if you don't explain what's <i>going to happen</i>, and instead focus on <i>what's happening right now</i> moment by moment ("Now do this, now do this, now do this..."), they'll be caught up in making up the fun stuff before they even know that they should have been confused and contrary till after it's too late.  So, don't give them the chance to gear up. Just start turning everyone's brain on one specific creative act after another.<br/><br/>3) Short of that, you'll never CONVINCE someone who doesn't want to take the risk or want to do it.  That's just the truth.  If they signed up for the wrong game, they signed up for the wrong game.<br/><br/>4) I've also really been lucky, I supposed.  At Gateway last weekend I was playing all sorts of games that literally bear no resemblance to old school texts.  No one squeaked.  There was confusion, of course.  Rules for <i>PtA</i> and <i>Shock</i> might throw people for a loop.  But everyone arrived at the table to play the kinds of games that were delivered.  There was a lot of self-selection going on.  So, I'd love to hear more about the circumstances of the con, the promotion of the game, and the game itself.<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/><br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94364">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94364/#Comment_94364" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-10T10:36:57+00:00" title="September 10, 2007 10:36AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite>Joshua: Have you palyed a game which felt like the second because of the designer, not the GM?</blockquote>\nActually, <em>Polaris</em> felt like this.

Not because of the rules, but because of the way the GM manipulates the situation to conform to the expectations of the players. I've done it myself. Pulp action games are particularly prone to this, I've discovered. The expectations is the that the heroes will win and villains will lose. For the GM to allow otherwise to occur invites the wrath of unhappy players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94406/#Comment_94406" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-10T12:53:26+00:00" title="September 10, 2007 12:53PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 10, 2007 12:54PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul,<br/><br/>Yes.

A few years back I was on a boardgame rush and would constantly explain new games to my friends, who'd never really get into the spirit of the game until they knew how all the seperate elements of the game were supposed to work together. They would quiz me about obscure rules combinations before they even really sat down to play. That's why I probably started explaining games starting with the overarching purpose of the game and only then detailing how to get there. <br/><br/>I'll run PTA at a convention this weekend, so I'll give your advice a try.

Which covers everything from small press games to older games and homebrew systems. The pitch I used this year is: "The RPG for people who always wanted to roleplay just like authors write TV shows. Everything's possible here, from BSG to 24 to Sex and the City."<br/><br/>I'm very hesitant to describe this game as story-focussed or story-telling or anything like that, because it's been my experience in German gaming circles that these terms have a very specific connotation. One which leads people to have certain expectations about the game which are usually at odds with how the game plays. Essentially it's what I mentioned earlier about people wanting to "just roleplay it" and therefore wanting to abandon all rules and relying instead on arguments of "realism", genre appropriateness or their acting showmanship to affect the story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94442/#Comment_94442" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-10T14:27:10+00:00" title="September 10, 2007  2:27PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 10, 2007 2:30PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah.  Germany.<br/><br/>That explains a lot from what I've read on several boards about what German gamers in general seem to think is meant by "story" in games -- and why you might have trouble.  "Story games are all about not using rules, hand waving away any logic, the GM having a pre-built story that bores us, or all of us wandering around 'in character' until a story, supposedly, 'just happens'," is what I read all the time.  I can see why that would be complicated!<br/><br/>So, here's what I would recommend.  Don't say anything about story-focused or story-telling or anything like that.  The story will reveal itself in a PtA game or not.  Your only job is to walk them through the steps of Show Creation, Character Creation and Scene Creation.<br/><br/>I can only stress from my experience at Gateway: make sure to get the Issues nailed down well.  Make the Issue that is something trips the character up from getting what they want, it makes them stumble.  It's not a motivation.  It's a behavior.  In a game I ran last Sunday, one character's Issue was <i>Pride</i>, and the other the and the Issue <i>Myopic</i> [about Engineering].  <br/><br/>Then, when you get to scenes, drive toward the Issue.  Throw a conflict at a character that puts the issue on the line.  With Pride, I constantly had other figures of authority arrive and see if the character would blow his stack or stand down.  With the Myopic character, he had a girlfriend, and I kept having her show up and test whether he'd focus on her or his work.<br/><br/>Conflict to me in PtA is beginning to mean, "Putting the Issue on the Line."<br/><br/>It sounds to me like you've had a chance to think all this through in a new way.  I bet you have a great time.  <i>Please</i> come back and tell me how it worked out.<br/><br/>CK<br/><br/>PS remember, people might be scratching their heads afterwards... because not every game is for every person.  But at least they have <i>done it</i> and be able to react to what they've done, rather than reacting to the anticipation of what they <i>THINK</i> they'll be doing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94464">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Georgios" title="Georgios"><img alt="Georgios" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Georgios">Georgios</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94464/#Comment_94464" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-10T15:12:40+00:00" title="September 10, 2007  3:12PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite><br/>That explains a lot from what I've read on several boards about what German gamers in general seem to think is meant by "story" in games -- and why you might have trouble.

Especially when there are people who use this attitude to demonize any and all attempts at story and others who actually praise and admire this kind of driver's seat gaming. I ''fondly'' remember one of the players in my very first PTA game criticizing PTA because it didn't allow her to sit back and be entertained by the GM's story. It can be weird being a story gamer here. <br/><br/>Anyway... I'll give your suggestions a try this weekend. I plan to run PTA, Dogs and Shab-al-Hiri Roach, I'm curious how things play out there.

Some things are impossible in the context of the game, and a good design situates you so you address conflicts and results that <i>are</i> possible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94736">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94736/#Comment_94736" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T12:23:04+00:00" title="September 11, 2007 12:23PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John, I'm right there with you but for the absolutely essential to me caveat that in <em>Polaris</em> you are supposed to make a chivalric knight, who presumably gives a shit about the collapse of civilization, and then you're not allowed to do anything about said collapse.

This seperation between what the player cares about and what the character they control cares about threw a monkey wrench into the game. <br/><br/>Everybody at the game was aiming to save the relationship, even though the game was about something else entirely. All because the characters would want to save the relationship. When it comes to roleplay it seems very natural to tie your own interests to that of the character you control. Stepping away from the character's emotional state and "just acting" appears to be something that some people need to will themselves to do.
