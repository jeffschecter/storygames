I know that I don't, not any longer. And I really don't feel any attachment to square grids, hex grids, or a regular map that you measure distances on. <i>Old School Hack</i>'s implementation of arenas and FATE's implementation of zones...that's where I prefer my map crunch to be, at most.<br/><br/>But minis?<br/><br/>Minis are cool. At least for me they are. I mean--they're little fighters and rogues and mages and monsters, and you paint them up, and they represent your character in a long-running campaign...I think all of that is really, supremely cool. But there's no good reason to have a mini in an RPG.<br/><br/>So now I open the floor up. I know that boardgamey components can really benefit a game; I love how Warhammer 3E did that. <b>Are there good ways to integrate miniatures into games, especially narrative-based games?</b><br/><br/>Ones that I'm currently aware of:\n<ul>\n<li>Warhammer uses them to mark abstract spacing; nice, but it's just Theatre of the Mind+.</li>\n<li>Um, nothing much, really.

With the Everway card, you look at the image and then there are 3 questions on the other side of the card, meant to draw on the art as inspiration in answering them. You do the same exact thing with the miniatures.<br/><br/><b>2) Use the miniatures as a starting point creative constraint, rather than starting with something else and then fighting backwards upstream with your creativity.</b><br/>You will never, ever find a miniature that looks like a character (PC or NPC) who looks exactly like a character you've created beforehand. OTOH, you can pick an interesting miniature, and build a character out of it.<br/><br/><b>3) If you aren't playing a competitive war game or a hardcore simulation, why are you dicking around with a grid or exact measurements? Stop it. Just, just stop it. Seriously.</b><br/><br/>You don't need a grid to do an action scene in Fiasco, and there's no actual reason to use one in more narrative style miniatures play either, beyond Dain Bramage that tells you <i>this is how things have always been done when miniatures are brought out.</i><br/><br/>Just move the things around like you did as a kid with toys before you ever learned miniatures war game traditional mechanics.<br/><br/><b>4) Terrain is a creative constraint also</b><br/>Picking up and putting down terrain regularly is a pain in the ass. Don't do it.  Create your layout ahead of time and flesh it out (in fictional terms) as the fiction is created through play.<br/><br/><b>5) Use what you have, not what you don't.</b><br/><br/>Creative constraints again. Draw your inspiration for events in the session from what is available on the table and in the toy collection at hand. If your layout and toys are all desert themed, don't create a scene and characters that are on a space station in orbit. That's just dumb, and truly counterproductive. Next session, you can bring different stuff and have your space station focused play if that's what you want.<br/><br/><b>6) A table layout is the relevant part of your fictional universe for that session, not one gigantic battlefield. Because you aren't war gaming, that's why.</b><br/>In a verbal rpg/sg where you set scenes, you'd normally name when and where a scene takes place to get things rolling, and who is involved, along with who else might be lurking around. Same idea with using the miniatures. A scene might only take place with a fraction of your table layout. You just visually indicate that before the scene starts. Put down some glass beads to show the boundaries, or just trace the area with your index finger for other folks to see and describe the bounds.<br/><br/>In practice, this means that you can easily have many different locations and sub-locations for scenes to play out, not just one big field.<br/><br/>As a side note, I don't think minis use need be restricted to long running campaigns at all. They're just as interesting for medium length (3-6 hour) one shot sessions, same as many other dirty hippie games.<br/><br/>As just a general philosophical soapbox all of my own, I try to remind people that miniatures wargame play and its off-shoots are a subset of possible imaginative, fiction creating play inspired by toys. It's the one people are most familiar with and the one that has the most structures we can readily look at when we go to the bookshelf. It's far from the only, or even most obvious, direction to take. For more narrative play, bring the toys along, but leave the methods behind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409756/#Comment_409756" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-20T12:02:26+00:00" title="March 20, 2013 12:02PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, those are some <i>fascinating</i> thoughts! I really dig the idea of playing a one-shot inspired by minis that you just pick. I admit, the reason I thought of minis as connected to campaigns was the idea of picking a mini and investing in it, something you'd only do for an ongoing character.<br/><br/>One idea I'd also given thought to was the idea of using minis to track a more abstract "presence" of a character. Not just their physical locations, but--going back to that idea of the relevance of table layout--using the location to say something about the character themselves.

For example, instead of an island, that area over yonder is a ruined castle, and that one over there is the village in. Other than that, a pretty straight forward approach.<br/><br/>Use Rafael's approach for defining key main characters and supporting characters. Any other character miniatures are truly minor, walk-on roles at best, a bit like chatty terrain.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409959">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409959/#Comment_409959" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-21T12:45:43+00:00" title="March 21, 2013 12:45PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Does using them in <i>3:16</i> count, or isn't it narrative enough?

Even with my Star Wars action figure play as a kid, there was lots of plotting and character play and action play emulating stuff from the movies that was usually a lot different from the way a war gamer approaches that stuff.<br/><br/>Once remembered, it really did seem to sync up better with some dirty-hippy approaches I was encountering for the first time.<br/><br/>Here's my dirty secret: I really love the toys, but the way gaming with them is commonly approached really just tends to bore me to tears quickly. I've joined in multiple tabletop miniatures games ( including D&amp;D 4e sessions) where there was seemingly all kinds of cool potential: Beautiful toys, dramatic background, interesting characters with all sorts of built-in minor conflicts of interest and clashing personalities, lots of potential for tricky situations and action built right in.<br/><br/>An hour and a half into play, and I'm starting to feel like a fox caught in a trap; maybe I really ought to just chew off my own paw and make my escape.<br/><br/>So I started looking for a different approach.<br/><br/>Many already existing dirty hippy games can be played with miniatures added with almost no change to the core concepts/mechanics. <i>Universalis</i> was the first dirty hippy game that I personally realized could be used with minis and work just fine. With a customized or tweaked playset, you could even play <i>Fiasco</i> with miniatures and it wouldn't undermine the core essence of the game or turn it into a boring-ass tactical, modifier grubbing, competition-fest. <i>Archipelago</i> can be played with miniatures almost as-is, although I really like Rafael's variation I linked upthread.<br/><br/>The only real changes are just in approach:<br/>1) Draw inspiration for the fictional stuff from the toys, from their appearance (individually and collectively) and use what you have, not what you don't. It's only as constraining as any kind of preliminary set-up is constraining.<br/><br/>2) Show the action with the toys and show location for scenes with the toys. It doesn't absolutely need to be high action all of the time with toys either. Drama and discussion between characters doesn't end just because there are toys involved. If that seems foreign as a concept, rush out to find your young daughter or favorite niece and agree to play Barbies or Breyer horses or Cottage Critters with her one afternoon. It's educational.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410111">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410111/#Comment_410111" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-22T11:23:29+00:00" title="March 22, 2013 11:23AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like these thinkings.

I was hilarious. <br/><br/>* Tilted the table on one side, put Jenga blocks down to make a Labryinth for a large Marble to roll down. If you go hit by the marble, it hurt. This was used to represent a the random water flowing in a destroyed catacomb, waves would flash flood the place in an instant. <br/><br/>* Tacked weights to the bottom of the minis, and stretched a large sheet of paper across to stacks of books and clamped it tight.

The kind of guys that get sent off to far flung reaches of empire when the natives get restless. In my case, this usually means Space 1889 Mars or Venus.<br/><br/>Check out that guy up in the upper left corner. <br/><br/>Now if you're making the fiction first and you need some German colonial military guy as a heavy, well, maybe any of those figures will do. Maybe you won't be satisfied because none of them are quite what you saw in your mind. Heck, maybe you didn't even come up with a situation that called for a German colonial officer. Hell, maybe a jellybean will do the trick for play. After all, you just need a positional marker for combat purposes.<br/><br/>If you're drawing inspiration from the minis, that figure takes on some other uses. <br/><br/>What do you see in him? Well, he's balding, so he's older, maybe a higher ranking officer. He's got a monocle ( ooh, errr- clearly evul!) maybe some kind of aristocrat, and he's got a bottle in one hand and some kind of glass in the other. A fine wine? Schnapps?<br/><br/>He's isn't in uniform though. His jacket is off and his suspenders are hanging loose around his pants. That doesn't look your stereotype of the spiffy Prussian, now does it?<br/><br/>It suggests all kinds of possibilities to me. Is he really evil? Maybe he really does have bad eyesight? How long has he been out at that foreign station? Does he drink because he's refined, or bored, or is he just an old drunkard and that's why he got stuffed in an outpost in the colonies? Does he drink due to some great tragedy or guilt he can't get over? Does he just laze around out of uniform every day? What do his men think about that? His fellow officers?<br/><br/>Just looking at that one guy physically, we can start to throw about some ideas. We can do some of the same stuff with the other figures individually. The guy in the middle top row looks all action-man-ish, leading from the front. The upper right guy looks super spiffy and refined*. On the lower left, out there with binoculars, the guy looks all haughty with hand on hip. Some kind of technical specialist or scout? That stiff looking SOB down on the lower right all at attention, hand on sabre looks like a real trouble maker and maybe a dueling fanatic, and maybe a bit of a young career climber in the making.<br/><br/>Take each of those figures, make up a couple open ended questions based n what you see just like with the first miniature, and then think about them as a whole group, interacting with one another. <br/><br/>Just doing that exercise, even briefly, and we've already got a set up for a more narrative loving approach to a game, even before we add any other characters or put them in some fictional setting with the heat turned up to make it boil.<br/><br/>It's all fiction inspired by just the looking at the miniatures themselves, their poses, and tidbits of gear.<br/><br/>[*Actually, the dapper officer with the cigarette reminds me of Cary Grant, although I couldn't tell you in what role or which movie. Hey, there's some fiction right there! It is Cary Grant! He's playing a British spy posing as a German officer! Man, this shit just writes itself sometimes.]<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410251">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonT" title="JasonT"><img alt="JasonT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonT">JasonT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410251/#Comment_410251" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-23T14:37:22+00:00" title="March 23, 2013  2:37PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been considering adding minis to games that don't require them just to help my players imagine scenes. I find that when we end up in scenes with a pretty large cast (6 PCs plus 4 or more NPCs and/or additional important features), my players often get confused about how many people or things are in the room together. (We get a lot of comments like, "Oh, those aren't the same person?") I've used slips of paper or just simple tokens to help them remember how many people are present, but minis would help it feel more part of the story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410284">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chugosh" title="Chugosh"><img alt="Chugosh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/289/nOED25F16XENN.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chugosh">Chugosh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410284/#Comment_410284" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-23T22:46:44+00:00" title="March 23, 2013 10:46PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's also scenes in a box, called dioramas, I think.  I like miniatures as kind of a character portrait more than as place markers on a map, unless I'm playing a tactical war game in which 3d positioning matters (currently liking "Infinity" though not buying in for now.)  All of my fimo guys are more about that than about use in a setting.<br/>I had an idea once where you would get some of those blind buy lego guys and then randomly open them and make your character based on what you found in the bag.  That could work for any one of these blind buy games, I bet.  My system of choice for that would have been Savage Worlds back then, but now, I do not know.  There are so many good universal systems to choose from, and many with better story elements.  Maybe "Adventure!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410292">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410292/#Comment_410292" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-24T05:30:49+00:00" title="March 24, 2013  5:30AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Cerise website had a great short article on making your own gaming minis from polymer clays like fimo.

I'd love to see someone who really ran with that concept, making that kind of craft part of game creation.<br/><br/>Chugosh, I very much like Mythic GM Emulator for that kind of thing.<br/><br/>I'm always a bit sad when talking about this stuff, because I know what takes me paragraphs to describe online could be shown to people in person easily, and they'd grok it wholesale in all of about five minutes                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
