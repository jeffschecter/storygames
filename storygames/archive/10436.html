It's very hard to understand how to play just through reading the book. But I recently made a new friend who had played before and swore by it. So I thought I should give it a try. I re-read the rules, my friend filled the gaps, another new friend joined our game. I have found the rules actually work very well. It's strength, in short are:<br/>\n<br/>\n-strategy : not in the "what's the optimal power I can use, where should I hit him, can we flank him, 5 foot step, attack of opportunity" kind of strategy, but really a matter of how to get the resources to get the story flying, and to spend the resources before you are overdrawn. And how to succesfully create conflicts and events that grabs your opponents interest so they'll spend their resources right where you want them. You are not left at the mercy of chance in this game, though there is some of that too.<br/>\n<br/>\n-creativity : I'm the kind of guy who compares good roleplaying to a jam session, to improv jazz. And never was it so obvious to me than playing this game (well there was also Universalis, but I have found Capes to be more satisfying; InSpectres was also very much like that and satisfying as well, but Capes was to an even higher level). I have felt very creative that night, and I felt I have built on the creativity of others just as they have built on mine, which is my main motivation for roleplaying. When this doesn't happen (and all too often it doesn't), I tend to feel a bit down, or even a little frustrated, wondering what was the point and whether I was in the right hobby. Games like Capes remind me why I play.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Premisse : Yes, we adress premisse in Capes, and that (for me) keeps the game experience from being hollow. Give me strategy and creativity, but if all we get to do with it is Superman fighting Brainiac with nothing much at stake personally for them, I'll feel like we missed the mark, or we haven't gone as far as we could have. I can't say this particular session has been incredibly deep or challenging, but I believe the potential is there. You can use your powers as much as you want, but each time you do, you take debt, tat you place on your virtues (truth, justice, that stuff). Each virtue has a limit though, and if you exceed that limit, it will impact your play very negatively. So you stake that debt on thematically charged conflicts, those that have a link to the virtue in question. If you succeed, that debt is gone, you feel vindicated in your beliefs. If you fail, you take the debt back, doubled. Power is fun, but do you deserve it?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_232103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232103/#Comment_232103" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-13T13:08:53+00:00" title="September 13, 2009  1:08PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I so want to play this, but the book, alas the book...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_232111">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/oreso" title="oreso"><img alt="oreso" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/oreso">oreso</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232111/#Comment_232111" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-13T14:42:42+00:00" title="September 13, 2009  2:42PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 13, 2009 2:51PM by oreso.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.museoffire.com/Games/downloads.html" rel="nofollow">Fortunately, there's this handy flash demo tutorial thingy</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\nI mean, the book is a decent enough reference tool.

But that mechanism is still pretty complex, and requires a bit of a leap for it to click into place in your head. The REAL introductory tool is <a href="http://www.museoffire.com/Games/Downloads/CapesLite.pdf" rel="nofollow">Capes Lite</a>, the quickstart rules that A) strip down Capes to their basic operations, and <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> include explanatory paragraphs that <i>only introduce rules concept as you encounter them in play.</i> That's key, really: getting used to, say, using a Power, narrating it, then rolling a die, before moving on to something like Staking and Splitting. If you try to gaze upon the many-speldored whole of the Great Machine in its terrible entirety, you'll drive yourself mad.<br><br>As for Capes' strengths: in my experience it really rocks for high-octane, "oh no you didn't" kinda of stories, bursting with bombastic speeches, gritted teeeth, sweat-mopped brows, and grand conflict. The fact that you can narrate anything within the constraints of the conflicts on the table encourages players to go for the gusto--you can narrate a wildly successful and impressive action, and if you roll crap, leave the other player to describe how they equally impressively shrug it off. It's a breath of fresh air from games where whiffing means "I try to do X--whoops, I screw up." And placing the scene's running conflicts on the table means you know exactly what to play to in your heroic (or villainous) struggle.<br><br>The resource system is front and center, <i>definitely</i>--but not in an abstract, play-the-numbers way; all its interactions are welded to comic-panel-sized chunks of story, or tied to specific Heroic or Villainous Drives. For Capes to work well, you have to be committed to <i>caring</i> about the narrative, so that staking points from your Duty drive means something, particularly if you lose and get overdrawn, creating crippling doubts about your heroic responsibility. And the point of the economy is that you throw out conflicts that others care about, so that you can put up a fight in one arena, lose, then use the resulting tokens to win the conflict that <i>you</i> really care about.<br><br>Capes is tons of fun, but definitely takes some deft use of technique to get it to sing.<br><br>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_232392">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232392/#Comment_232392" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-14T23:12:31+00:00" title="September 14, 2009 11:12PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've always thought that Capes Lite was superior to the full game.
