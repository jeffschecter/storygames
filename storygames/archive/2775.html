The last time that I did it was Little Fears, so I'm drawing on that experience.<br/><br/>Black light, if you have one.  Seriously, gaming by black light is an unnerving experience.  Gaming tip:  if you're going to do this, first use a highlighter on all important information on the character sheet.  It glows under a black light and lets you read the necessary information.<br/><br/>Put dolls in the room.  If you're using the black light, color a small dot on the eyes with a highlighter.  Dolls are incredibly creepy.<br/><br/>Low light, as was mentioned.  Glow-in-the-dark dice can help with the dice rolling.<br/><br/>Since our game was in Halloween, we also gave the player little bags of trick-or-treat candy.  That helped the Little Fears vibe quite a bit, although I'm not sure that it would actually help you.<br/><br/>Also, have the environment prepared in advance and enter it as the beginning of play.  Do <i>not</i> let your players into the room to do pre-game socializing.  Otherwise the impact of the environment is greatly reduced.<br/><br/>Put fake blood on your dice.  It's a small thing, but sometimes small things are big things.<br/><br/>Finally, I'll echo Jason's comment about making sure that the players are all on the same page.  I've done this sort of thing successfully with players that <i>wanted</i> to be scared.  Except that one time, where someone showed up who really wasn't interested in the experience.  It turned into a very bad night for her, which was really too bad.  Must have had something to do with the bit where I started drooling fake blood....<br/><br/>Also, in my Call of Cthulhu games, my group agreed to a simple social reinforcer.  Any time someone cracked a joke, someone else in the group got to hit him in the back of the head.  We quickly arrived at the point where a person wisecracking would hit <i>himself</i> in the back of the head.  No one was exempt, not even the GM (he said, rubbing his head).  Now, I'm not actually suggesting this as a rule.  This worked because that's the sort of group that it was, and we arrived at this idea together.  Imposing it from on high...bad.  However, it <i>is</i> a good idea to have a "bad player, no biscuit" sign for someone who is disturbing the Zen.  This sort of horror gaming is very atmosphere-dependent, and the group needs to understand that the atmosphere is everyone's responsibility.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam%20Cerling" title="Adam Cerling"><img alt="Adam Cerling" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.grapevinelarp.com/lantern.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam%20Cerling">Adam Cerling</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63279/#Comment_63279" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-09T08:40:38+00:00" title="April  9, 2007  8:40AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Years ago I used Little Fears' character creation system to set up a diceless Kids-in-Silent-Hill campaign. I was unemployed and had a lot of time to cultivate just the right atmosphere.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a social level, I made sure everyone was there to be scared. I established that I would be running five or six episodes, and I got everyone's commitment to be there. We created characters ahead of time. I asked that people eat dinner before they came, and that they not bring snacks or drinks to the game: I would provide drinks.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I set up the basement. The table was a six-foot long folding table: I had one long side, and the players had the other. Under the table, I placed a lamp with a naked bulb: I liked how it threw our shadows upward against the walls. I also gave the players a flashlight.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor seating, I provided the players with oversized armchairs. For drinks, a pitcher of Kool-Aid with huge tumblers to drink from. I provided stuffed animals and action figures similar to what was listed on the players' "my favorite things" list. These helped contribute to the atmosphere of playing children.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the Silent Hill touches, I got fancy -- I gave them a walkie-talkie, and I had a rig beneath the table to broadcast static through it whenever monsters were drawing near. I acquired the game soundtrack in MP3 and created "low-tension" and "high-tension" playlists: the computer I used was kept inconspicuous. Whenever the kids faced a new monster, I pulled out a large scribbly charcoal-and-red-crayon drawing of it I'd made and taped it to the wall behind me: by the last game, the wall was covered in them.<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, I prepared specific special effects for each episode. I set up the TV in the room to flicker on at one point with "The Shining" playing. I asked one player to take a scissors and physically remove a bullet I'd planted in the head of her stuffed animal. I had a rusty metal prop to represent the MacGuffin they had sought.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm really proud of how well all that worked out in play... but like I said, I was unemployed, so I had lots of time to prepare. There's no way I could find time to do that today!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_63281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DirkGently" title="DirkGently"><img alt="DirkGently" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DirkGently">DirkGently</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63281/#Comment_63281" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-09T09:20:54+00:00" title="April  9, 2007  9:20AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing that you might want to consider, apart from all these awesome mood setting descriptions, is adding some ritualistic touches to your 'game dialogue'. <br>\n<br>\nMore specifically, you might have a 'beginning' phrase that lets everyone know that the time for joking and idle conversation is over (because all the mood in the world can't survive cell phones and gamer jokes)... it doesn't have to be complicated, maybe even saying something like "And this is the way that it was...". If you use this same phrase across multiple sessions it really acts as a Pavlovian bell that says 'Now it is time to get serious'. <br>\n<br>\nIn the same vein, I would suggest a 'break' phrase (something appropriately cliffhangery like "And they were able to rest for a moment, all the while unknowing that the worst was yet to come...") and an 'ending' phrase.<br>\n<br>\nAll configured for your particular story, of course. You may, in the end, find them corny and stop using them... but for my groups they seemed to work really well in triggering the correct mood.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63288">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/urbanpagan" title="urbanpagan"><img alt="urbanpagan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v225/urbanpagan/Other%20Schtuff/urbanpaganavatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/urbanpagan">urbanpagan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63288/#Comment_63288" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-09T09:52:41+00:00" title="April  9, 2007  9:52AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Music always helps set a tone.
