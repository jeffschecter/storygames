All of which were test based over the internet, so it avoided most of that IRL awkwardness.<br/><br/>Mostly fun stuff, I got married to an NPC in one of them, ended up adopting another PC by the end (I was the only adult PC in that one).   Meanwhile, the sole male pilot flitted between the various female pilots and NPC girls from school in a complex love hexagon, before finally getting back together with the one he had his eyes on from the start.  It was a pretty sweet game that lasted for over a year and one of the few games I've been in that we reached a planned ending instead of just going until things lost steam.<br/><br/>In another my raised in a lab clone PC was super critical of another pair of PCs relationship because she was completely convinced it would hamper their dedication to the mission and combat effectiveness (there was a bit of sour grapes going on as well since she was genetically modified to not experience such 'distractions').  GM was dealing with some IRL issues and lost motivation to run that one, but it was fun while it lasted.<br/><br/>However, a third game (that I was GMing) kind of hit some drama because of how it was set up, with the party being 2 brothers and a sister, and one other girl.  The non related girl ended up getting a bit too much focus since she was the most viable romance option for the two brothers, and the love triangle kind of dominated the game.  Everyone got a bit too invested in it, which resulted in some IRL resentment, the brothers, because they both thought THEY should win, and the sister for being mostly ignored as a result. <br/><br/>In retrospect, I should have been doing a better job keeping things civil and sharing the spotlight.  At the time, playing up the drama and investment in <i>my</i> plot were what I was focusing on, and I didn't realize my mistakes until feelings were too hurt to save the game.<br/><br/>The difference between the games that worked and the one that didn't IMO, was that the games that worked had good OOC communication going on, at least between the romantic parties.  There was actually a lot of overlap between the one I was running that fell apart and the one that lasted a whole year, and, while the players that did not overlap had a large impact as well, there was just a different culture of communication between the games.  You simply have to keep that open, and try to deal with it before in game jealousy (which is delicious) becomes irl jealousy (which is awful).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463204">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463204/#Comment_463204" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-09T20:42:47+00:00" title="May  9, 2017  8:42PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 9, 2017 8:43PM by BeePeeGee.">edited May 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Take  look at the <i>Romance Trilogy</i> by <i>Emily Care Boss</i>.

Monsterhearts lends itself to that very easily and in a very in-your-face, intense way. There, interpersonal drama and messy sexuality are almost constantly present.

That's absolutely key; open discussion of what's going on - just like in actual, real-life romantic relationships - allows everyone to be "on the same team" and play with the romantic entanglements just as we do with combat positioning, character builds, or intrigue: we can chat about it together, talk about our goals and our desires, how we plan to achieve them, and then all contribute to making that work for each other.<br/><br/>Giving an occasionally mini-monologue or commenting on your character's desires and feelings can be enough to make this work. Take a cue from Shakespeare!<br/><br/>I've been lucky enough to never see any kind of negative romantic or sexual drama in a game, so my associations with it are purely positive (and I think it's really fun to explore!). The open communication is certainly a major part of why that's the case.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463282">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463282/#Comment_463282" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-12T04:15:24+00:00" title="May 12, 2017  4:15AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 12, 2017 4:16AM by BeePeeGee.">edited May 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Jeepform game <b>Doubt</b> is one of the most intriguing relationship games that I know:<br/><a href="http://jeepen.org/games/doubt/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://jeepen.org/games/doubt/</a><br/><br/>Basically, any RPGs that strongly invests in relationships like a lot of PbtA games, Hillfolk, Cortex Plus Dramatic etc can have a romantic focus.<br/><br/>What I personally find important when playing romantically oriented sessions is having clear <i>boundaries</i> in-character as well as among players.
