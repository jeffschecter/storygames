We go a bit deeper than the descriptions on the Kickstarter page to talk about how wide open the game is for any genre or tone, and how the different player roles in the game interact to create all kinds of drama.<br/><br/>There's still time to <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lamemage/kingdom" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">get in on the Kickstarter campaign for Kingdom</a>, which you're certainly going to want to do. Also mentioned: Go Play NW, Seattle's most brilliant story game con - tickets are still available!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
