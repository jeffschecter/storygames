I've spent a fair amount of time in those and seen how they can help and how they can be a catty little shitpile, and I think I've selected the rules that make for the best next steps in the process.</p>\n<p>The standards are based around the premise of bringing your game just as far as you can before you can go no further. Anything will be considered unfinished if it's up for critique, but I'm also assuming that you won't be making excuses for the decisions you've made.</p>\n<p>There will be a lot of questions asked. Be prepared to answer them. Be prepared also to think about what's being said before you respond. I'm less interested in this becoming a self-sustaining community than I am concerned that it act as a model for critique of games as products for publication as fits the publication objectives of the creator.</p>\n<p>I'd like to see drafts of game texts, layout designs, cover designs. I don't want to see ideas about a game. If you have an idea about a game, play it with friends a couple of times, write out a preliminary text that meets or exceeds the submission guidelines, and submit it then.</p>\n<p>I'm going to look at people who aren't submitting games but want to critique the work of others as probationary members. I'll expect them to be particularly careful that their comments are helpful or reconsider and just listen.</p>\n<p>Any more quesitons?</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
