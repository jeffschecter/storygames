The cheapest method would be a webcam, and some kind of basic Windowsy crap to grab that.<br><br>My suggestion in regards to microphones is to find a store that rents high-quality mics, tell them you need something you can put on a table that records in all directions, and then rent a couple and try them until you find one that works -- then buy that. We got one for work recently but I don't remember how much it cost -- pretty sure it was under $100 and it'd be perfect for recording tabletop roleplay. If I was at work I suppose I could give you a brand, but we basically found it by following the instructions above.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_73055">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73055/#Comment_73055" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-01T06:38:06+00:00" title="June  1, 2007  6:38AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Daniel.

A laptop's harddrive is normally 5400 rpm's, you may get stuttering audio. From what I have read many audiophiles recommend at least a 7200 rpm drive, and swear by 10000 rpm's (Raptors). A friend of mine who is a computer genius did a bunch of math to show why that is wrong and 5400 rpm's should be fine with the data rate. *shrugs* So your experience may vary. I was having problems with a 7200 rpm hard drive, but I may have had an irq conflict I couldn't sort out. If you have a laptop with firewire you could get an external harddrive. I would of course test record before buying something expensive.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are going cheap and don't get preprocessing equipment and are just plugging a microphone into your computer you want a microphone that is usb2 or firewire. Microphones with the 1/8" plugs are going to require your soundcard to do the conversion from analog to digital, typically this doesn't work well. A Microphone that ends in USB2, or Firewire is going to convert the analog signal to digital before it hits your computer. This works better.<br/>\n<br/>\nRecording Audio and video on the same computer is likely to go bad for you unless you have a fairly modern laptop. I'm thinking like Core 2 Duo modern. I could be totally wrong here as I've never tried it myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther options, if you have a non-nano ipod you could buy a microphone for the top. I know the Sons of Kryos use this method for recording on the road, and it makes a listen-able recording. I imagine it doesn't record in a raw, or wav format, but mp3, as I think those mini-drives are below 5400 rpm.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are planning to do post processing to try to make a better sound you want to record in wav or mp2. Note I said mp2 not mp3. Wav is uncompressed audio so this is your best option, but it requires more processing power, and hard drive speed. A Mp2 is compressed audio so it loses some of the recording. The reason you want mp2 is because it sounds better if you edit it after you record than an mp3 does. So you would record to mp2, do your editing, and save as an mp3. This is how ITConversations does their recording.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you use Audacity do any removal of audio you want to remove. I remove about half my "so", and "ums." You then want to do things in this order. Chose the edit tab then select from the menu, then all from the sub menu (edit-&gt;select-&gt;all). Then chose the effect menu and then each one of these options in order, Equalization, Compressor, Amplify (if the audio is too quite), and then Normalize. You want to listen before and after with Normalizing as if you have a lot of background noise, or line noise this is going to increase that volume. If you find that the volume of your voices are too different you may want to drop your file into <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.gigavox.com/levelator" rel="nofollow">the Levelator</a>. I haven't tried this program myself as I have separate microphones for each person, so I can independently adjust their volume, but I've heard good things.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me know if I'm not making sense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_75745">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75745/#Comment_75745" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-14T15:02:10+00:00" title="June 14, 2007  3:02PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Clyde... that was perfect!

Recording was almost no effort - we just stuffed the player into a dice cup and almost forgot about it. I'm not sure what model mp3 player it was, but the brand was Creative. I've also heard that iRivers are good.<br><br>The table we use isn't all that big, so maybe if you play at a big table or something you might need a better mic.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
