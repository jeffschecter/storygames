Hal and Lindsay who run the site have decided that they're not nearly busy enough and so are now cramming a fortnightly podcast into their schedule, ready and waiting for your listening pleasure at www.geek-a-saurus.com with a forum on the regular RPGMP3.com boards.<br/><br/>Matthew Sprange of Mongoose Publishing is the first interviewee, while Gregor Hutton provides a slickly professional bumper to lead into the show. Hal and Lindsay will be covering games and geek news (and upcoming episodes will feature interviews with several familiar names from Story Games) so it could be a good place if you have any product announcements or other titbits to send in. Contact details on the site, of course. I'm involved as an occasional contributor, but don't let that put you off.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
