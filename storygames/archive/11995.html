The only guy who has a significant experience as a master (apart from me, but my experience as a masster is both significant and negative <img alt=":/" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/confused.png" title=":/"/> ) is the one with the tightest schedule, so he cannot really put time in prep. i proposed to try some indie games, and they agreed. The most important thing, we need some game with  very light or no prep at all, and it also looks like  they're fascinated by masterless play. i have already played psi-run, and probably our first session will bne a one-shot of it, then i think we would all like to start an ongoing (albeit short, a couple of months) campaign. I also own Polaris, and would really like to try it. <br/><br/>Apart from the typical (and usually sensible) "play what you're more comfortable with" advice, which does not apply because it's quite a jump for everybody... what would you recommend or propose?<br/><br/>"help me, indie gaming scene, you're my last hope!!!"                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268256">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268256/#Comment_268256" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-22T04:41:48+00:00" title="April 22, 2010  4:41AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Games that I love that require little or no preparation and reward 5-6 solid sessions of play:<br/><br/>Primetime Adventures (Five sessions plus a pitch session/pilot is perfect)<br/>Archipelago II (Also GMless)<br/>Solar System (Can be used in full-bore campaign mode as well)<br/><br/>Contenders is GMless fun but probably won't last more than three sessions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_268257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian" title="Sebastian"><img alt="Sebastian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/838/nVUKKCMFWPRML.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian">Sebastian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268257/#Comment_268257" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-22T04:41:48+00:00" title="April 22, 2010  4:41AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I recommend Contenders. You can read it in an hour, it drives great stories, there's no GM and you can play it as a campaign or a one-shot. It delivers interesting, dramatic story lines. Plus, the rules are very digestible.<br/><br/>There's a scene choosing mechanic, which works well (especially for cross-over gamers). On your turn, you get to choose which type of scene you are setting, like a "connection scene" which builds up relationships for your character, or a "work scene" which has your character involved in nefarious shenanigans. Each turn you try to build up resources (like Hope and Pain), in order to bring your character closer to his goal. So, essentially, you are trying to get points for your character and this is done by framing particular kinds of scenes.<br/><br/>The big boon for this mechanic is that anyone can do well with it. A lot of pressure is removed from scene framing just because there are a limited number of mechanical choices. E.g., My character's girlfriend is getting beaten up by the mob for her gambling debt. I need to get her some cash. I can either a) use a Connection scene to give her the cash I have, or b) use a work scene to build up more cash for her. Etc. The mechanical decision drives the scene framing. After that, the results become organic and tense\u2014loaded with consequence.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.princeofdarknessgames.com/contenders/index.htm" rel="nofollow">Give it a look.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268267">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Queex" title="Queex"><img alt="Queex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Queex">Queex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268267/#Comment_268267" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-22T05:40:15+00:00" title="April 22, 2010  5:40AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It may be worthwhile to try to refine what you're after; do you want something prep-less by design or something that can be run prep-less if you want? I would guess the former, as I find the latter is something that happens when you become supremely comfortable with a system that usually requires prep. Do you want a game where chargen happens ahead of play, or one with little or no chargen required before you start? How Indie do you want to go? Do you want Indie stylings and rules wrapped around a more familiar, objective-based story or something Indie to the core? <br/><br/><i>Produces own trumpet</i><br/>I have written a GM-less, zero-prep

you know of?<br/><br/>Queex: <br/>No need for shame,every suggestion is more than gladly accepted... and your game seems interesting, even though i don't know if it's suitable, because most of us are not confident  with such a degree of improvisation in rpg, i fear...<br/><br/>i agree on the comment you did on systems that can be run prep-less if you want (the fact that you need to know them really well), so i think that  a prep-less born game would be the best choice... i'm quite cool with "traditional" (ahead of play) chargen, but other options can also be interesting, as long as they are not to complex and/or aloof, from the point of view of mostly trad players... the last question is the most ifficult: i think that the idea of "Indie stylings and rules wrapped around a more familiar, objective-based story" might be better, even though i would not  totally  exclude other options...<br/><br/>and by the way, i stopped mid-post to take a look at your game, and i'm kind of

href="http://memento-mori.com/online-store/octane-premium-unleaded/" rel="nofollow">octaNe</a>, Really good fun, really easy to play.<br/><br/>Also really good would be either Lady Blackbird or Danger Patrol from <a href="http://www.onesevendesign.com" rel="nofollow">John Harper</a>. Both take a little bit of time for dyed-in-the-wool old-school gamers (from my experience), but once everyone has the hang of it, they are EXCEPTIONAL. And FREE. Both are easily adaptable to a variety of different settings, and there's plenty of AP reports floating around on this forum that you can steal ideas from.<br/>Lady Blackbird, overall though, would be the easiest, since all you really need to do is print out the rules, and some extra copies of the characters for the players. Everything is self-contained. With Danger Patrol, there's a lot of extra bits you need to print and cut-out, and you have to get a few extra pieces ready (various dice, counters, markers, etc.) But when it comes to getting down and playing, Danger Patrol meshes better I think with some of the old-school mentality.

Excellent game, and really low prep.  The GM needs 5-10 minutes head start to look through the papers before you start playing.  I wrote some GM:ing advice for the game on my blog: <a href="http://wilper.wordpress.com/2010/04/21/playing-lady-blackbird-by-john-harper/" rel="nofollow">http://wilper.wordpress.com/2010/04/21/playing-lady-blackbird-by-john-harper/</a>.  Nothing there that is not already in Johns game, just other words.  Maybe you will feel safer diving into the game after reading them.  Good choice for first indie-game anyway.  <br/><br/>* Universalis. <a href="http://ramshead.indie-rpgs.com/" rel="nofollow">http://ramshead.indie-rpgs.com/</a> Neat game that can emulate any genre and uses a bidding mechanism to determine who has narrative privileges. An old indie game, if there is any such thing. Great game but in my experience the first game you play always crashes and burns, since all the players will be testing the boundaries.  Subsequent games will be much better. Perhaps something for when you have played a few sessions of other games.<br/><br/>* While the World Ends. <a href="http://www.lulu.com/product/file-download/while-the-world-ends/6008357" rel="nofollow">http://www.lulu.com/product/file-download/while-the-world-ends/6008357</a> It really isn't prep free, but the prep is part of the game and you do it together before your story starts.

But as for Lady Blackbird, the less you as GM prepares the better.  The game thrives on the improvisation of all the participants, not just the GM's.  I have already pointed towards my <a href="http://wilper.wordpress.com/2010/04/21/playing-lady-blackbird-by-john-harper/" rel="nofollow">blog</a>, in regard to the no-prep aspect of LB, but I will stress it harder: IMO Lady Blackbird only becomes less good if you prepare yourself before you run it, as you will no doubt start planning cool stuff.<br/><br/>Prep in the way of gathering pens, dice and poker chips for the pools is quite necessary though. :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_268842">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268842/#Comment_268842" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-25T07:05:46+00:00" title="April 25, 2010  7:05AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For no-prep fun, I totally second In A Wicked Age.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268901">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268901/#Comment_268901" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-25T21:35:57+00:00" title="April 25, 2010  9:35PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 25, 2010 9:36PM by Ben_Robbins.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In A Wicked Age, thirded.
