Over the last couple of months the tone on this board has changed substantially. I'm about as upbeat and happy-go-lucky as it comes but guys, the barriers to entry into 'successful' indie games publishing that are being thrown up by respected already-published games designers are staggering. STAGGERING. For me Chad's 'Heresy...' thread was the last straw.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat happened to the ideals of mutualism? What happened to the idea that you could publish without the huge buy-ins that the established games industry requires? What happened to nuturing new designers and new ideas? All I can see is a bunch of people saying 'We want to have indie games but produced to the standards, procedures and quality of 'non-indie' games'.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd thats a laudible goal but in the end thats just recreating the barriers to entry into publishing that the entire thing tore down in the first place.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe I'm being a little unfair. This is help. But it isn't help like mentoring - its a dose of TOUGH LOVE. When I wrote my reply to a previous thread where I was 'Mr Glass Half Full vs Mr Glass Half Empty' it was tinged with more than a dash of truth from my perception. These barriers are becoming almost insurmountable for someone who doesn't have balls of steel.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night I had a long, hard think about everything. Why am I taking this so personally? Why am I getting angry about it? I realised that a lot of it was because a lot of people who post on here and their games, have inspired me to do what I am doing and this attitude of 'not good enough, not good enough, not good enough!' just isn't inspiring. I thought that I was a little angry because I have my own support network both with an extended family of gaming friends and with Collective Endeavour - but what about a new designer stumbling across S-G for the first time? If I was them I would just walk away, aghast.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohnathan is absolutely right - if a new designer has the slightest crack of doubt reading through some of the stuff on here recently is going to shatter their dream into a million pieces. Only the most steel-balled egotist would be able to carry on regardless.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo rather than presenting barrier after barrier, how about helping some new designers with real world, practical advice or tips or workarounds? Advice on how to harness those doubts and focus them into making better games? How about remembering that everyone has to have a first game and everyone is allowed to make mistakes and learning from those mistakes is fine and healthy. How about lowering the bar a little - or at least helping people over the bar rather than standing on the other side saying 'not good enough!'?<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause if that doesn't happen all that the community will degenerate into is a group of published designers telling each other how terrible things are and a cadre of steel balled egotists screaming 'fuck that shit!' back at them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere. Finally. Its out. I feel better for that. I know this isn't going to sit well with some people but this is my honest considered opinion as an unpublished gamer with a game deep in its mid-playtest stages. I'm not some irrate emo-nutter kid. I'm a 37 year old father of two with an honours degree who works in marketing, design and print production. If I feel like this - and I have a number of the skills that are being called for - how must it feel to others?!<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
