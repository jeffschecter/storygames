It only just occurred to me (in the magic hours of an all-nighter) that I'm not sure if that is possible.<br/><br/>I suspect that one of the cores of "game qua game" is an exploration of the existent, a simulation, "corner case" experimentation, a case study, and the like. We (well, y'all) make "story games" which seems to imply an adherence to narrative (NO! NO GNS!!! The original meaning!), building towards theme, cooperating on a final product (be that as it may)--something with a product that could parallel the products of every other art.<br/><br/>I'd like to invite some brainstorming on what a game without emulation of other media would "look like". Is there a space outside of the Venn diagram of movie, novel, parable, fable (painting, music, sculpture, economics, logic, math) that gaming could populate? I've seen games described as "jam sessions" and "cooperative writing"; I've seen games that seem to value the artifact more than the engagement (think minis); I've seen games built around resource management challenges. What's outside of these media? Can gaming find a place to stand that can not be described as "well, it's like ____, but you do ____"? Sculpture can not be so-described; it has what one might call a "non-referential definition".<br/><br/>If it's any consolation... I got nothin' either. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I suspect that gaming (in every sense of the term) is a second-order (derivative, reactionary, combinatory, analytic) activity. I do not say that to be pejorative, but merely because I've been a game theorist (by avocation) most of my life, and I can't even come up with one example to start the ball rolling.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338692">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338692/#Comment_338692" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-14T05:42:31+00:00" title="August 14, 2011  5:42AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't see this overwhelming tendency towards emulation, myself - sure, there are many games that essentially draw their structural inspiration from prior models, but then there is also a strong tradition of games starting with <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i> that have nothing whatsoever to do with other narrative forms.<br/><br/>This isn't even anything correlating with "story games", as it is quite possible to make dramatic and plot-driven games that do not conform to other storytelling modes. Practically any story game predicated on adventure gaming models of play remains fundamentally unable to map itself onto movies or novels, simply because the formats are not the same. <i>Sorcerer</i> is a simple example, or take <i>Shadow of Yesterday</i> for even a more striking one: one just might mention movie logic in a TSoY rules-text when justifying dramatic coordination or other features that this style of game shares with other forms of drama, but the dramatic structure itself is something that only coincidentally resembles pre-existing forms. Sure, one can postulate a literary form that produces structurally similar stories (some kind of ensemble cast slice of life periodical from the 18th century, maybe?), but the truth is that such resemblance is incidental, not derivative: the dramatic model of adventure roleplaying originates in the social and practical necessities of traditional roleplaying with its adventurer parties, weekly sessions, player-character correspondence and other such unique features, and not in simply copying other arts as you claim. Whatever commonalities there might be are no more than the commonalities between literature and cinema.<br/><br/>To emphasize, I do think that there are many games that get their essential inspiration, dramatic forms and even procedural frameworks from other arts. These range from the obvious (like <i>Primetime Adventures</i>) to ones that have organically embedded these assumptions into their structures (<i>Spirit of the Century</i>, say). But games built like this are by no means everything out there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_338693">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bad_Santa" title="Bad_Santa"><img alt="Bad_Santa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://anvalisok.com/cthulhu.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bad_Santa">Bad_Santa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338693/#Comment_338693" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-14T06:08:47+00:00" title="August 14, 2011  6:08AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like this topic.<br/>\n<br/>\nArt already encompasses the width and breadth of humanity.  The human story has already been told so many times and so many ways that there really isn't anything new to tell.  That isn't to say we shouldn't try, or that telling these stories again is bad in any way.  All art is derivative of reality (and how we view reality can be derivative of art).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf instead you look at the mode and method used to tell these stories or the experience of participating in these stories gaming is already it's own unique story form.  Unlike TV, novels, music or theater, the only audience is the actors, the only actors the audience.  It's a performance that isn't intended to be viewed by others.  Though it certainly be.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe use language to describe things and the power of language is the ability to construct and deconstruct symbols.  We describe gaming experiences like other things because we know they are a shared experience, so we use them as a symbol to convey our meaning.  That doesn't necessarily make gaming derivative from other forms (any more than all art is derivative of what came before), it's just us using language to convey our experiences to other people.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaming is still relatively young, I very much believe that someone will come along at some point and show us a completely revolutionary way to think about the experience or apply it to something no one even knew existed.  Until then, I think it's more than okay to borrow from various art forms to find new ways to tell stories.  Borrowing and telling stories are two central themes to the human experience after all.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, I think a potentially interesting concept would be to borrow from <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_theater" rel="nofollow">Epic Theater</a>.  The idea is to create a process that distances the audience from the action to allow for greater objectivity and contemplation.  Purposely inserting elements that break the illusion.  It might be too delicate a balance to try to maintain, encouraging roleplaying while also drawing the player away from it.  Some of these concepts are already present in games, or used by groups, but a game designed to call them out and why could be interesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338700/#Comment_338700" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-14T07:44:49+00:00" title="August 14, 2011  7:44AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting!<br><br>My initial reaction is the same as Eero's:<br><br>D&amp;D, the very beginning of the hobby, seems to emulate nothing but itself.

I think games are their own thing as a type of medium whereas, games can also be translated and expressed by borrowing metaphors from other media. Moreover, I would say that this is true of all media. Particular media (books, video games, movies, photography, &amp;c) all have particular untranslatable, non-adequate and singular qualities, yet we can only talk about this qualities using metaphors from other media. That is to say, when I talk about photography, picture and film don't come out of my mouth. So, to me, emulation in games (trying to be like a TV serial is a common one) is the same as dancing about architecture or writing about music. Often a fun, productive and creative project but ultimately when you dancing or write you're translating buildings and sounds from one media to another. <br><br>So, in this sense, it's impossible for RPGs to be like other media but also impossible for RPGs to be expressed in terms that aren't always already metaphors from other media. No matter how hard you try, your Buffy RPG is never going to capture the feeling, tone and style of a Buffy episode. But also, when you're designing or playing a game, the way you interpret the narrative, characters and so on, is always going be with a conscious or unconscious reference to all those Buffy episodes you watched.<br/><br/>In a more practical sense, this came up in a design thread over on Barf Forth Apocalyptica. I was musing about XP mechanics and I was asked what genre my hack was trying to emulate, as there are a number (almost all of them) AW hacks that are geared towards other media, genre or other RPG titles. There's two hacks about just supernatural TV serial dramas (Monster of the Week and Monsterhearts). I didn't have any answer. None? I mean, it's influenced by the all the stuff I like: Aeon Flux, Crystal Castles, William Gibson, Jean Baudrillard, Liquid Sky, Fashion and War photography, &amp;c. So, it's less a project of emulation than bricolage. <br/><br/>Which is just what I mean: RPGs exist with reference to other genres, media, &amp;c as the basis of the their intelligibility but even RPGs that are deisgned to 'emulate' are not reducible to those genres.<br/><br/>Moreover, I feel like RPGs already are their own genre. MMORPGs borrow so, so, so heavily from D&amp;D et al throughout their history. MMORPGs are translations of TTRPGs and it shows. None the less, MMORPGs are their own animal, species even. <br/><br/>Can we design towards what is unique about RPGs? Yes. And I agree that it's a conceptual space little explored. Should be explored.<br/><br/>I don't by the sculpture non-referential definition even a little: it's like painting but in three dimensions.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338756/#Comment_338756" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-14T16:42:10+00:00" title="August 14, 2011  4:42PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 14, 2011 4:43PM by Nathan_H.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uno_%28card_game%29" rel="nofollow">Uno</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_338757">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338757/#Comment_338757" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-14T17:02:00+00:00" title="August 14, 2011  5:02PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>make games that don't emulate or attempt to engender the effects of other media</blockquote>\nWhere would <a href="http://www.lamemage.com/" rel="nofollow">Microscope</a> fall in your criteria?

A likely span of time is chosen (the text can't cover everything, of course). Periods are drawn as time is chopped up along themes which could be chapters or sections of history. Events occur and some events require further in depth analysis and explanation, so they are given in great detail (differently colored sidebars in history texts; scenes in Microscope,). Although content can be generated without regard to chronology, a organizing system is used to add meaning (Scrivener and dates in the text book; the order and placement of note cards on a table in Microscope). Other than the fact that Microscope asks the player to create content instead of checking reality for it, how is Microscope different than a text book writing emulation? <br/><br/>(And just saying that it is way more fun, although true, is not sufficient!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338775">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338775/#Comment_338775" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-14T19:30:59+00:00" title="August 14, 2011  7:30PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Since I suggested this topic...<br/><br/>Fantasy roleplaying (including "rpg fiction" like Dragonlance etc.) is already a genre by this point, so making another fantasy RPG is -- really by definition -- emulative of an existing genre.  And even D&amp;D comes from a number of fictional precedents, including the massive Tolkien fad of the 1970s.<br/><br/>Things like Microscope / Universalis / etc. are interesting because they provide a structure but not really content and even the structure isn't particularly evocative of another medium.<br/><br/>Really, though, what I was suggesting was more like... uh... the original Super Mario Bros. or many other old school video games, where the content of play was derived from things that were fun to do in a game, rather than things that really made much logical sense, or was something relatively abstract (as in Tetris or Bubble Bobble or Pac-Man).

Non-participation is an equally effective way to say "your question doesn't make sense".--<br/><br/>(I'll back away from the "sculpture is 3D painting" counter, as I merely wanted an illuminating metaphor for what I meant by "referential", and I think folks know what I am asking, here, anyway, in spite of its poor parallel.)<br/><br/>Microscope and Uni seem to fit my sense of emulation: emulation of narrative, in particular. I've never played "WAY out of the box" with Uni--making some non-linear, non-conflict-driven, non-character-development pastiche--so that might be one of the "next things" about which I'm curious. And the second that I read "create fiction in a non-linear, non-chronological fashion. I can't think of a media that matches" I thought, "Pulp Fiction, a movie." Maybe that's a poo-poo, but I could see PF as an ensemble-cast PTA game quite easily, borrowing some of Uni's non-chronological tricks (and, lo! finding emergent theme from the cross-pollination of otherwise "separate" plot lines).<br/><br/>Lastly, it seems half of my question is lost in the attack on "emulation"--I also said, "engender the effects of other media," and, "something with a product that could parallel the products of every other art." Yes, gaming as an activity is somewhat unique, in practice: it's a bit of art, a bit of improv acting, a bit of creative writing, a bit of gambling, a bit of social maneuvering. But its end result--its product, the artifacts and narratives and themes--always seem, to me, to harken back to fiction, traditional arts, and technological media.<br/><br/>Least I be accused of cursing the darkness without bringing any light: I might HAVE an example, thanks to the madness of drunkards at GenCon: SageFight. If it emulates anything, it's martial arts: hardly a "media," though, YES, it has in turn inspired other media, especially movies and anime. But the GAME creates a DANCE, but is never done to "look like we're dancing" (I don't think)--it's done to win and have fun (not necessarily in that order). Contrast that with "our epic D&amp;D campaign of thirty years was SO like something Tolkien would have written!"<br/><br/>Hmmm... SF might not be role playing, though. *whimpers*<br/><br/>Levi might be on track with his point about "a game with no emulation would, I'd think, be <i>neither</i> based on [diagetic] realism <i>nor</i> attached to genre [and genre themes], in the minds of those playing it."

I use the history book analogy myself in the Microscope text, to get people in the right state of mind. I think in play it breaks pretty quickly (which is good). If it was a book, it would be a pretty chaotic book that left a lot out. It would talk about a revolutionary leader getting betrayed and executed, switch to talking about hundreds of years later when someone has a picnic by a statue of him, and then jump back to a scene when his Dad got drafted to fight for the army.

I've only been describing in short-hand, so if you're just going by my description I could see where the confusion would creep in.<br/><br/>I don't think Microscope emulates narrative in anything like the normal sense of the word. In fact that's one of the complaints I hear ("where's the story?" which really means "where's the one story?"). By comparison, Pulp Fiction is a linear narrative, a very tight story, told out of sequence. All the part fit together perfectly.

What does it mean to emulate narrative? To include cause and effect? To have characters?<br/><br/>The idea that simply including conflict in the content of a game automatically makes it emulation... that's a pretty radical definition. Is that actually the goal, to carve down to the bone? Is this some sort of Clement Greenberg deal, where you want roleplaying to focus on the unique qualities of its own medium -- to make those qualities into the content of the game? And if so what would this look like, and how would it avoid emulating narrative?<br/><br/>I mean, I think you also need to be clearer about where you are drawing the line on emulation as a verb -- is that about the game and the players taking specific actions towards producing this sort of content, or does it include when that sort of content is accidentally created, because it is what the players just happened to decide to do? And if the latter, consider that most players will always happen to decide to emulate stuff they're already familiar with. So does a game have to actually be rigorously anti-emulation in order to produce play you will consider not-emulation?<br/><br/>If not, I think people have already mentioned games that qualify, even if people typically use those games to emulate genres or narrative or all those other things that people think about when they think about stories and characters and situations and their own life. If "characters and situations and my own life" are not emulation-free content then I think you're going to have a lot of trouble producing emulation-free play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_338946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338946/#Comment_338946" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-15T15:48:24+00:00" title="August 15, 2011  3:48PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, what Daniel said.

Genre and medium are extremely distinct concepts.<br/><br/>Genre is a set of shared tropes. Those tropes can be repeated across multiple media. Sharing those tropes does not make the media the same thing.<br/><br/>The Lord of the Rings books are not the same thing and the Lord of the Rings movies, even though they were trying to tell essentially the same story (Tolkein hyper-enthusiasts please humor me for a moment here). Likewise, paintings, board games, TTRPGs, LARPs, and many other media have been used to create artifacts using the same tropes and "creating the same stories" to some extent or other.<br/><br/>But each of those artifacts created in a different media is a different thing.<br/><br/>Are movies just derivatives of novels, because they use similar narrative structures? Far from it.<br/><br/>That being said, I do agree that design could focus on emphasizing the differences. Emphasizing the things that the medium does better than others.<br/><br/>With larp, I already know what that is. Larp does simultaneous action better than any other media does.

I picked that language to intentionally distance it from the improvisational theatre, because the participants in improv aren't the intended audience. One can identify with Harry's sense of bewilderment at discovering the world plays by different rules than he thought, but when reading or watching "The Sorcerer's Stone" you don't assume his identity. <br/>So, for me, that becomes the starting point. What is uniquely powerful about assuming a different identity for a time?<br/>That question keeps taking me back to a game of DiTV where I played a woman filled with the spirit of the she bear. Attempting to respond to a situation involving an out of wedlock pregnancy in the way such a woman would dramatically clarified/altered my real world beliefs about sexuality and relationships. I don't think that would have happened had I watched a movie or read the novelization about that encounter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_339172">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339172/#Comment_339172" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-17T01:51:28+00:00" title="August 17, 2011  1:51AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 17, 2011 1:52AM by Ben_Robbins.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite><cite>Posted By: Ben Robbins</cite>I don't think Microscope emulates narrative in anything like the normal sense of the word.</blockquote>Not having read it... does it emulate a history text, as suggested above? Within a given "Scene" (IIRC), does it have any resemblance to a news article? If not... yep, that's one. If "gaming" eventually happens.<br/>As I replied to Morgan earlier, no, Microscope is not like a history text. The action jumps all over the place, following the interests of the players instead of methodically mapping the history. Each player can jump backwards or forwards in time, zooming out to paint broad strokes or zooming way in to add minute details, as they wish. You're filling in holes as you go, but there are always more holes. The details that emerge are usually surprising, since you're only allowed to build on each other, not collaborate.<br/><br/>Microscope scenes are created a little different than normal, but they are role-played in a fairly ordinary fashion. You create a Scene to answer some Question, which might be something important in the grand scheme of history ("does the Imperial Senate care about the people?", "can East Ostria power its mills without imported coal?") or might be something that's only important to these characters ("is the soldier proud or ashamed of his military decorations?"). You role-play the Scene to find out the answer.

They facilitate the shared creation of new narratives better than any other medium.</blockquote>I think you stray a bit back into the shallow waters, here, though. RPGs add a system layer to what is an ancient artform: the story circle. Hell, two guys telling a fish story by the fire do essentially the same thing, just without dice (no one would believe they lost a 2d6 pound bass!).</blockquote>Multiple people telling a story together about something that actually happened is ancient practice, yes. It's a fish story.<br/><br/>Multiple people telling a story together about something that DIDN'T happen is something else. It's something that uses structures to facilitate it, because you don't have the structure of WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED to facilitate the process.<br/><br/>When you do it for an audience, it's improv theatre. Which has structures to do it well. Like "yes, and" practices. An improv group also uses things like stock characters, lines, and situations that take advantage of the fact that their audience generally changes often - allowing to fake some of the actual improvisation and, essentially, cheat a bit.<br/><br/>When you do it for a small group sitting around the table where each person is both creator and audience, it's tabletop roleplaying. Unsurprisingly, some of the improv techniques work well, like "yes, and" rules. However, the reusing of characters, lines, and situations works less well, because it's an internal performance with the same audience.<br/><br/>When you do it for a group that's standing up and moving around and embodying their characters more, it's larp. When you larp with a small group, some of the techniques that work well in tabletop still work well. But as the group size increases, the experience splinters more and more and the differences in the medium are accentuated.<br/><br/>All three of those media are different from the ancient practice of group storytelling, because they are structured by systems/practices other than the telling of something that actually happened (which is the thing that makes otherwise unstructured storytelling work).<br/><br/>And I would argue that the ancient art of fictional storytelling involves author-driven media: <br/> - Single voice storytelling, which is functionally nearly identical to modern story authoring, with just a few changes based on the needs of performance and memorization.<br/> - Drama (plays), which is driven by the authoring of a text beforehand, which is then interpreted during performance.<br/><br/>All of these are different media. But all of them are related in a lot of ways, and can benefit a lot by borrowing from each other.<br/><br/>So what's different about RPGs? What are the most hugely important elements of that medium?<br/><br/>The different ways you can structure interactions between the participants at the table during the event. Because it's that structured interaction that's the most indicitave thing about the medium.<br/><br/>I think recognizing that is the reason behind the indie game movement/revolution thingy. I think that is the primary thing that developers have been focusing on more and more for the past decade or so.<br/><br/>So I would argue that, even when a game is heavily borrowing in regards to genre, if it's plowing new ground when it comes to structuring the interaction between participants, then it isn't mired in the limitations of emulation.<br/><br/>Apocalypse World is an excellent example. It draws heavily on the post apoc genre. But it structures player interactions in new and exciting ways, which is why folks are so excited about it.<br/><br/>Smallville did similar good work. It draws heavily on the superhero genre. It also is informed heavily by the style of TV show that Smallville is - super heavy on relationships and secrets and such. But the game didn't just say "here's some generic task resolution mechanics and some stats for Clark, now go." Instead, they created a massively fascinating system that used relationships as stats, which hugely changes the way the players think about the interactions between characters. Suddenly you have superhero characters who are strengthened and weakened by drama and feelings rather than by physical prowess and kryptonite. Being able to create a storytelling game where that sort of thing makes sense was a mindblowing challenge that the creators tackled exceptionally well by focusing, not on how to model physics in an accurate but abstracted way, but on how to drive player interactions in a way that would end up with a result that would emphasize the soap opera elements over the super powers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_339288">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339288/#Comment_339288" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-17T15:09:44+00:00" title="August 17, 2011  3:09PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To return to the original question - is it possible to create an RPG that creates an output that doesn't resemble other media?<br/><br/>The answer depends entirely on what scope you are willing to look at.<br/><br/>If you look at too wide of a scope, I think it's totally impossible, because there are too many other media that are too much related.<br/><br/>Likewise, you can't create a film that doesn't resemble something that could be done with another media.<br/> - You could take photos of the same things that are in the film and put them next to each other in a book or a studio. If you then added text that related to what was in the movie, you would have something that resembled the movie.<br/> - You could have people on stage acting out the same things that happened in the movie. You would have something that resembled the movie.<br/> - You could write a book about the movie. It would resemble the movie.<br/><br/>Would there be differences? Sure. But you would be able to draw strong parallels between the two.<br/><br/>So looking at it from that perspective - no, you can't create an RPG that doesn't in any way resemble what you could (or what others already have) created with other media.<br/><br/>But that doesn't mean you can't emphasize and highlight the differences.<br/><br/>Thing is, as I said, I think this is being done.

Like almost every single oral/mythological tradition ever? I have no doubt whatsoever that bards/mystics/learned dudes used to sit around exchanging stories about, say, Coyote, or Odysseus, or any other comparable figure or cast of figures that were popular in that particular culture at that particular time.<br/><br/>Did they collaborate directly on the stories with each other, I don't know, but they certainly would have exchanged their versions of the stories, incorporated each other's best bits, retold them elsewhere, etc. That's pretty much the baseline.<br/><br/>And what made these things work was not a reference to actual events but a reference to previous stories, to the tropes of the genre, to the established 'facts' of the larger fictional world of the stories, etc. Exactly the sort of things that you suggest were not present, or are only present in modern incarnations. I'm not an expert here but I would bet a lot of money that the actual practice of many 'professional bards' involved a great deal of audience suggestion, audience participation, and improvisation around a theme.<br/><br/>-<br/><br/>So yeah, I appreciate what you are trying to get at, but you don't need to deny these elements to historical cultures in order to justify their contemporary re-positioning. Everything you say works just as well without trying to exclude something which almost certainly was far more common than most of us would assume -- because after all we are so, so used to the complete separateness of the author from the audience, etc. that we have trouble imagining that it is merely an incidental fact of our culture, rather than some historically-longstanding trend.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_339406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339406/#Comment_339406" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-18T07:31:48+00:00" title="August 18, 2011  7:31AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, can we stop talking about this in the abstract?

I totally get that. But that's different. That's one primary creator at work at a time, though that one primary creator may be taking influences either from their current audience or from the time they've spent as audience for other creators.<br/><br/>But based on what I know of historical story creation practices, there were not situations where you had 5 people gathered around with only themselves as an audience creating a story from scratch with different people in charge of different characters in that story. That sort of structure is extremely new, historically speaking. I haven't come across references to anything similar that's more than 100 years old.<br/><br/>Author-driven storytelling for an audience is a different thing, even if the author is taking influences from past performances of others or from the current audience. <br/><br/>It is possible that professional bards would hang out an "story jam" together. But if they did, it wasn't recorded. And even if they did, that still marks a difference. Modern story games are designed to make such a process possible for those who are far from being professional storytellers. They do so by introducing structures, techniques, procedures that facilitate that process.<br/><br/>I don't think it's unfair to think of roleplaying games as a relatively new medium, even though it's one that has parallels to older media and certainly draws from them. <br/><br/>When photography was developed, it's use was certainly informed by painting, with which it shared many elements, such as framing and the use of light and shadow. But the forms diverged as people explored what the two could do (especially because painters mostly stopped trying to do photrealistic painting, because photography could do such things like portraiture much more effectively).<br/><br/>Likewise, roleplaying shares much in common with other storytelling forms. And I think some of those similarities are either inescapable or there's little to be gained in trying to escape them (like the way photography and painting both nearly always make use of framing).<br/><br/>But there's potentially some room for exploring things that are, if perhaps not 100% unique, are at least done better by TTRPGs than other media.<br/><br/>So I'll frame this question:<br/><br/>What do TTRPGs do better than other media?<br/><br/>(And be warned, there's probably a few things that I'll argue that larp does better than tabletop. I consider them to be separate, though closely related, media. Like photography and film.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_339539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339539/#Comment_339539" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-18T15:25:48+00:00" title="August 18, 2011  3:25PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's something TTRPGs may possibly do better than any other media:<br/><br/>They expand to the scope of the participant's imagination better than any other media, because the only real limitation is the imagination of the other participants.<br/><br/>Sure, when you write a novel, you can decide what happens. You can go anywhere with it. But when a reader reads it, it always turns out essentially the same way (though it's perhaps a bit different if the reader is in a different mindset - and even more differences are possible if it's a choose-your-own-adventure story).<br/><br/>This is one of the things that, for example, TTRPGs are much better at than larp. Larp, depending on how you do it, has a lot more limitations about where you go with it (and the more it overcomes those limitations, the more it starts to resemble other media). Having your characters who are hanging out on a farm suddenly appear on the doorstep of the castle because that's where one of the characters wanted to go is much harder in larp than it is in TTRPGs, for example.<br/><br/>Sure, you can do that sort of quick jump in a movie, but again, when you do it in that media it is responding to the sole creator's imagination, rather than the participant's.<br/><br/>And you can do that in a video game. But only if the castle is part of the content in the game. If the creators haven't put it there, then you can't go.<br/><br/>One particular technique example of this is aggressive scene framing. Yes, even the name of that technique is drawn from other media. But I think the way it happens in TTRPGs is different than how it happens in a movie.<br/><br/>In a TTRPG, it's like you're combining the responsive, dynamic creativity of improv acting with powerful director-driven storytelling techniques of film, sprinkled with the immersiveness of larp characterization, and putting the three together in a way that none of the related media does as well.<br/><br/>Also, you can bash orcs and take their gold.
