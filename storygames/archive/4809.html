He says they have an opening in their writing staff and he's having a hard time filling it. Daniel wanted to know if he could put the word out here on Penny Arcade and [Gabe is] more than happy to help. So do you want to write for the new Bioware MMO?<br/><br/>----------------------------<br/><br/>Hey Guys,<br/><br/>So here's the situation we're in. BioWare games require a great deal of<br/>writing. Storylines, world building, characters, journals - and about a<br/>bazillion lines of dialogue. What makes my job harder is not only does<br/>all of this writing have to be high quality - something not always<br/>demanded in our industry - it can only be done by writers who understand<br/>the complexities of interactive fiction. Take the average screenwriter<br/>who doesn't play RPGs, place him in front of the writing tool from<br/>Neverwinter Nights and you'll get a linear story with a complete lack of<br/>Player agency and no interesting decisions. Just trying to explain the<br/>concept behind writing without a protagonist to someone who has never<br/>even been a dungeon master can be like showing card tricks to a dog.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the current problem. The BioWare MMO is the largest<br/>thing we've ever done by leaps and bounds. We're talking a double digit<br/>writing staff working for years (yes we've already been working for well<br/>over a year). Now I've realized I need even more writers and I've got no<br/>reliable way of predicting where they're going to come from. In the<br/>history of the company, we've had published fantasy authors,<br/>screenwriters and editors all wash out of BioWare's training program. On<br/>the flip side, we've had fantastic kids right of college, an ex CNN<br/>producer and a former gift wrapping clerk from Singapore all succeed in<br/>the BioWare writer family. Previous job of lead writer for Baldur's Gate<br/>2, the highest rated PC RPG in history? Travelodge manager.<br/><br/>So yes, we're shaking the usual trees and our HR folks are turning over<br/>all the rocks they can think of but I had to go through over three<br/>hundred qualified candidates to find the team I have now so a lot of<br/>those trees have done already been shook. With that level of challenge<br/>around finding writers, I want to throw out an open invitation for<br/>anyone out there that thinks might be the strange combination of RPG<br/>fiend and talented writer to grab a copy of Neverwinter Nights and start<br/>putting together a writing sample. I don't care if you can script, just<br/>put three guys in a field and attach conversations to them. Make the<br/>plot compelling, write the NPCs as real people who could exist in a<br/>believable world even if the PC wasn't there, give me an interesting<br/>choice or two and you're done -- easily something can be done over a<br/>weekend and there's a ton of great community support online if you're<br/>really tech deficient.<br/><br/>Anyone out there want to write for the game company with three of the<br/>top five rated RPGs of all time on their biggest project ever?<br/><br/>Head here: <a href="http://www.bioware.com/bioware_info/jobs/positions/austin_writer.html" rel="nofollow">BioWare Jobs</a><br/><br/><br/>Cheers,<br/><br/>Daniel Erickson<br/>Principal Lead Writer<br/>BioWare Austin<br/>------------------------------<br/>**** End Repost****<br/><br/>Anyhow - I think it would be neat if a story gamer could get a job there and bring some new thinking to the BioWare MMO.<br/><br/>--Brandon                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108003/#Comment_108003" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-12T17:06:07+00:00" title="November 12, 2007  5:06PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is there anyone out there who has a copy of Neverwinter Nights development tools and would be willing to put people's scripts on three guys in a field?<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_108005">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/T-Boy" title="T-Boy"><img alt="T-Boy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/T-Boy">T-Boy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108005/#Comment_108005" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-12T17:10:14+00:00" title="November 12, 2007  5:10PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 12, 2007 5:16PM by T-Boy.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Huh.

And I would say with a giant like Bioware, they are still very much their own beast.  That might change after a few years, but given the distance between Austin and Redwood Shores, it seems unlikely to happen as fast as it did for Maxis (which also still retains some separateness).<br/><br/>And thanks largely to that suit from EA Spouse's spouse, many video game studios, at least here in California, stopped counting non-management employees as exempt from overtime (which already had been a law on the books for about 20 years).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_108028">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson" title="Ben_Johnson"><img alt="Ben_Johnson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2283/2131054135_2403ed15ce_s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson">Ben_Johnson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108028/#Comment_108028" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-12T20:20:16+00:00" title="November 12, 2007  8:20PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As an employee of EA, I won't comment on working conditions except to say that I have continued to work there as a game designer for nearly 4 years now. Right now I'm running PTA for some of my fellow employees.<br/><br/>I try to think of ways to work story gaming concepts into the games I work on professionally, but there are rarely moments of direct influence, even when I've worked on RPGs. Honestly, story games usually don't translate into the rigid world of video games all that well. Instead, I find story games are more useful in that they make me think about what games are and can be in ways that are different from other types of games.<br/><br/>What he says about traditional screenwriters having trouble with player agency is absolutely correct, though. If you're a solid writer with an understanding of the challenges involved, you could do worse than try to raise the value of my stock.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108034">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/peccable" title="peccable"><img alt="peccable" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/peccable">peccable</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108034/#Comment_108034" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-12T21:18:02+00:00" title="November 12, 2007  9:18PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I actually co-wrote one of these (a story-based NWN module).<br/><br/>About two years ago, Bioware ran a writer's competition.  A max number of words ... (10,000-30,000? I think), 3 characters, one room.  Go for it.  Tell a story.<br/><br/>It was an interesting experience.  We ended up writing a little thing called "The Isle": <a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Modules.Detail&amp;id=4563" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Modules.Detail&amp;id=4563</a>.<br/><br/>We ended up getting decent reviews (8.52 out of 10 according to the site) and were somewhere in the top ... 20? 30? 50? out of 300.  High enough to look impressive, but not high enough to place. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I thought the top choices had the opportunity to work with Bioware.  Guess that didn't work out as well as they'd hoped.<br/><br/>The scripting language for the original NWN is...interesting.  Not very straightforward if you ask me (and this is someone who's programmed in Interactive Fiction languages like Inform 6, which pretty much defined "not very straightforward").<br/><br/>Also, be warned: it's buggy.  Almost all of the problems I ran into during the development of the module ended up being some weird bug/feature in the program.  Functions whose descriptions were outright lies, etc.  Still, there's plenty of tutorials on the web if you're looking for them.<br/><br/>I have no idea if the above applies to the new NWN2, but the game wasn't even done by the original team, so I can't help but think that things are *worse* in the sequel.<br/><br/>RE: Player agency, I think we handled it pretty well.  We'd had some experience with pure-text IF, which I'm sure helped.  It's a matter of limiting choice while giving the illusion of unlimited choice.  It comes down to the combinatorial effect: everything you add has to interact with everything you've already put in.  Making character agency limited to a few general choices while still seeming believable is an interesting balancing act.<br/><br/>-d-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_108077">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108077/#Comment_108077" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-13T08:28:12+00:00" title="November 13, 2007  8:28AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            *Headscratch*<br/><br/>I'm vaguely acquianted with, like, five or six different BioWare people.
