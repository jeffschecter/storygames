                    I've started this thread in response to Jonathan Walton's, "A New Anthem." You can check that out right here:<br/>

<br/>
This is my first post, so I may screw up the formating.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to focus more tightly on designing for Freeform games, and less on general response. To do that we will need to agree on a few things; That Freeform exists, and that you can design rules to aid it.<br/>
<br/>
Freeform gaming tends to be described as just talking, or ignoring the rules. I think that is mainly because there aren't alot of systems that gear specifically for that playstyle. This may be because these games are seen as not using rules which I hope to show isn't true. In the game I'm presently designing called Outside my rules point towards some of the unwritten rules, I believe. While the game is not Freeform it  seems like it lies somewhere between Forgie games and Freeform. If you want to see it in it's pre-playtest state:<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://outside.trailingellipse.com/pdf/Outside_point_eight.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://outside.trailingellipse.com/pdf/Outside_point_eight.pdf</a><br/>
<br/>
This will be updated somewhat frequently. The part that points to freeform is the ownership rules starting on page 3. Anyway enough whoring, let me get to my point.<br/>
<br/>
Alright, so now we enter where I would like to focus the discussion. I believe there are several unwritten rules for Freefrom games. They are:<br/>
<ul class="bbcode_list">
<li>Players play in Actor stance. That is decisions are made based on the perceptions and knowledge of the fictional character, not the player. So much so that there are terms for knowledge, in character knowledge and out of character knowledge. Making decisions with out of character knowledge is refered to as meta-gaming, and frowned upon.</li>
<li>Players are the final arbiters of their characters emotional state and thought processes.</li>
<li>Players don't typically create setting, or for games that allow player created settings those settings are usually not a main element of the game.</li>
<li>The setting is typically under GM control.</li>
<li>The GM is the arbiter of any limits. This includes setting, powers, npc's, etc.</li>
<li>Story is typically created by the GM presenting things, and then players responding to those GM created elements, as characters.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
Does this match up to other peoples experiences?<br/>
<br/>
I believe this is why people who play freeform stress "trust." I think trust is generated by observing that someone follows these unwritten rules. Since the rules have been unwritten there has been no other option other than trust.<br/>
<br/>
So what games are popular with Freefrom gamers? I would put two games forward. Amber and Nobilis. Why? Both games dispense with randomness, and instead use what I would like to call attribute scales. An attribute in a normal game is mainly used as something that adds to or subtracts from randomness. for instance in D+D if my character has a 17 strength, and if someone else has an 18 strength, that character is sort of stronger than mine. What I mean by sort of is if I roll well my character could beat the other character in a tug of war. In a game using attribute scales I can't beat the stronger player at tug of war, unless I can rationalize the use of an attribute where I'm superior to the other player, then the decision is made by Gm fiat. An example might be if I'm superior in endurance (Amber), or ropes are my domain (Nobilis). Attribute scales reduce handling time and system contact. Powers tend to be based on attribute scales also, so conflict be determined quickly. I would go so far to suggest that these systems may actually limit conflict since outcomes can be determined quickly. Wrestling Gerard is dangerous, and I'm likely to avoid that option.<br/>
<br/>
Conclusion: To design games for Freeform you need to address who narrates when and the narrative limits of both players and GM. You also need to have attributes and powers that are designed to detemine who wins in a straight out confrontation with the briefest contact of system.                </div>

                            Wow.  My experience with freeform gaming is exactly the opposite of those points...  No strong GM presence, no stigma on metagaming, etc.  We may be talking about different styles of freeform, though.  I'm only familiar with the online kind.                        </div>

                            To expand a little on what WiredNavi said: what you are describing is only one kind of freeform, specifically what we call the Immersive-Freeform. This is the most popular one that I know of and is my favorite kind of freeform, but there are certainly other kinds as well and they differ considerably from what you've described (Freeform-Storyteller, Consensus, and All-GM all pop immediately to mind, and I'm beginning to think I should write something up on how these kinds differ from each other).<br><br>Different kinds of freeform, geared toward different play experiences, will naturally require different designs.<br><br>Seeing as how you're specifically addressing Immersive-Freeform, and quite well, let's focus on that and leave the other kinds alone.<br><br>First of all, I like your list. I think you're definitely on the right track, and your point about attribute scales is spot on as far as I'm converned. Attribute scales are awesome, and are extremly popular with freeformers because they constrain the near-complete GM control without requiring any handling during the game - if we know someone's stronger then someone else, we can just integrate it into play. We already know it, we don't have to break from play to establish it.<br><br>I would like to note on two items of your list, though, just to establish differences in style (which indicates areas should be designed more loosely):<br><br>First off, players can create setting pieces. This is usually limited to things that have to do with their characters, such as organizations, NPCs, conspiracies or anything else, and while these setting pieces are under GM control like all the rest they are often the most important. After all, if the players already specified what they're interested in, why not use it? Creating setting pieces can be one of the player's main ways of specifying i&gt;from inside the game what they'd like to deal with.<br><br>And as for the GM presenting the story and the players responding to it... yeah, that happens a lot, but it's in no way required. A lot of times they players will bring up their own agendas and push it themselves, instead of waiting for the GM to bait them with it. This is another one of the player's ways of showing what they're interested in and would like to be featured in the game. The beatutiful part about this is that <i>it doesn't matter design-wise</i>. There is no importance in this style of play who pushes who, the GM or the players, because the mechanism they use to do so is organic to this playing style - either the characters do something, or the GM has stuff happen. The only important part about this is establishing it upfront in the social contract - who has the responsability to moving the story? How much are the players required to be proactive? How "open" vs. railroaded should the game be? These are all matters of taste, and bear no importance on the game design. It's only important that people be aware of them and establish them in advance so that no one if left unsatisfied because no one ended up pushing, or too many people pushed in too many directions.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

<b>WiredNavi:</b> Interesting. I've only done tabletop. Is the type of Freeform gaming you are refering to Chat based, Forum based, Internet Telephony based, or some mixture up to and including all options? I imagine Chat based would be difficult to establish a strong GM presence.<br/>
<br/>
What are the accepted limitations on narration. Can my character; chop off someones head, kick someones shin, control thoughts or emotions, pick a pocket? How are disputes resolved? I imagine the people you play with is much more difficult to control via the internet, so there must be some disputes.<br/>
<br/>
Can you outline what some of the unwritten rules are a bit more broadly?<br/>
<br/>
<b>Anders Larsen:</b> That's an absolutely great point. I hadn't considered setting response rules for the GM.<br/>
<br/>
Are flags typically part of the game design you play, does your group create them in addition to the rules of the game at chargen, or do you have techniques to wave them during the game?<br/>
<br/>
<b>Nir Shiffer:</b> Can you point me to where you've gotten the names for different freeform styles from? It sounds like some info I need to learn.<br/>
<br/>
I'm curious... you say it doesn't matter design-wise, as long as a social contract is established. Do you believe that design can help establish that social contract more openly, or is the contract too variable for a designer to choose one that is likely to work for a decent subset of Freeform gaming groups?                        </div>

                            I have three rules that I always try to keep to as a GM. These are:<br><br>1) The characters should face interesting challenges (this is what most people call bangs).<br>2) The surroundings should react on what the characters do and are.<br>3) The Player should feel that his character can make a difference.<br><br>I, of course, GM in a number of systems, and only a few of them have anything resembling flags. But I always try to follow the three rules, and I can do it because I know my players very well.<br><br>The motivation for the three rules are:<br><br>Rule 1: Will make the game more exiting for the player.<br>Rule 2: If the player feels that the surroundings react on his character, he will feel more a part of the fiction; he will be more immersed.<br>Rule 3: Is what makes the player come back to the table every week.<br><br>It is important to note, that in rule 2, it is not only what the character do, but also what they <i>are</i>, that should get an reaction. If the character is described as being dark with a scary look, people that meet him should be afraid of him, and it should be possible for him to use it as an advantage in a conflict. You will be surprised what pleaser this will give a player.<br><br>I would really like to see a game that help (or enforces) the GM to use these rules (or rules like this).<br><br>The game I run where I best can use this, is actually a diceless and relatively ruleless game. The character only have a set of Descriptors (which essentially is flags). In this rpg there is no gamist pleasure to have, there is only immersion and roleplay. <br/><br/>One more note: In this rpg I have no well-structured setting, and only a vague idea of a story, when the game starts. Everything is created depending on what the characters do. It seems to work best this way.<br/><br/> - Anders                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

<i>"Can you point me to where you've gotten the names for different freeform styles from?"</i><br/><br/>I minted them. Or, to be exact, I translated them from existing theory material that's in Hebrew. As far as I know there's very little material on freeform in English, because the English-speaking indie scene (low-impact games almost always originate with independent desginers, not mainstream) has been focusing on other things. There's a lot of material in the Israeli scene and the Nordic scene (Sweden/Finland/Norway mostly, I think), but the language(s) barrier is a problem.<br/><br/>As for the social contract:<br/><br/>I think that it's a good idea to put it on the table. Traditionally a lot of things in the SC are implied, and that's fine as long as you always play with the same people and you're all synchronized about these things, but it becomes a problem when you try to incorporate new people into the game and you can't articulate exactly what's expected from them. This also makes it hard for these new players to protest, becasue they have nothing to point to and offer a change - it's not that they're "not pushing the game enough" , or "keep blocking the GM's plot", they're just "doing it wrong". We should eliminate the no-explanations-available "doing it wrong".<br/><br/>So I think the first thing a design like this should do is make people -aware- of the social contract. They should know what's in it, and they should be able to agree <b>before starting the game</b> what the SC's going to be. This might not be design of the game per se, but it can be invaluable to these kinds of games.<br/><br/>Once you've put the SC on the table and people know what it is and what it means, you can go ahead and say "we recommend that for this game you use this social contract that says so and so, because it works like so and so and that's the experience we designed the game for". I believe that you can design a game around a specific social contract, but you have to realize in advance that it's not going to work for everybody. Some people will want to change some things, some people might want a different social cotract altogether.<br/><br/>That's why teaching people how construct their own social contracts in a cause-effect aware fashion is key. Not everyone will want to play your game like it is. You are giving them the tools to take it and change into the game <b>they</b> want.                        </div>

                            Clyde - Most of my experiences with freeform roleplaying are from about 5 years ago, so things may have changed.  Even then I roleplayed pretty much exclusively in AOL chat rooms.  I did a little forum-based stuff, but it didn't hold my attention.<br/>
<br/>
There were no formal 'rules' to speak of apart from those that groups put together to use internally.  The forums were totally user-run and characters ran the gamut from Dragonball Z to perfectly normal individuals.  Many of the players either wanted to play characters they knew and loved (it was amusing when more than one of them would end up in the same chatroom...) or were interested in moment-to-moment emotional drama.  Characters would form deep emotional ties at the drop of a hat, mostly out of a desire by the players to create compelling plot with little else to interact with.<br/>
<br/>
There were some common expectations.  The most common was 'Nothing happens to my character that I don't agree to'.  It was generally considered extremely bad form to write another character's actions for them or stating that anything bad happened to another person's character; if you wanted to hit another character, you narrated trying to hit them and let their player react as they would.  The corollary to this, of course, was that it was also considered bad form and a sign of immaturity ('maturity' being highly prized, and a codeword which essentially meant 'worth interacting with') to create a character who was stupendously powerful and/or to refuse to allow other characters to affect yours.<br/>
<br/>
Because of the total lack of a formalized setting or character creation system, there was a great emphasis on 'fairness'.  If you wanted to have your extremely powerful character get into some kind of conflict with another one on an equal footing, great, but it was bad form to pick on people who chose to play less powerful characters.  Generally, those people who powergamed in that way were percieved as bullies and ignored.<br/>
<br/>
Eloquence in writing (combined with reasonable speed in replying) was highly prized, both in describing the situation and writin an evocative character description.  Occasionally this would lead to some of the most atrocious use of the English language I've ever read when people tried to use.  There were some phrases and catchwords that people would place in their character descriptions indicating the kind of roleplay the player were looking for or would engage in ('Mature/21+', 'Continuous Storyline', and so forth being the most common ones).<br/>
<br/>
Disputes were resolved very informally.  If someone's narrated something you don't like or don't think they have authority for, you could ask them to retract it, or if you can live with it  you can suck it up.  If someone repeatedly narrates stuff you don't like or doesn't listen when you explain what kind of game you're trying to have, you just ignore them and play with someone else.  Essentially, the whole thing was social contract-based, with everyone capable of ignoring the people who didn't approximate their ideal of the social contract.<br/>
<br/>
There were a lot of groups that went beyond this, usually by tacking awkward dice mechanics onto stuff like hitting people.  I tended to shy away from that, and it seemed to appeal more to people who were very into powergaming-as-prestige.  There were also a great many freeform games using essentially the rules I'm describing which were 'closed', not interacting with other players, and usually based around some kind of fandom (anime, TV shows, etc.); these reminded me a little bit of the fanfic community.                        </div>
