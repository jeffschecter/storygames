Since then I have been slowly refining it and working on it, playtesting it here and there (you would be amazed at how hard it is to find players willing to help me playtest my weird games) and generally working ever so slowly towards eventual publication. Or something to that effect anyway.<br/><br/>The thing is, Im not satisfied. Not at all. There are major issues with it that I see no way around at present.<br/><br/>Im posting the game-text, raw, sans fluff or anything that doesnt absolutely need to be there to convey the general idea, in the hopes that someone can help me in the right direction.<br/><br/>Some of the issues I have with it I have plans for, like the awkward (though IMO awesome) tarot-based mechanic, which is probably getting dumped in favour of a d10.<br/><br/>Anyway, here it is:<br/><br/>Arkana; Beyond, Behind is a roleplaying game for 2 to 4 players.<br/><br/>To play Arkana, you need a deck of Tarot-cards, a copy of this book and some friends to play with. Tarot-cards can be found in most book stores, as well as certain occult shops and various online stores. I recommend the RIder-Waite cards because of their appropriate and symbolic artwork, but any Tarot deck will do just fine. If you dont know much about the Tarot, you could find one of many fine handbooks on the subject, commonly found in many bookstores and occult shops, but you dont have to. You can get by just fine with being inspired by the strange pictures on the cards.<br/><br/>Characters<br/><br/>Before the story can begin, the players need to make characters to play in the story.<br/><br/>In Arkana you play magicians, men and women who in one way or another have discovered the land Beyond, Behind, a world of metaphor and dark symbolism, or met the Fair Folk and witnessed their power.<br/>The moment a person meets the forces from Beyond, Behind, their lives are forever changed. From now on his life is ruled by different laws than everybody else. Strange events and impossible coincidences lead him into contact with the land behind the mirror with more and more frequency. From that first moment of contact, he shines like a bright beacon in the eyes of the Fae; he and everyone around him are drawn into the plots and intrigues of the Shining Host.<br/><br/>A magician cannot himself perform magic. Mankind is not ment to wield the awesome forces of magic,and not even mortals with the blood of the Fae in their veins can do much more than innocent parlor-tricks that barely touch the magical Beyond, Behind. But those who are touched by the land behind the mirror do hold a certain power over magic. The laws of the elven kingdoms are not like in our world, and through knowing and understanding these laws an experienced magician can subjugate the Fae, forcing them into servitude. But it is dangerous. The Fair Folk do not like being ordered around and exploited, and Fae who have been made servants can be malicious, vindictive, treacherous and rebellious creatures.<br/><br/>There is a black market among magicians. They trade in secrets, names and faery slaves. They plot and scheme against one another, they betray and stab backs and lie and cheat. There is real hate down in that underworld.<br/>Some take on pupils, which they exploit, abuse and even sell or trade away to faery kings or other magicians who have some use or other for them.<br/>They are driven by ambition, madness and greed. They deal in slavery and deciet, and those professions attract a very specialkind of people. A nasty kind.<br/><br/>There is a market among faerykind too, and just like the magicians black market it is a vicious, frightening thing. The fae trade in souls, dreams, hopes and desires. To them we are lovers, slaves, food and even decorations. <br/>Mysterious as it may seem, mortals are at the centre of everything that goes on in the faery kingdoms Beyond, Behind. We are like ants to them, pathetic insects barely worthy of their attention; and yet they hate us, love us, fear us and desire us. For all our insignificance, we have something that they want, that they know they dont have and will never have: We have souls.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138188">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Temple" title="Temple"><img alt="Temple" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b340/kreutzer/ubt.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Temple">Temple</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138188/#Comment_138188" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-04T12:36:16+00:00" title="April  4, 2008 12:36PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When you make a character you can either start with  an idea of who you want to play, or just start and discover who the character is as you go along.<br/><br/>We start with the characters Colors. All characters have four Colors, which are the same as the suits of the Tarot:<br/><br/>-Cup: Who the character is, Name, appearance, details of his life and background.<br/><br/>-Sword: Goals and desires, the reasons why the character dabbles in magic.<br/><br/>-Coin: Interesting things the character knows, owns or can do, items of special interest you want the story to contain.<br/><br/>-Wand: What kind of magic the character studies or practices, where and how he learned it, any Faery servantsor teachers he has and any curses or blessings cast upon him.<br/><br/>Write a couple of sentences for each color, a general description that says something about your character, no more than 30 words. Dont get specific! Youll get to the details of the Color afterwards.<br/><br/>Once youve done this, write down two things for each color that are especially important to you; these things are the characters Strengths.<br/><br/>From the Cup, write down two persons from the characters family or circle of friends who are especially important to your character.<br/><br/>From the Sword, write down two concrete things, hopes or goals your character wants to accomplish.<br/><br/>From the Coin, write down two abilities or material posessions the character has.<br/><br/>From the Wand, write down two persons or objects that are important to your characters performance of magic.<br/><br/>Lastly pick one Strenght and Harm it (see the section on How to Play the game for more on Danger).<br/><br/>At the end of every session, add 15 words to a Color of your choice, and give that Color a new Strength.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138189">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Temple" title="Temple"><img alt="Temple" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b340/kreutzer/ubt.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Temple">Temple</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138189/#Comment_138189" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-04T12:39:44+00:00" title="April  4, 2008 12:39PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Example character:<br/><br/>Cup: Jonathan Wilkes, a young magician who found an entrance to the realm Beyond, Behind in his grandfathers dusty old diary.

This is the Story Pattern, and it is a tool to help you improvise the story you are going to tell. <br/>Look at the cards, and talk between you about what they could represent. A card could be a person or group of people, an event of significance, and object or even a mood or theme for the story. If you know the symbolic meanings of the cards, you could use that as a guide, but you dont have to. You could just as easily draw inspiration from the names and pictures of the cards. <br/>The Magician, to pick a random example, could represent both the act of creation as a means to power and an actual magician.<br/><br/>Once youve established the Story Pattern, you can begin to play the game.<br/>Whenever there is a conflict, we draw cards from the Minor Arkana and compare the values (between 1-14). The player with the highest number describes the outcome of the conflict. If a conflict involves one or more of a characters Strengths, the player adds 1 to his value for each Strength involved.<br/>The way the cards come up is also important. A card up-side down means unforeseen, negative consequences. This effect is independent of winning or losing the conflict.<br/>The other players and the GM decide what this effect is.<br/><br/>Win, negative card: Yes, But.. Something unforeseen happens,you lose something, you are forced to sacrifice something valuable, you foster a negative relationship etc..<br/><br/>Loss, negative card: No, And.. Something unforeseen happens,you lose something, you are forced to sacrifice something valuable, you foster a negative relationship etc..                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Temple" title="Temple"><img alt="Temple" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b340/kreutzer/ubt.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Temple">Temple</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138192/#Comment_138192" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-04T12:42:46+00:00" title="April  4, 2008 12:42PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If the loser of a conflicts wants to, he can place a Strength in Danger in order to draw a new card and add its value to the value of his original card.<br/>If the new card is negative, the result is tainted. Only one STrength may be in Danger per conflict, and you may only place a Strength in Danger 4 times.<br/><br/>When a Strength is in Danger for the first time, it is Threatened. Write Threatened next to the Strength on your character sheet. A Threatened Strength is under the eye of the Fair Folk. <br/>Tell the other players how the world Beyond, Behind is right now, at this very moment contacting or affecting the Threatened Strength.<br/><br/>If a Strength is placed in Danger a second time, the Strength is Harmed. Write Harmed next to the Strength on your character sheet. When a Strength is Harmed, tell the other players how the Fair Folk are damaging, threatening or hurting it right now!<br/><br/>If a Strength is placed in Danger a third time, the Strength is Taken; Faeries steal it away to the lands behind the mirror. Write Taken next to the Strength on the character sheet, and tell the other players how the strength is stolen from your character at this very moment!<br/><br/>A Strength that is placed in Danger a fourth and final time is gone. Simply erase it from the character sheet and tell the other players how the Strength is killed or destroyed by the Fae right here, right now.<br/><br/>If a player runs out of cards, he can Harm a Strength (as if it had been placed in Danger 3 times) in order to reshuffle his Minor Arkana.<br/><br/>If more than two characters are involved in a conflict, they all compare values and compete for the right to narrate the outcome.<br/><br/>If two or more characters are cooperating, designate a main character for that conflict. That characters player draws a card, and adds both his own and any cooperating characters Strengths involved in the conflict to the value.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Temple" title="Temple"><img alt="Temple" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b340/kreutzer/ubt.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Temple">Temple</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138193/#Comment_138193" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-04T12:43:03+00:00" title="April  4, 2008 12:43PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The GM<br/><br/>The rules work slightly differently for the GM.<br/>When an NPC is involved in a conflict, the GM draws cards for that NPC, not for himself, This means that at the end of any conflict, the GM simply reshuffles his cards into his Minor Arkana.<br/><br/>Both magicians and fae have Power instead of STrengths, a number from 0-5 that is added to the value of the cards the GM draws for them.<br/><br/>Generally, values values between 0-2 are most common, representing moderately powerful magicians or weak fae. Power 3-4 indicates a very powerful magician or an average to moderately powerful fae, while Power of 5 is reserved for the most powerful of the Fair Folk kings and queens. <br/><br/>Making NPCs is easy. Ordinary people need no stats. Magicians have only Power, usually somewhere between 1 and 3.<br/><br/>The fae are slightly different. Since they are creatures of immense, unfathomable magical power, they are difficult to model accurately in a roleplaying game. So I dont even try to. The Fae are, under the right circumstances, practically omnipotent.<br/>Fae power, then, is a matter of what limitations are placed on the individual faery, either by its superiors or by the strange nature of the kingdom Beyond, Behind itself.<br/><br/>Every Fae has Bindings,which are restrictions on when, where and how it can work its magic. This is what makes some Fae more or less powerful than others.<br/><br/>Very weak Fae will have either very many Bindings (sometimes as many as 10) or a few really restrictive ones. These are the ones most often encountered as slaves or servants to magicians.<br/>The most powerful, the Dukes and Baronesses, the Kings and Queens, have very few, very weak Bindings.<br/><br/>Example weak Bindings:<br/>Cannot work magic when wet.<br/>Cannot work magic between 12 PM and 01 AM.<br/>Cannot work magic on infants.<br/>Cannot work magic when touching plastic.<br/>Cannot work magic when aroused.<br/><br/>Can only work magic after having eaten.<br/>Can only work magic when angry.<br/>Can only work magic when touching the ground.<br/>Can only work magic with one eye closed.<br/>Can only work magic on adults.<br/><br/>Example strong Bindings:<br/>Cannot work magic during the day.<br/>Cannot work magic close to water.<br/>Cannot work magic on women.<br/>Cannot work magic outdoors.<br/>Cannot work magic indoors.<br/><br/>Can only work magic on fridays.<br/>Can only work magic under the full moon.<br/>Can only work magic when in love.<br/>Can only work magic in a stone structure.<br/>Can only work magic on children.<br/><br/>In addition, there are a number of laws that all fae must obey:<br/><br/>A faery can not break a promise or a sworn oath.<br/>A faery called by his true name must obey.<br/>A faery can not lie if asked directly.<br/>A faery can not enter a home uninvited. <br/>A fae in slavery or captivity can not voluntarily harm its master, by magic or violence.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Temple" title="Temple"><img alt="Temple" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b340/kreutzer/ubt.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Temple">Temple</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138196/#Comment_138196" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-04T12:44:57+00:00" title="April  4, 2008 12:44PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So thats it.

Fae power, then, is a matter of what limitations are placed on the individual faery, either by its superiors or by the strange nature of the kingdom Beyond, Behind itself.</blockquote>\nWhat, specifically, is the problem with this?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138205">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Temple" title="Temple"><img alt="Temple" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b340/kreutzer/ubt.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Temple">Temple</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138205/#Comment_138205" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-04T13:05:49+00:00" title="April  4, 2008  1:05PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hehe, sorry for being unclear.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Willow">@Willow</a>: The Major Issues are as follows:<br/>Players running out of cards. Its deprotagonising to just have them sitting there without cards, with no real way of contributing. Its a weak solution.<br/>I feel that the insane power level of the main antagonists, the Fae, are not being dealt with in a productive manner. The binding restrictions Ive placed on them are first of all very arbitrary, secondly very hard to come up with, and thirdly difficult to use in play. I just feel like Im dealing with them in a completely wrong way, but Im not sure how to proceed.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Jason">@Jason</a>: The d10 thing is, to my mind, very easy to do so I didnt actually implement it into the rules I posted here. I just copy-pasted what I had, figuring it was short enough to get the point across. Maybe that was a bad move, but its been made now in any case.<br/>Just mentally replace any reference to cards with dice. The system, at its core, remains exactly the same in either incarnation. Its just rolling dice and adding numbers instead of drawing cards and adding numbers.<br/><br/>As for your quote, Im not actually unhappy with that. Thats just the way I want it. Im just concerned about the way the rules I have written down right now are reflecting that as the rules are written now.<br/><br/>Sorry for burdening you with tons of raw text like this. Im sure its pretty uninteresting to read some random guys raw manuscript, especially in a format like this. I have no website to upload any documents to though, and as I said I figured it was short enough to read without much trouble. My bad I guess.<br/><br/>Anyway, keep asking questions if you feel like helping! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
