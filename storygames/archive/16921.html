It's me and two other people, which is admittedly on the low side for playing (I don't have the book with me at the moment, but I'm pretty sure Matteo says that 4-6 is the sweet spot, right?).<br/><br/>Is anyone else playing?<br/>If so, what's awesome about the game?<br/>While we're on the topic, what's confusing about it?<br/><br/>I'm playing a guy named Django, who's got some strong activist/anarchist leanings. I chose the Sympathy | Judgment dichotomy for him, and it's my goal to max out both of them. I know we're not <i>really</i> supposed to pre-play those dichotomies, but I see him as someone who feels the suffering of his friends really deeply, and offers no forgiveness in seeking justice on their behalf. Batman meets protest kid.<br/><br/>We're confused about how to start the game without "contra-intentions" but still have them emerge during play. Is it a slow-burn thing, or do we look to find them as soon as scene one starts? Contra-intentions are the most confusing part of the game for me, partially because what they <i>are</i> is never really explained.<br/><br/>Tell me about your experiences!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_385461">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WPTunes" title="WPTunes"><img alt="WPTunes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/193/nI9P6PIU22T8F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WPTunes">WPTunes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385461/#Comment_385461" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-19T19:58:42+00:00" title="July 19, 2012  7:58PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Sure, contra-intentions can be confusing, but if you're really playing it <em>right</em>, they flow naturally from play.

We used the coastal city options and came up with a mid-sized metropolis with a heavy emphasis on shipping and fishing.<br/><br/>I was playing as an artist-type named Marla, with the Leader | Detachment dichotomy.  She wound up the head of a new artist collective, but had a difficult time resolving any Relationship Ties.  I did really enjoy playing out the struggle against her isolationist tendencies, and the one Tie I did resolve came about in a particularly excellent scene with another player character, Sheena (Nurture | Obsession). I also felt like the work done through the collective made a tangible, positive impact on the city's cultural side.<br/><br/>The most confusing thing for me was how to use the city's characteristics in between scenes.  I get that it's meant to give the environment some life and create some extra narrative material, but on my turns to do something with the city, I felt like my choices didn't end up making a difference.  Anyone have advice on making more effective decisions?<br/> <br/>With regard to contra-intentions, Paul has it right. These came up in play for us kind of at their own pace. We didn't make a concerted effort or anything initially, not wanting it to feel forced. For my part, I waited until it was obvious and used it in the next available scene to create friction.  That's how I interpreted them to work; other folks may have taken a different approach, though.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/WPTunes">@WPTunes</a> - See, I really liked the acrostic.  I thought it went a long way to create a good sense of the initial relationships between the characters and the city without needing to resort to a lengthy background creation process.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_385467">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385467/#Comment_385467" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-19T20:36:26+00:00" title="July 19, 2012  8:36PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            WPTunes,<br/><br/>Can you talk more about your dislike of the Acrostic?

I understand that it certainly speeds up development of a "web of connections" but it feels more than a bit limiting to me (and to my group). I admit we did have some good results with the Rust Belt mode and DECAY, but that seems pretty obvious.<br/><br/>I am *loving* my character, though. Her name, coincidentally enough, is also Marla. She's a guerilla gardener with the Nature | Rationalism dichotomy, and it makes for a great set of internal choices that have mechanical implications that reflect in the fiction. (Insert something about clouds and arrows here... I don't really get that stuff.)<br/><br/>Relationship Ties are actually pretty easy if you don't put too much worry into resolving them. Despite the fact that your character starts off with at least a few Ties, it's far more satisfying if you let them ride for a while, *feel* the constraints they place on the character's choices grow in urgency, and then resolve them when they're fully ripened.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_385472">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385472/#Comment_385472" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-19T21:39:18+00:00" title="July 19, 2012  9:39PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Relationship Ties are actually pretty easy if you don't put too much worry into resolving them.
