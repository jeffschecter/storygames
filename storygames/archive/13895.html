All my preparatory material is <a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/games//hwctlh/curse_of_antelope_woman.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and I thought I'd talk about my experience a little.<br/><br/>I really like How We Came To Live Here and was excited to share it with people who hadn't played before. I was super lucky to get three excellent players - Patty, Sam and Jenskot, who are also friends of mine - and a quiet room, <i>and </i>no alternates, <i>and </i>one less player than expected. So we played in a quiet, private room, with the game's sweet spot - two heroes and two GMs. Jenskot and I were outside and inside GM respectively, Patty played She Laughs Like A hawk, and Sam played He Stands Like A Mountain. Some lessons learned follow.<br/><br/>Lesson one: I really over-prepared. I figured a convention session really demanded pre-gens and a solid situation to get things rolling fast, and I don't think I'm wrong about this. I knew that once everyone got their hands on the material all bets were off, but I felt compelled to provide both structure (a detailed set of relationships in crisis) and many options for where that situation could go. It turns out that you really only need the initial setup and pre-gens for a con game of HWCTLH to work well. All the extra stuff was just extra stuff Jenskot had to read through before doing his own thing. Trust in the game to provide and approach it more casually. Maybe have a few cool ideas if you know you'll be a GM, but the level of detail and optional stuff I worked up was not necessary. Only about 25% of it entered play, really, primarily driven by relationships. The r-map was really useful - essential, even.<br/><br/>Lesson two: Players have everything they need to bring it at the table. Characters cannot help but be full of direct flags toward both conflict and resolution options. Once we turned them loose, they carved their own paths.<br/><br/>Lesson three: The threat tracks are paced very well for a single four hour session. Two heroes, seven or so meaty conflicts, done. I chose one that hit them hard and then tapered off and that was great. Three heroes seems like it might be problematic in the convention setting.<br/><br/>lesson four: Something I did very right was to start the pre-gens at slightly higher levels in their kiva societies, giving them artifacts and, importantly, initial corruption. 3 or 4 points is enough to prime the pump. We didn't give the GMs bonus dice to compensate and they weren't really needed.<br/><br/>In our game, Antelope Woman was a genuine monster. The central themes were identity and paranoia, with a monster (and later, monsters) in the community who could change form and masquerade as good villagers. This resulted in a cascade of corruption as the heroes fought the problem from multiple directions. He Stands Like A Mountain ended a major conflict in a compromise that set up all kinds of future disaster (encourage compromises and outright fleeing). In the end the village was torn apart, but in a way that signaled some hope for the future. Both heroes were children of the outside chief, and over the course of play his relationship with each of them turned to hate, and he finally abdicated his responsibility. There was one dramatic supernatural conflict and a number of slightly more subdued social conflicts.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_314733">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314733/#Comment_314733" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-28T10:45:14+00:00" title="February 28, 2011 10:45AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I need to play this sometime.

I was slated to do so on Saturday, but unfortunately only one person showed up. I got to play Fiasco instead (which was brilliant in every way, so it all turned out great), but I still had that pang of regret. <br/><br/>As a result, though, I'm very curious about some of the details of your session. My questions:<br/><br/>(1) Did you use the Names as traits? I remember Brennan saying that was something he had meant to do, by putting a box up by the Names, and I had been planning on doing that in my own game. I'm curious if the three names you have listed for each character were 3 full traits.<br/><br/>(2) Which threat track did you use, exactly? I'm pretty sure I know, but I want to be certain. Did it feel like the tension diminished towards the end because of the dwindling pools held by the Inside and Outside Players, or were the characters' resources depleted enough by the initial onslaught to keep up the tension? Or did the characters have lots of power in the final conflicts, and that was awesome even though it was likely from the outset that they were going to win? (One way or another I'm assuming there was excellence.)<br/><br/>(3) How did ambition generation go? Was it difficult? Easy? Quick? Did you fill in all the ambitions you wanted at the beginning, or were they filled in later during play? How important were they to driving the game? <br/><br/>(4) How did you determine the exact amount of corruption and advancement to give the characters? When I was setting up my pre-gens, I was very conservative, going only 2nd rank in Kivas (though logically, I really should've gone further), and giving out no initial Corruption points. Was this sort of an "eyeball it" situation? Did you just go with what felt right? <br/><br/>(5) I take it from what you described, next time you would not go into the game with a preordained relationship map, correct? Did you fill in the village web in this game? Would it fill the same role as your pre-made map? If you did fill in the web, how long did it take?<br/><br/>Thanks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_314747">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314747/#Comment_314747" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-28T11:36:16+00:00" title="February 28, 2011 11:36AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 28, 2011 11:45AM by jenskot.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How We Came To Live Here is an excellent game. I'm good friends with Brennan so I'm biased but this was the first time I've played and it surpassed all my expectations. That said, I can't speak to the game text itself as I have not read it. But if it communicates what I experienced, that's a great sign and I know Brennan hired an excellent editor. <br/><br/>Out of a long list of positives, I only saw 2 potential issues, both possibly tied to convention play:<br/><br/>1. Players earn corruption to roll more dice but that same corruption can be immediately spent in the same conflict to give the GM the same number of dice. It feels like a zero sum situation. That said, the GM can spend corruption to do more than just roll more dice. Which I believe will come out more in extended play (or with more experienced GMs). Based on my very limited experience I would be tempted to say that corruption earned in a conflict can't be immediately spent by the GM in the same conflict. <br/><br/>2. Whenever a player's back is to the wall in a conflict and needs more dice, they have a considerable list of options to choose from. This means inexperienced players will effectively pause the conflict's narration as they a. read through lists b. weigh their options c. struggle with the decision since most are non-trivial. This becomes less an issue as players gain more experience and the fiction begins to dictate what options are and are not available (making the list and choices smaller).<br/><br/>Both of these potential issues were ultimately minor and easily compensated for or simply go away in different circumstances. <br/><br/>A while ago I was designing a game called Blackout which is eerily similar to How We Came To Live Here. Everything from the character details to how conflicts go back and forth to corruption to spending points and so on. Except I think this is a better game! If I ever run Blackout again, I would just use How We Came To Live Here instead. <br/><br/>In fact I will buy a copy this week!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_314749">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314749/#Comment_314749" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-28T11:44:17+00:00" title="February 28, 2011 11:44AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The relationship map was crucial. I'm glad we had that established before play. Towards the end, we were slightly lost on what the last conflict should be and who should be in it but the relationship map refocused us and it all concluded in a satisfying and thematically consistent manner. <br/><br/>The GM prep notes were great at making me feel I had something to fall back on and eager to jump into a GM role for a game I had never played. It was likely more an emotional crutch rather than something that was required. Once the game starts, so much can change and everything the players do is so impactful filled with meaningful choices that prep can't survive intact\u2026 and I love that!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_314754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314754/#Comment_314754" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-28T12:28:01+00:00" title="February 28, 2011 12:28PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 28, 2011 2:04PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brendan Conway</cite>(1) Did you use the Names as traits?
