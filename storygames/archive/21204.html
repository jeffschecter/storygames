Maybe this will be useful to someone out there who's designing a simple game.<br/><br/>On Amazon they sell a set of twelve blank dice.  Three are red, three yellow, three green, three white.  (<a href="http://amzn.to/2us6xbl" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://amzn.to/2us6xbl</a>.)  They come with stickers so you can write anything on the faces you want.  <br/><br/>On each of two green dice, put four stickers that say "yes" and two that say "no".  On each of two yellow dice, put three stickers that say "yes" and three that say "no".  On each of two red dice, put two stickers that say "yes" and four that say "no".  <br/><br/>If your character tries something easy, roll one green.  (66% chance of success.)  If they try something moderately difficult, roll one yellow.  (50% chance of success.)  If they try something hard, roll one red.  (33% chance of success.)  It's easy to remember the order because it's like a traffic light -- green is "go for it", yellow is "be cautious before doing this", and red is "you might be stopped!"<br/><br/>Dice colors can be relative to archetypes.  A warrior might roll green for melee attacks, but a wizard rolls red.  Vice versa for spellcasting, etc.<br/><br/>There's also a "cool or clever" mechanic.  If the character is trying to get to their goal in a clever way, or if the player just plain does something cool, they roll one extra die of the same color and get to take the best result -- i.e., take a "yes", if it appears.  Green rolls now have an 89% chance of success, yellow rolls have 75%, and red have 56%.  This incentivizes the players to do things in cool and clever ways.  If you want, you can have a rule saying that the cool or clever thing has to exemplify the character's archetype or personality.  Fighters doing fighterly things in cool or clever ways can get the extra die, but wizards have to do something cool or clever that's wizardly to get an extra die.<br/><br/>One more thing.  On one of the white dice, put two stickers that say "and", two that say "but", and leave the other two sides blank.  Roll a white die every time, no matter what else you're rolling, and attach the result to the result of colored die/dice.  For instance, if your other die/dice give you a "no" result, then 33% of the time it will be "no, but", 33% of the time it will be "no, and" and 33% of the time it will be just plain "no".  Ditto for "yes" results.<br/><br/>I could see using this dice set and mechanics for a very simple RPG, maybe a variant of something like Jason Morningstar's Dungeon Squad, or some Cthluhu Dark hack, etc.  <br/><br/>Hope this is useful to someone out there!  I thought of the dice and mechanics but I don't have a game for them (yet).<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464681">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kayfall" title="Kayfall"><img alt="Kayfall" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kayfall">Kayfall</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464681/#Comment_464681" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-07T06:14:47+00:00" title="July  7, 2017  6:14AM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like this!

I'd hesitate to call it a feature, unless you want to constrain the game to be about moderately powerful characters facing moderately challenging threats, without extreme and degenerate situations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470396">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/13Clocks" title="13Clocks"><img alt="13Clocks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/13Clocks">13Clocks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470396/#Comment_470396" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-04T21:05:52+00:00" title="March  4, 2018  9:05PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 4, 2018 9:26PM by 13Clocks.">edited March 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really like this!  It's quite a cool idea.  Two things to say:<br/>First, you can do it with normal dice too, just not as easily.  Just have characters try to beat 2, 3, or 4 on a 1d6 roll.  Essentially, you've built the stat check into the dice, which would probably be quite fun, especially for beginning players, but might be difficult to extend with such things as bonuses.<br/>Second, you already have 99% of a game.  A game needs, at minimum:<br/>1. A character creation mechanic.<br/>2. A challenge mechanic.  (You can have a special combat mechanic as well if you want, but since combat is just a violent dispute, many smaller games get away quite easily with just having the GM narrate combat as a series of difficult actions requiring stat checks.)<br/>3. A setting.<br/>You've got the first: pick which set of dice each character will use for each set of actions.  You've described the second. The third is the easiest bit, and also the most fun.  Think of the genres and story beats you like.  Do you like elves?  Do you like prohibition-era New York?  I'm already starting to imagine concept art and characters for a world where human alcohol is perfectly allowable, but elf-wine is banned as far too potent, leading to human/elf gang wars.  The key image here is Legolas in an Al Capone suit, with a submachine gun made of enchanted wood from his home forest.  My point is that settings can be made quickly, and you've already done most of the rest.  Most of the big work with a game like D&amp;D is in worldbuilding: writing out spells, monsters, and lore.  A game with such a simple challenge mechanic as yours wouldn't need all that much, and you could probably come up with enough setting for a good GM to use in a few hours at most.<br/><br/>As a quick comment, when reading a gamebook, I do generally try to consciously divide it into character creation, challenge, and setting.  Then, I can mix them up.  For example, there's nothing stopping me throwing Lady Blackbird and her allies into the setting of Apocalypse World, or vice versa -- although the character sheets in that particular example might take a little bit of preparation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470397">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/APM" title="APM"><img alt="APM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/APM">APM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470397/#Comment_470397" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-04T21:22:32+00:00" title="March  4, 2018  9:22PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/13Clocks" rel="nofollow">13Clocks</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I really like this!

It's amazing how much of a difference it makes to use different dice compared to just changing the difficulty value (beat 2, 3 or 4).<br/><br/>This is a nifty idea.
