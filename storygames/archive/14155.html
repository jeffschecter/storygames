Drama comes from contrast.<br/><br/>Although you don't want: <br/><br/>- to be predictable<br/>- the losses not to matter<br/>- your protagonist to lose so often they seem incompetent and you no longer care if they win<br/><br/>But there are no strict rules, and if the audience is so used to certain forms of storytelling\u2026 if their expectations of specific patterns are so strong\u2026 breaking the rules is a great way to create contrast, to create drama.<br/><br/>You don't need to lose most of the time. It's about quality\u2026 not quantity. One credible loss with significant consequences before the end is enough to make winning dramatic. <br/><br/>But in RPGs, this can feel counterintuitive. Drama may be the goal but your characters are honestly trying to overcome obstacles and gathering advantages to increase their chances to win. But dramatically, the more likely their tactics are sound\u2026 the more dramatic it would be for them to lose. At the same time, if you play your characters with the knowledge that you can lose your way to victory\u2026 it feels empty. It undermines the drama. The drama needs characters to be risking everything on their way to success. <br/><br/>Pro Wrestling often uses this formula poorly. Characters talk about winning their matches before a PPV to build momentum\u2026 to gain advantages\u2026 but most of the time the person who wins a match before a PPV is the person who is going to lose at that PPV. <br/><br/>The conflicts your characters face, even within a dramatic structure, have to matter. You may be able to lose your way to overall success but those losses need to hurt. Losing these conflicts means sacrifice, losing things or people you care about and paying terrible costs. <br/><br/>Now RPGs aren't stories. I've seen many RPGs feel lackluster when story became more important than playing. At the same time, RPGs aren't quite games in the traditional sense. I've also seen plenty of RPGs fall flat due to complete randomness. I suspect there is a treasure trove somewhere in the middle.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_321132">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cy" title="cy"><img alt="cy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cy">cy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321132/#Comment_321132" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-18T16:56:56+00:00" title="April 18, 2011  4:56PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">The drama needs characters to be risking everything on their way to success.</div>\n</blockquote>\nA lot of the times, risking the loss of *something* is enough to get some of this effect.  You want the thing you risk losing to be of a different kind from what the character ends up winning.  It's basically a way for the protagonist to say my end goal (the big win) is more important to me than (this thing I'm risking losing.)  This lets you set up for the potential that you'll decide what you have (or improving something that you would have to risk) is more important than what you thought you wanted at first.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes you need to lose for the risk to be plausible.  This is easier to do in a game than in a movie.  In a game, you can see the 50/50 chance that your girlfriend is going to leave you.  In a movie, they usually have to follow through (at some point at least) for the audience to take it as a credible risk (and thus have emotional/dramatic impact.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_321133">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jason" title="jason"><img alt="jason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/741/nSSKWSOUO6KV7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jason">jason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321133/#Comment_321133" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-18T17:02:42+00:00" title="April 18, 2011  5:02PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, absolutely\u2014and one of the reasons I love FATE so much.

I think the GM should be aware of this factor, but how to pull it off without railroading?  Should the GM be sitting there thinking, hmm, best if they loose this conflict so their triumph later will be more impressive?  And so chucks a bunch of extra stuff at them now and less stuff later?  railroading......?  I think so.  <br/><br/>What is the idea of fate compels?  How dose that help?<br/><br/>[edit] just looked it up.  Basically when an (aspect?) effects a PC decision, and the player choose to accept that it does, they get a fate point.  The point you are making is that this generally introduces a complication for the PC, so they are taking on more trouble now, for more firepower to use later.  OK.<br/><br/><i>(warning, off topic:  Thats pretty cool - in my game I am doing a very similar thing (player gets reward points for having a character motivation described as a consideration during decision making), but Im doing it for different reasons.

First, FATE has a fractal, so you can represent <em>everything</em> as a character, not just the PC's. Then, you can offer compels not just on the PC's aspects, but on the aspects for, say, the scene. Second, you have to pay a fate point to refuse a compel, so depending on how many fate points you currently have, you may find yourself in no position to say no. Third, you can use compels to encourage players to act on their aspects, or to bring in complications because of their aspects. I often use it to push a player towards a goal.<br/><br/>I don't think this is a derail, because I think that it's a pretty good approach to implementing this kind of story arc. Admittedly, I tend not to like the kind of well-defined approach that David outlines. To me, the fate point economy seems much more organic, while still in keeping with that general pattern. It reinforces a satisfying dramatic arc, without <em>enforcing</em> it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_321152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321152/#Comment_321152" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-18T18:41:05+00:00" title="April 18, 2011  6:41PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 18, 2011 6:43PM by jenskot.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Agreed that its best that whatever system is used, it isn't predictable.

Each one is player-defined, and must have both positive and negative aspects. A few examples are given, like Competitive, Fever Genius, Gentleman, or Inquisitive. Batteries start off uncharged; you charge it by having it screw with your character's life, and discharge it for in-game benefits - you have to get yourself in trouble a little if you're going to show off later.</i>"<br/><br/>Yes, I would say the similar thing, although the duality thing is interesting.  My reading of that is that if you use your 'competitive' to complicate your life now, you get to be competitive in a way that helps you latter  1:1 correspondence, which is a bit limiting?  Maybe that's the wrong interpretation.<br/><br/>But in any rate, both for the batteries and the FATE thingy, introducing a complication does not necessarily mean <b>failure</b>, it just means more <b>struggle</b>.

That sort of thing.<br/><br/>I think if you are specifically rewarding <i>only </i>when they kick in, it might be throwing too much of a metagame spanner into something which is best decided due to in-game factors only.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_321172">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cy" title="cy"><img alt="cy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cy">cy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321172/#Comment_321172" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-18T20:54:54+00:00" title="April 18, 2011  8:54PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In FATE, the play can spend a Fate Point (instead of gaining one) to avoid having an aspect compelled.

The encouragement is more for selecting motivations at character time that have a chance of coming into play, and remembering they are there during play, than specifically meta-gaming a complication through their use.

Failure is 'failure to achieve goals' I suppose.  <br/><br/>What about suffering?  Often protagonists suffer a lot, which tends to make us root for them.  That also makes the highs higher.

You lose, you get a token. If you want to win pay one or more tokens, depending on the difficulty.

Partly, I think because you know what you need to do to win, and partly because in the movie, even though the plot is fixed (and you're pretty sure the good guys will win), it's what you expect from this medium (also there's so much going on that immersion can mean you don't worry too much about the plot). In games, you like to feel in control but at the same time not know what's going to happen. This is harder to do if you make the resolution as simple as the token system.<br/><br/>You can introduce a random element which makes it a bit more exciting. For every token, roll 1d6, subtract from your total if it's a loss, add if it's a win. The immediate roll gives the scale of the win in that scene and the overall total gives the progress of plot. On average you'll end up where you started, a negative final total is a bitter sweet victory, a positive total something better.

Big fights started looking really bad, with the characters getting beaten up and things looking hopeless.  Until they built up a pool of cards, got the initiative stars to align, and laid down some hurt.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I'm a little wary of in this discussion is the assumption that the "final scene" is really the most important and kind of pre-determined.  This might be true when there's a clear villain, but I'd say the lack of any sort of character agency in what the central conflict should be is what's making it unsatisfying.  The victory scene could be anything from killing the bad guys to ruling the world to getting the girl to being loved by your kids.  Which of them it is could be determined by how and when you failed leading up to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if it was as simple as you "lose" all conflicts (or maybe have to roll,) until you decide to stand up for one that's important, which you automatically win?  When you win, that's the end of your story, or at least this chapter in your story.  That emphasizes the choice, which is the central element in the drama here, IMHO.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_321252">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321252/#Comment_321252" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-19T15:05:30+00:00" title="April 19, 2011  3:05PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Nathan H.</cite>You wrote that drama comes from contrast, not conflict.</blockquote>\nWhat does that mean?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_321262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321262/#Comment_321262" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-19T16:52:28+00:00" title="April 19, 2011  4:52PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite><br>Also, in a movie, you can be pretty sure that the good guys will win in the end and can still believe that they are trying as hard as they can to win in their earlier conflicts, too.

It's not very much in keeping with the dramatic trope of the good guys losing important conflicts and suffering real consequences at the beginning of the play/movie/novel despite their best efforts, but managing to pull it all together at the end and win their ultimate battle.  Those stories tend to have the opposition either remaining stable (the Empire doesn't gain in power in any significant way over the course of the movie) or actually falling apart a little (the terrorists in Die Hard have lost men, and one of them is obsessed with revenge for his brother to the point of no longer being a reliable second-in-command).  Meanwhile, the heroes are bloodied and bruised from their past setbacks, but somehow manage to find hidden reserves of strength.<br/><br/>I guess it all comes down to what you're trying to emulate, and whether you made those earlier losses and their consequences count.  If you're not trying for genre emulation and a heroic story, then the characters might as well lose and keep losing while their enemies keep getting more powerful and harder to defeat, until at the very end they're fighting the hardest fight they possibly can, and maybe losing that one, too.  There's absolutely nothing wrong with that kind of game, it drove all kinds of D&amp;D modules back in the day.  It's challenging when the stakes and the forces against you keep escalating, and that's one of the things that a lot of people really love in a game.<br/><br/>Or if you're aiming to emulate a heroic story in that vein, but make the consequences of their early failures weak and/or easily-fixed, then there's no payoff for winning the (much easier) fight at the end: basically, the heroes get slapped around in a meaningless way early on, then stomp the crap out of their opponents at the end.  I guess that could be fun, too, but it's kind of missing the mark set in the first post: the characters are failing at the beginning, but they're not really <i>losing</i>: the contrast between those failures and their success won't be very much, and that last fight won't be satisfying at all.<br/><br/>But imagine a game where the opposition is really, genuinely, 100% tougher than the PCs at the beginning of the game, and <i>make that hurt</i>.  The PCs suffer huge setbacks, lose things that cannot be replaced, and have to deal with long-term consequences.  And it happens more than once, but slowly the balance starts to shift: the advantage that the opposition had over them diminishes, meanwhile they're acquiring new resources.  By the time that they can step in and force a showdown with their enemies, they're practically equals, or maybe even have a slight advantage.  That last fight isn't about "How will we win against these terrible odds?" but rather about getting the catharsis of finally, at long last, winning.  It <i>feels</i> like a hard-won victory, because everyone is still thinking about all the grief they had to go through just to get here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_321273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321273/#Comment_321273" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-19T19:17:47+00:00" title="April 19, 2011  7:17PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite><cite>Posted By: stefoid</cite>To generalize, dont you want the opposition to become firmer as the stakes get higher?</blockquote>\nDo you really want that, though? .<br/><br/>You want the stakes to be higher.

I've seen it done (most recently in a 7th Sea game, but the classic example would be: D&amp;D party gets mauled by dragon; retreats; comes back with a specific plan designed to trounce that specific dragon based on how it kicked their asses before), but I don't think it was planned in advance, and it wasn't explicitly supported by the system.  There was nothing in particular driving the game in the "heroes lose, learn a lesson, then come back and triumph" direction.<br/><br/>That's probably where I'd start if I was looking to set up a rule to encourage that, anyway.  Figure out what kinds of conflicts can teach lessons, how to aim conflicts to teach those lessons, and then think about how those lessons can contribute to a later victory.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_321287">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321287/#Comment_321287" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-19T21:04:44+00:00" title="April 19, 2011  9:04PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If its the type of game where you have 'traits', then when you get your arse handed to you, you get an extra trait that concerns the reason for your failure.

It's also an experience of a specific sort for the players at the table: I think it's more important that they experience the ups and downs then that the characters in the story do. Will the final climactic victory feel satisfying, will the defeats along the way hurt and build tension, if we all know that we're going to lose the first three conflicts but win the final showdown before we even start playing?<br/><br/>"Afraid" had this built-in in an interesting way: the opposition (the monster) stayed the same, while with each character's death, the players built up resources and created stronger characters. It becomes a question of how many deaths are necessary to stop the evil from taking place.<br/><br/>I generally find a lot of games in the "indie" model get around this issue of dramatic pacing by making everything uncertain: we don't know who the hero is, who the villain is, or how it will turn out until we play it through.<br/><br/>More "simulationistic" games can create a pre-designed story arc, however.

None of the games mentioned include that risk.</p>\nWell, some of the variations people are talking about do:<br/><br/>For instance, take a system like Spirit of the Century, but with slightly stronger/more heavy impact Fate points. Push this far enough and each story arc becomes predictable. It's not in that territory as written, but it's heading gently into that direction, know what I mean? <br/><br/>Imagine, for instance, if you were playing a d20 game and the "Fate points" you gained by losing conflicts gave +100 hit points when spent, with no drawback to use. Clearly ludicrous: it takes all the suspense out of what's about to happen next.<br/><br/>Somewhere along that continuum you'll hit your personal limit, where it starts to feel like railroading.<br/><br/>You're quite correct, though, that all the well-designed games we're talking about avoid this pitfall in different, and effective, ways.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_322084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322084/#Comment_322084" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-28T12:50:23+00:00" title="April 28, 2011 12:50PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm in agreement that "predictable" takes away from "drama".<br/><br/>But I don't think the use of railroad in this context is correct. Although I can understand why it happens.<br/><br/>Railroading is a pejorative term that describes a very specific form of dysfunctional gaming. In the larger RPG world, railroading is a style of gaming where there is one predetermined plot line and those involved are forced to follow it even if they don't want to. <br/><br/>A game mechanic that has a predictable effect that you choose to use is not a railroad. <br/><br/>I think what's happening is the emotion one feels when being railroaded may be similar to some of the emotions they feel when using a tool set with overly predictable results. That doesn't make it railroading. There may be overlapping feelings but that doesn't make it the same thing. <br/><br/>It's tempting to use terms like railroading because of the baggage / impact / attention they bring to a conversation. It happens in RPG conversations all the time. "That's a railroad" starts taking the place of "something I don't like." This often happens unintentionally and isn't malicious at all. But its use can distract from having a productive conversation. Instead, let's be specific.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_322347">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Troels%20Ken" title="Troels Ken"><img alt="Troels Ken" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Troels%20Ken">Troels Ken</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322347/#Comment_322347" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-30T01:32:01+00:00" title="April 30, 2011  1:32AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 30, 2011 1:34AM by Troels Ken.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As jdfristrom said, In a Wicked Age.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy very favourite version of it is the We Owe list in In a Wicked Age. That lets you attempt to seek late advantage from increasing your risk early. The way it works is, if you survive the first round of a conflict against greater dice than yours (usually because you choose your approach in a conflict to utilise forms that aren't your greatest strengths), you go on the list. You can cross off yourself to reappear in a later session, or to gain an advantage die (which is pretty powerful).<br/>\n<br/>\nThis way, it's an option not mandatory, it's under player control, it's a way to tweak the odds but there's no certainty, either of actually getting on the list or of winning with your advantage die.

I'm in total agreement!<br/><br/>However, there is another side to that whole issue, and that is how players react to the game. I feel that the more predictable a game's outcome, the easier or more likely it is for the players to go into a scene (or entire game!) with a pre-conceived outcome. When you do that, the whole game suffers: you're no longer open to other possibilities.<br/><br/>When it's openly communicated, and everyone's on the same page, it can be quite functional, I'm sure.<br/><br/>But when it's not entirely in the open, it can cause dysfunction at the gaming table.<br/><br/>Not just GMs do this: I once had a player in a pretty "trad" game who came to the table with a desired ending point for his character. He hoped to confront his character's son and then do something else (I don't know the details: he never told me, or any of the other players what he was planning).<br/><br/>It made the game much more difficult because he wouldn't engage with anything in play that didn't seem to be heading in that direction. It's not that he wasn't interested: he was just really looking forward to this moment he'd imagined (but not communicated to us), so he wouldn't want to focus on scenes or characters or issues that weren't taking the story in that direction. Once I realized what was going on and we talked, he was perfectly happy to engage with the very same elements he'd previously ignored: he was interested in them, but was just trying to postpone dealing with them because he had this whole story arc planned out. <br/><br/>It's like when a GM blocks interesting developments from the players because she's anxious to get to her next planned scene, already. If you told her, "Hey, wouldn't it actually be interesting if we did see what would happen if the party requested an audience with the Goblin King?", she might respond, "Oh, yeah, that would be cool, I suppose! Let's try it." It just didn't cross her mind before, as she was so focused on this other planned thing.<br/><br/>I would imagine that a game like D&amp;D 4E (which I haven't played, so I could be totally wrong) might encourage this kind of thought process:<br/><br/>"The encounters are balanced so that the PCs [almost?] always win. So, I'm planning this fight. <i>When they succeed</i>, we'll move on to scene G4."<br/><br/>I know this doesn't have to be dysfunctional, it can be workable and fun too. But I think certain rules can make it easier to slip in that direction without even realizing it.<br/><br/>For example, given a system which gives players more and more "bennies/bonuses" as they go along, and a scenario about some big villain, it's quite natural to start considering, "What will happen once the heroes have defeated the villain?" This is just as true for players as for GMs. But I think that when you come to the table interested in some plan which will take effect once the villain is defeated, you could be ignoring or shutting down other possible directions for play, and, worse yet, you might be bored with the actual drama of the struggle with the villain. Because you feel like you can already look ahead to something else.<br/><br/>I don't know if this makes sense. But I'm fairly convinced that some kind of phenomenon along these lines exists. That's what I was trying to say earlier.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_322384">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322384/#Comment_322384" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-30T10:31:39+00:00" title="April 30, 2011 10:31AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That definitely happens.<br/><br/>I see it in D&amp;D 4E all the time. Because of the expectation of balanced encounters, players get upset if an encounter is too easy or too hard. <br/><br/>I think this is all about setting and managing expectations. <br/><br/>And it applies to almost any game mechanic. But especially for mechanics that deal with the overall direction of a game. <br/><br/>In the Castle Ravenloft board game, your character sheet has a Level 1 side and a Level 2 side. So most players expect to level up. But you can only level up if you roll a natural 20 AND you have 5XP to spend. Most people don't level up in an average game and it is very rare for everyone to level up.  So after playing, many people are disappointed. <br/><br/>Also, not every game is for every person. I know people that can't help but "pre play" even when a mechanic doesn't encourage it. They have expectations of how a game should go and get upset when the mechanics contradict those expectations. So they don't play certain games.
