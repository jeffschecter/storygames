I sometimes feel like discussing roleplaying online always leans towards the crazy awesome or the terrible, with little acknowledgment of what normally happens when folks come to the table.  So this is a thread for brief shout-outs to normal, solid play.<br/><br/>For example, today was my final session with StoryGames Boston (since I'm moving to Seattle) and the second session of a 2-shot of The Mountain Witch.  The first session was okay, but this session was really solid.  Only two characters survived.  There were some cool visual effects where different parts of the ghost city were only visible in flashes when clouds passed overhead.  Chuck's character became the new mountain witch at the end, a very fitting ending.  After that we played a one-lap race of Formula De with six racers and only three finished without crashing into the stands.  Then we went for beers and food at one of our favorite local hangouts down the street.  All in all, a great celebration of what SGBoston has been in the three years since we put it together in 2006.  Yay!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_218635">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218635/#Comment_218635" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-15T22:50:36+00:00" title="July 15, 2009 10:50PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Jonathan! Welcome to Seattle!<br/><br/>Here's what I played at Go Play NW and don't have time to write an AP for. I'm sorry there are so many exclamation points:<br/><br/>Wilhelm ran some OD&amp;D (Swords &amp; Wizardry). We fought goblins! We made a map! I found treasure in an acid pool using a 10 foot pole and four large sacks!<br/><br/>I ran Principia for seven people and it worked! Invisible Lucrezia Borgia stabbed Ludovico and Caterina Sforza in the back. Then Caterina rose from the dead because she'd previously been bitten by vampire Machiavelli! Florence wasn't destroyed, but a new Inquisition was launched.<br/><br/>We played Microscope. None of us could remember the story of the Lost City of Kandor, so we made one up. Political intrigue and scientific hubris destroyed Krypton. Later, Earth was sucked into a black hole. There was no Superman. Microscope is a new kind of game, and it deserves all your love.<br/><br/>Ogre ran a game where we were the entourage for a 1999 Christian Rock Band called Millennium Crater. I got to see a whole bunch of the Story Gamers strut their Story Gamer stuff, and loved every minute of it.<br/><br/>I ran Car Wars for some old-school grognards (and Sage). It was good. Sage wrecked, I think three of his own cars, and who knows how many others.<br/><br/>Anima Prime is a tight, tight game. Anime Hells Angels attacked our train and we burned them with fire. Then we did a super combo team move on the Emperor! The game has been playtested a lot, and it shows. <br/><br/>I got to run Principia again! Michelangelo, Lucerzia Borgia, and Machiavelli decided to use Leonardo's flying machine to get over the walls and negotiate with / assassinate Ludovico Sforza.<br/><br/>We played Committee for the Exploration of Dungeons with Eric Boyd. It was fun to watch a bombastic wizard, a dodgy Dwarf and an untrusty burglar trade barbs and brags at the Inn.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_218637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218637/#Comment_218637" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-16T00:11:46+00:00" title="July 16, 2009 12:11AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, here's some Normal Awesome Tweets from Go Play NW:<br/><br/>I played a Dwarf in Swords and Wizardry. I got props for employing a Manchester accent rather than the typical Scottish. There was a short joke or two, and a "girth over length!" rejoinder from me. I got my hand chomped to wedge an iron spike in a chomping alligator statue. I lost one hitpoint! We bartered with the frog people, and Matthew S-b's Elven Sorceress (she's adventuring to put herself through magic college) cast Sleep on the halfling robbers. We hightailed it with a load of treasure, and I never had to swing my axe once!<br/><br/>I played a game of Capes in which I was Joe Rage, sweet-tempered and compassionate blue-collar supervillain. OK not really! He collapsed the corporate HQ of the People Who Made Him This Way. He received a brain-boost from conniving commie villain Doctor Steel (played by Alan Barclay), and rose from the rubble a vengeful and erudite Marxist!<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_218651">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218651/#Comment_218651" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-16T04:41:43+00:00" title="July 16, 2009  4:41AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At GPNW:  St\xe1s, who spent the entire game with an ammo-less pistol, gets frog-marched to Szucha Alley by the Gestapo ... with a pocket full of ammo and no pistol.<br/><br/>This past Monday:  While the rest of my patrol held it down, my guy poked a raven's eye out screaming "You don't fuck with the Mouse Guard!"<br/><br/>Last night:  My guy finally took his slave shackles off after helping to kill the Governor of the province that had enslaved him so long ago - a personal vow - with the help of his heroic friends.

I usually play competent characters and "straight men."  I'm delighted when they face difficult situations and choices, and even if things go horribly wrong for them.  But I'm usually framing scenes or encouraging others to frame scenes to that end, not having my character's choices lead directly to mishap.<br/><br/>Recent Burning Wheel:  We've only had one short session.  I hope to do a lengthier post later about some of the scenes and charcters.  For now I'll say I'm really excited about the potential of the situation we've created.  It's 886 AD Eire in Tirath, a viking-ruled village.  We've got both Norse and Irish who are Christians or pagans, rebellious and acquiescent factions, and with wild trouble-filled connections, familial and otherwise, between all the characters.  It's a powder keg on one level, but the connections mean it will likely go off in slow-motion and with great pathos.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_218828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218828/#Comment_218828" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-16T14:57:56+00:00" title="July 16, 2009  2:57PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In last night's Danger Patrol game, after Shannon's Two-Fisted Explorer wrestled and tamed a Crystal Dragon from the rings of Saturn, Scott's Atomic Flyboy was accidentally teleported to the 5th dimension and became possessed by an energy demon.<br/><br/>So that was pretty cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_218830">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218830/#Comment_218830" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-16T15:08:53+00:00" title="July 16, 2009  3:08PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The simple pleasure of sharing a meal and then gaming on the porch in the midst of an upstate New York summer evening.<br/><br/>Very nice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_218846">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218846/#Comment_218846" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-16T16:08:53+00:00" title="July 16, 2009  4:08PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matthew--you beat me to it!<br/><br/>But i'll also comment on the Burning Ireland game: What's great is, as Matt says,the great entangled conflict-entangled mess of it all. We just scratched the surface in the session, but it was really nice to kind of take a stroll with the fiction, establishing and fleshing out our characters, getting a feel for how they relate to others, and rolling about one Test each, test driving the System and how it affects the fiction. Very rewarding, with keen anticipation for the next session.<br/><br/>I especially had fun trying on the Irish idiom, stuff like the famed sarcastic understatement, like this line my angry young man Gabhran spat out when he returned home from fighting Vikings tlo find Vikings ruling the town: "Sure, Father, this was not quite the welcome I expected!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_218857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218857/#Comment_218857" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-16T16:56:19+00:00" title="July 16, 2009  4:56PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my Sorcerer &amp; Sword game, one player built a coffin, dug a crave, carved a headstone, made a flower wreath, and then used the whole thing as a Contain for her Great-Grandmother Lich.

Another guy refused to commit rape, lost some dice and died trying to kill Salladin, who had murdered his family. My guy went from having the goal "Reclaim Spain for the Spaniards" to killing all of his friends (including another PC) and swearing loyalty to Salladin. It was very intense.<br/><br/>Then on sunday, I played with some trad gamers my game in development Utpost. One of them betrayed the outpost, another trusted her and regretted it. When she apologised to the nazi-like kommendant he shot her dead, thereby condemning the outpost to a certain doom (had he forgiven her, they'd probably have made it, because of the way the system works).<br/><br/>Tuesday, I played Utpost again with more trad gamers. The security chief thought he had killed the janitor (he hadn't) and went almost mad with guilt. The doctor did bizarre experiments and created a psycho supersoldier that nealy killed the entire outpost. Also, giant space monster that tore a bunch of redshirts to pieces.

Our characters bounced off each other and had a good amount of tension while fighting off a horde of assassins (which our research PC told us always worked alone, thanks to a botched roll, leading to some good lines).  There were kidnappings and firefights around our spaceship and other goodnesses.
