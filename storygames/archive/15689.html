So they don't have to look boring. <a href="http://qrcode.kaywa.com/" rel="nofollow">Generating QR Codes</a> is very easy.<br/><br/>The URL you scan can have variables attached to it. So when I scan your button, it might link me to:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.yourAwesomeLARP.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.yourAwesomeLARP.com</a>?<b>armor=5</b><br/><br/>Then simply have the website grab the variable, run it through your game's system, and tell me what to do next. It could even ask you questions before giving you the final result. I scan the button, it asks me how tired / insane / hurt / powered up I am, and then it tells me what awful or amazing thing happens to me. It could even play an audio file, a video, or have your phone call the GM, an NPC, another player, or a monster! Coding this isn't too difficult. <a href="http://www.codecademy.com" rel="nofollow">You can learn to code right now</a>!<br/><br/>You can even create your own virtual worlds by using custom Google Maps! Playing in a park, city, or camp ground? Look up the location on Google Maps and fill it with virtual markers representing all fictional places to see in your game. <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/04/map-making-so-easy-caveman-could-do-it.html" rel="nofollow">Here's how.</a><br/><br/><br/><br/>Who wants my money?<br/><br/>The game itself should probably be good as well :-P                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355826/#Comment_355826" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-24T17:49:22+00:00" title="January 24, 2012  5:49PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I've augmented my larps with QR codes and it is awesome.

Ideally, you wouldn't have those bits anyway, but if you do, why not let a computer handle it?  Write a bit of Javascript that track encumbrance or handles the grappling rules for you.  Then, when you encounter that rule, you just swipe the code and the phone takes care of the fiddly bits.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite><br/>Imagine a slightly larger sheet, with significant parts of the sheet (that is, significantly important or perhaps hard to grasp) having QR codes next to them.

You read over the rules in the book and still don't get it? Scan the code and get a wealth of additional data on how it works.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
