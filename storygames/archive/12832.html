It was interesting and at points not the game I expected. I think Shael made it that way though.<br/><br/>Kelly Perkins was a social engineer who came to Mars with a resume of six great cities predicted to fail whose infrastructure he redesigned and returned to functionality.<br/><br/>The problems the colony faced were a general lack of healthcare for the populace that was causing massive discontent, acts of terrorism that could be directly tied to a minority party that was inciting its base with violent rhetoric, and malfunctioning gravity normalizers that were causing the domes of the colony to fluctuate between Earth gravity and Mars gravity which caused major crises.<br/><br/>So, key scenes:<br/><br/>- Kelly Perkins hiring a hitman to kill Councilmember Stuart, who was one of the people to stand up against Kelly Perkins's universal healthcare plan. He was actually one of the key individuals indirectly fostering anti-government terrorism. After his death, terrorist attacts subsided and there were rumors that he was supporting them more directly.<br/><br/>- After initially passing a limp compromise bill that was never really intended to kick in, a gravity normalizer malfunction causes mass injuries in one of the domes revealing that healthcare is still a problem. The gravity normalizer malfunction, by the way, was caused by a new experimental wire created by a graduate physics student that was supposed to correct the problems in the old normalizers. The public blames Perkins.<br/><br/>- Kelly Perkins invites Councilmember Roberts to a private dinner, ambushes him wearing a ski mask, and pistol-whips him while shouting, "FIND A DOCTOR, ROBERTS. FIND A DOCTOR. WHAT? OH YOU CAN'T FIND ONE BECAUSE THERE AREN'T ANY." The next day, Roberts announces his support for an improved healthcare bill which pushes through.<br/><br/>This probably sounds more gonzo than it actually was. There were a lot of speeches, interviews, gladhanding, and failure due to bureaucratic roadblocks, political obstruction, lack of funding, and a news media eager to speculate on everything Perkins did. But all that stuff was fun to play but probably boring to read about.<br/><br/>Perkins actually helped things out. Mars was still a mess when he left it. Terrorist attacks restarted shortly after he left, two of the domes had been converted into agricultural centers after their gravity cores failed which led to greater self-sufficiency but overcrowding in the remaining sectors, and while everyone had free access to healthcare the colony lacked the infrastructure so there were long waits, rationing, and all those things people warn about.<br/><br/>Afterwards, Shael said, "I feel like this isn't a game of solving problems, it's a game of taking credit for the problems going away on their own." Perkins' policies (and violent felonies) did seem to correlate to an improvement in conditions on Mars, but it was a total crapshoot on whether they worked or not.<br/><br/>Shael was a lot of fun to play with, by the way. His angst when one of his plans failed was intense.<br/><br/>Afterwards on our way to eat sushi we talked about how Kelly Perkins can really enact some ridiculous plans and have them succeed based on die rolls. We want to to try Libertarian Kelly Perkins whose solution to everything is to cut taxes and reduce government spending, and we want to try Commando Kelly Perkins and have him dropped off on Mars with a machine gun and unlimited ammunition.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288890/#Comment_288890" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-25T20:14:15+00:00" title="August 25, 2010  8:14PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bret Gillan</cite>- Kelly Perkins hiring a hitman to kill Councilmember Stuart</blockquote>\nOh, SNAP!\n<blockquote>Afterwards on our way to eat sushi we talked about how Kelly Perkins can really enact some ridiculous plans and have them succeed based on die rolls.

I've read through Mars Colony a couple of times, and I'm still pretty psyched to play it, but it does seem like you can totally play it in the way you're describing up there. Play Kelly Perkins as a progressive, a fascist, an anarchist, a Nazi, as Batman or Blackadder or Barney Fife, as a genocidal "all non-Earthers must die" fanatic, or as someone whose solution to every problem, every time, is to throw a tea party and give everyone free cupcakes - all of these alternate situations will play out with exactly the same level of success or failure, given the same rolls. Am I reading that right?<br/><br/>(I am totally not saying that this is a bad thing, by the way!)<br/><br/>I ask primarily because of the discussion a short while back about "parlor narration". I remember reading through the new Mars Colony book on the way back from GenCon, and thinking to myself, "oh, yeah, this is a great example of a totally sweet game that is basically this wind-up toy design that people have been talking about..." And then I went to look up <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=12494" rel="nofollow">the thread</a>, and saw that it was basically started by a comment that Tim made; in the discussion, Mars Colony is held up as an example of "not that", and I got all confused again. I'm still pretty confused, I think, but calling it one thing or another doesn't really matter to me, as long as it's enjoyable to play, and it really seems like it is!<br/><br/>So, when I get the chance, I'll sit down and re-read the rules again with this in mind. If it turns out that you can just plow through a game, not narrating at all and just rolling the dice to see what happens and who was supposed to say what, totally fine by me. If play is identical whether you play Kelly as a shadowy assassin picking off troublemakers or a super-cute anthropomorphised koala bear who solves problems by stoically chewing on leaves until people forget their troubles, all the better.

I haven't played yet, but the Fear cards seem to be most effective as an aligning agent; that is, thinking of them and writing them aligns you toward the type of play that the game works best with.

It sounds like a great story (even with the gonzo "tangent" that made me go WTF).  I think catharsis is a very common element in Mars Colony games.  Shael's tendency to make Kelly violent is not all that surprising.<br/><br/>I think the thrust of this thread seems to be about the extent to which the game allows you to use any sort of plan you want with similar mechanical effect.  The short answer is yes, if you want to "pray to the banana," you can.  The game doesn't judge you for that.  I think Bret and Hans have it right, though.  There is a certain trust placed in the players to make a coherent story.<br/><br/>Bret, as you said (and this made me very happy), "The game makes no political judgments."  In order to accomplish that as a design goal, I could in no way favor one tactic over another mechanically.  And I think it works well.  I've only ever played in one slightly silly game of MC -- but even then the silliness was restrained by both of us.  If things got out of hand, we could always say, "No."  That's the beauty of the two-player form.  It's intimate and very easy to regulate the tone.<br/><br/>Marc, let's leave the wind-up toy design thread aside for now.  I'm not surprised that you're confused about that thread.  I didn't really succeed in conveying what I really intended to convey there, and I fear it's only going to confuse things now.  The take-home point is that my intention for Mars Colony was to leave things open-ended so that the players could map their own political frustrations onto the fiction.  Mechanically, the game is supposed to illicit reactions to failure.  Success is almost beside the point.<br/><br/>Finally, I'm really excited to hear everyone talking about the different Kelly Perkins personalities they'd like to try out.  I truly did intend MC to be re-playable.  Thus far I've seen Kellys ranging from totalitarian all the way to hippie.  I've played Kellys that favored everything from gentle persuasion to military action.  It's all been great fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289119">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289119/#Comment_289119" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-27T06:59:39+00:00" title="August 27, 2010  6:59AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I definitely see the lack of political judgments as a feature. I can play it with friends who are socialist, conservative, libertarian, and not have it fail any of them and I think it will let us create a work of fiction that lets us discuss our various politics.<br/><br/>I may have underlined the more out-there elements of this game a little too much. Overall Kelly was a very down-to-earth politician, but when we sort of worked out Mars Colony politics to be more like an isolated frontier city, Shael had Kelly react to failure in an extreme way. Think of Mars Colony as Deadwood-like and I think Shael's actions don't seem too gonzo. Also I think Shael was venting his own frustrations at the frequency of failure. But we both enjoyed it!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289126">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch" title="Will_Hindmarch"><img alt="Will_Hindmarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.wordstudio.net/coffee_ring-32px.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch">Will_Hindmarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289126/#Comment_289126" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-27T07:28:29+00:00" title="August 27, 2010  7:28AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (I am deeply curious about this game and enthusiastic to see more AP and analysis of it, so I just wanted to say I love this thread.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289145">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marc_Majcher" title="Marc_Majcher"><img alt="Marc_Majcher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marc_Majcher">Marc_Majcher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289145/#Comment_289145" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-27T09:11:58+00:00" title="August 27, 2010  9:11AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tim C Koppang</cite>The take-home point is that my intention for Mars Colony was to leave things open-ended so that the players could map their own political frustrations onto the fiction.

Success is almost beside the point.</blockquote>\nYeah, that's a very cool and interesting way to think about it - I totally got the "you're probably going to fail a lot, how are you going to deal with it?" vibe from the game, and that's partly what grabs me about it. And yeah, I totally love that the players bring their own issues to the table, and since there's only the two, it's relatively easy to stay on tone. <br/><br/>So, sweet. The thing about the fiction not necessarily feeding back into the mechanical side of things isn't super important here - although, if you want to talk about it some more in another thread, I'd still be interested in laying some stuff out around that. For now, though, I'll wait until I've actually played it some before yammering about theoreticals.

The rougher edges have been chopped off and the remaining parts have been streamlined. I love it.<br/><br/>Every time I've played Mars Colony there has always been a point when a one has come up on a roll. And it always comes up at the "wrong" time. (The clever thing is that you roll enough for it to happen, and any time it does happen it's the wrong time by definition, because every f'king roll is critical.) And you're faced with failure. In your face. Nothing you can do about it. Well, except Lie your way through it and keep the score but open yoursefl up for more punches down the path. It's a big question about whether you do it or not. And while it's your "character's" choice, it's also your choice as a player too (even if you don't realise it).<br/><br/>Tim's game puts you in a position of confronting your failure and it's subtly coloured by your own fears of government (and yourself, but, shhh don't tell anyone). In the notes Tim lays himself absolutely bare on the page. It's powerful stuff and something almost every games designer shies away from admitting they do in their games.<br/><br/>I like to play it soberly because by playing it gonzo I'm kind of deluding myself. I mean I'm pretending this is how I'd really react to failure, and it's not really me doing this. (But it is. And that's frightening.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289265">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289265/#Comment_289265" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-27T17:05:52+00:00" title="August 27, 2010  5:05PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, there are a lot of pressures to Deceive.

Even more interesting is finding out when, if ever, the idealistic Kelly will break her word.  That said, I've only seen one player really try the idealistic strategy.
