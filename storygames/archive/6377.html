Doing so can really be challenging and can shut things down but I feel it's a REALLY important skill to develop.<br/><br/>As such I will be giving each player a crib sheet on how to develop a scene and I just kinda hope they can all spin off these ideas.  The idea is "follow the formula to a good game."  It may not be perfect but I think it's going to do the trick.<br/><br/>Can you look over this list and help me tweak it?  What should I add?  What should I reorder.  <br/><br/>*****************************<br/>Creating a scene in Burning Wheel<br/><br/>Belief v Belief<br/>Pick two or three other characters to have a scene with.<br/>What belief will you be persuing and how is it challenging another character's beliefs<br/>The other character's player then says how what they want is challenging your beliefs<br/><br/>Instincts<br/>Make the scene hit upon one instinct per person involved in the scene.<br/>Let the other characters decide if the instinct helps or hinders them in the conflict and how. <br/><br/>Traits<br/>Each player gets to claim a trait that is being brought into the scene.<br/><br/>Skills<br/>The main player and his adversary for the scene decides what skill they want to test against and can bring in one other skill and one wise.<br/>Any other character's may help with one other appropriate skill.<br/><br/>Location<br/>The GM sets up how the character's interact and places them in a location.<br/>Each player may use skill to add one element to the location that will either gain them an advantage die or an obstacle.<br/><br/>Play it out<br/>Dice in hand, once the GM has set the scene then the character's play through their situation and roll.

My thought is that this is the GM's job. <br/>\n<br/>\nDon't get me wrong. I'm all for players playing a part in setting up scenes, etc. If and when they feel like it. But I also feel that it should be completely optional and that if they don't want to create any scenes, that the GM should be there to do it. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, if the GM knows the BITs here, he should have put some small amount of prep into things. Coming up with a situation that, in fact, makes it easy to come up with the scenes in question, by entangling the BITs in them. It's not the scenes that are the difficult part, here, but the situation itself. <br/>\n<br/>\nDo you have that part? The "scenario" and what it entails in terms of elements you believe will lead to conflict? Take Luke's "The Gift" scenario... that would be a pretty hard situation to come up with off the top of your head. It takes time and thought. Once you have the situation, creating scenes is easy. But that's because the situation screams out with possibilities. <br/>\n<br/>\nI play with no prep a lot. Two observations:<br/>\n1) These games aren't as good as the games with prep. <br/>\n2) I still have to do most of the heavy lifting as GM to come up with the situation, or the game goes nowhere. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, playing like this a lot, I'm getting pretty good at "instant situation" creation. But it's a skill that's taken me decades of play to develop. And even if I can do it, I'm not sure that's what I'd like from playing with a GM. Call me a hapless traditional, but I like the interplay between GM and player in creating ongoing situation. <br/>\n<br/>\nNo, that doesn't mean you have to prepare the scenes... personally I find that anathema to me now. But that's not the same as saying that it doesn't behoove me to have some situation set up that has a propensity to develop when in contact with the PCs. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow... if you wanted to write up a situation definition checklist or somthing... that might be interesting. But I'm not convinced that players are all that interested in creating their own situation, even if enabled. Similar to the Czege Principle. <br/>\n<br/>\nNote that some systems cause situation to accrete to the play of the game, based on previous play. So that play leads to situation that leads to play. That's optimal. But BW is not one of those games (nor are there any that do this with anything like great fecundity). <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141097">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141097/#Comment_141097" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-24T10:21:26+00:00" title="April 24, 2008 10:21AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don,<br/><br/>Funny that you should write this because it just came up in a BW game I ran over skype.<br/><br/>Also important, very important, are the NPC's reactions to the players' actions.  Last week I got my head down and stopped paying attention to Beliefs as much as just playing NPC's reactions to the PC's actions and it led to a slow session.  I didn't hammer on their Beliefs and honestly, they didn't pursue them with any kind of real conviction either.  We all got our heads wrapped into the bits and pieces of the going's on in the game.<br/><br/>For creating a scene in Burning Wheel, I generally hammer on one thing.  I make my life simple.  I hammer on a Belief or an Instinct or a Trait if I'm aggressively scene framing.  Odds are, if the BIT's were crafted well, hitting one will set off others.  Players will make connections and launch their characters into action based either on the scene or the PC's reaction to the scenes creating a domino effect.<br/><br/>Your list above leaves me a bit cold.  I don't want to be a player and thinking explicitly about it all that much.  I want to be burning for a scene in a passionate way, not in a scientific *must push Belief button of Player X* way.  I want to be pointing at another player or glaring or laughing or spitting, "MOTHERFUCKER!  I want a scene NOW.  This shit ends/begins/changes right this moment."<br/><br/>The techniques above work but if the Beliefs and Instincts are crafted well enough in a pre-made scenario, they should be hitting each other's Beliefs and Instincts just from pursuing their own.  That is what players should be concentrating on, pursuing their Beliefs hard.<br/><br/>Judd<br/><br/>P.S.  I've made a few posts in a few different places today and they've all been kind of contrary, so maybe it is just me and I'm way off here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141104/#Comment_141104" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-24T10:39:19+00:00" title="April 24, 2008 10:39AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another aspect of Beliefs that your list does not mention and players (maybe not in con games but in general) should have their eyes open for is the creation of new Beliefs.<br/><br/>I've introduced NPC's and had players on the spot declare that their PC is in love with them or in hate with them or whatever and start crafting a Belief on the spot while ditching one that was getting medium-rare play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141116">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141116/#Comment_141116" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-24T11:23:36+00:00" title="April 24, 2008 11:23AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Thoughts?

You want to come to the table with a strong situation that hammers on (i.e., is supported by) the BITs of the PCs. Asking players, especially ones new to BW, to grok BW as well as scene framing is asking a lot.<br/><br/>See if the "Fire Over Omac" scenario for BE is on the BW/BE wiki. I used the relationship map template from BE to draw out all of the characters involved in that scenario, and the resulting map was insanely tightly woven. Every belief among the PCs/NPCs points to the other PCs/NPCs. The situation can't help but explode.<br/><br/>Actually, I have a pic of the map I made: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gameday/276559827/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.flickr.com/photos/gameday/276559827/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141249">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141249/#Comment_141249" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-25T07:17:43+00:00" title="April 25, 2008  7:17AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 25, 2008 7:19AM by Mel_White.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don,<br/>I like the idea of some sort of scene-framing \u2018template\u2019 even if it becomes more of a checklist.  It\u2019s possible that the template already exists along the lines of the scene framing requirements in Primetime Adventures.  Player determines location, plot vs character development, and agenda.  From this foundation, adding guidance based on specific BW (and let me add Burning Empires) features makes sense.  In BW/BE, certainly a character development scene would be focused on one of the PC\u2019s beliefs.  You could probably make the argument, too, that there shouldn\u2019t be any player \u2018plot\u2019 scenes in BW/BE\u2014all player-created scenes focus on developing a belief.  And even GM staged scenes should challenge one or more beliefs.  <br/>I\u2019d avoid having the players build scenes around anything other than character beliefs.  Beliefs are why characters do what they do.  In identifying the agenda for the scene, though, the player could identify the particular skill, trait, or instinct that he or she wants to highlight. <br/><br/>So, for BW/BE the template is location, belief development, and agenda.  I see it working something like this:  <br/>PLAYER:  \u201cI go to the throne room of the Witch King because I believe that he is my father and I will redeem his soul\u2014one way or the other.  I will engage him with words to start, and with steel--since I have been practicing the sword\u2014if necessary.\u201d   <br/>The GM then decides if the next scene is in the throne room or if it\u2019s somewhere along the journey.  A middle option could be GM determination of the need for a skill roll in order to determine the PC\u2019s status at the start of the scene.  For example:<br/>GM:  \u201cThe Witch King has many spies and defenses.  You will need to defeat them or avoid them to reach the throne unscathed.\u201d<br/>Player:  \u201cI fight them!\u201d<br/>GM:  \u201cOf course.   Test your sword skill against a particularly vigilant guard troll\u2019s brawling.  If you fail, you arrive at the Throne Room with a medium wound.\u201d<br/>Player: \u201cHow about we use Fight! instead, and that will be my scene?\u201d<br/>GM:  \u201cOK\u201d<br/> <br/>Other players could introduce their characters into the scene based on simple logistics (\u2018we were traveling together\u2019); traits (\u2018I\u2019m Curious--while sneaking into the troll\u2019s shack I was captured\u2019); or instincts (My instinct, \u2018watch out for my brother\u2019 means I will shadow him on his journey\u2019).  I think players should have to determine if they\u2019re in the scene or not immediately after the active player frames it, so that the joining players are subject to the same risks.  You could make the case, though, that joining the scene later is possible and more dramatic, too.  Like the cavalry riding to the rescue\u2026      <br/><br/>I recommend eliminating steps that ask a player to determine how his or her character\u2019s actions are challenging the beliefs of another PC.  There are a lot of reasons for this.  Two that come to mind are 1) players should only need to play their own character; it\u2019s up to the other players to determine if their beliefs are challenged.  And 2), in the best BW convention games I\u2019ve played (the Inheritance), the players did not know the other PCs\u2019 beliefs.  If the game is going to focus on inter-player character conflict the beliefs probably shouldn\u2019t be known.      <br/>In more typical BW games and BE, the players usually do know all the PCs\u2019 beliefs, but it just feels wrong for players to be specifically identifying another PC\u2019s belief to challenge.     <br/>Mel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141335">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141335/#Comment_141335" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-25T16:01:43+00:00" title="April 25, 2008  4:01PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for all of you're input.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141339/#Comment_141339" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-25T19:22:05+00:00" title="April 25, 2008  7:22PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, I think your crib sheet idea is a good one, Eruditus.
