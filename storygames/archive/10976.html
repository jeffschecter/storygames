A lot of times, I think up little uses for them, but don't really have a game I feel like building around them.<br/><br/>Here's one of those ideas:<br/><br/>Secrets and trouble causing cards-<br/><br/>Preliminary game situation<br/>Y'all have gotten together at the invitation of some initiating player to play Game X. We'll call that player the GM for now, because they probably are gonna take up that game role.<br/><br/>Anyway, the GM has sketched out the basic game situation: Genre, system being used, and outlines ( broadly) of the setting. They may not have gone too in-depth into anything they're thinking adventure-wise, but enough for the players to start thinking about characters.<br/><br/>Now, I'm gona also suggets that you're playing with a relatively communicative group. Players aren't going to go entirely off, make their own personal character in isolation, then come back and expect to play. There's a bit more back-and-forth than all that.<br/><br/>Let's say that the same holds true duriing game-play as well.<br/><br/>So, okay, what're the cards for?<br/><br/>Well each player is going to make up something really brief about their character, and they're going to crunch it down to a pretty brief description that is easy for everyone else at the table to hook into. Think: Character name plus 3-5 word description<br/><br/>Okay, fine and good, but I'm also going to guess that the players also have a few more bits about the character they'd like to get into the game. OTOH, they might be a bit fuzzy about those things themselves, and we also want to avoid too much character info-dumping.<br/><br/>So instead, the players each write down a number of things thaat somehow relate to their character that they also want to see come into play somehow. These are kinda like flags, right?<br/><br/>Each one is really brief, around a single sentence, and kinda open ended. The player should write their character name on the top of each index card, and also on the backside of it. I guess they could repeat info if they wanted to, but it's probably better if they don't.<br/><br/>They'll make a number of cards up equal to the number of other participants ( including the GM). They don't show what's on the "flag" sentence side.<br/><br/>When everyone has enough, the players go around in turn, handing out one card to another player. They'll have to give each other player one of the cards, but not more than one to any specific player.<br/><br/>What's the GM doing? Well, the GM is doing something similar, but related to setting/NPC/situation stuff.<br/><br/>What's all this do?<br/>Well basically, these cards are meant to give every other playeer a little bit of insight into both your character and what you'd like to see in the game being played. It's your job during the game to try to steer the story a little bit towards some of the stuff on those cards. How exactly is up to you and limited to some extent by what sort of authority participants in the game have in their game-roles.<br/><br/>And really, that's pretty much it. Not really sure what else to do with this as it's an orphaned mechanic. Any suggestions about how to use this stuff, or how to fit it into on-going play appreciated.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
