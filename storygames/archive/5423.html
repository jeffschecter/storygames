The fact that RBH "maps" can be nothing more than a quick scribble is a huge feature of the game as I see it. I'm more curious how people set up their arenas and how it made the game fun. This is, like, more of a "advice to GMs" thing.<br/><br/>For instance, if you had a fight in a huge Hall, would you break it up into several Arenas, like "By the Throne" and "on the Carpet in the middle" and "Under the Pillars"?<br/><br/>(Incidentally, this makes me think it could be neat to design a system where the players designate the arenas, creating the map collaboratively whenever a combat starts. Kind of like how that one player climbed up a tree and named it as an arena.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121697">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121697/#Comment_121697" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-24T10:56:55+00:00" title="January 24, 2008 10:56AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Paul,</p>\n<p>RBH doesn't tell you who gets to design the arenas.

Add to this the ability to alter the terrain - the creature in the great hall destroying the pillars with it's tail - area becoming more open and hazardous as ceiling starts giving way. Or more simply - the creature bats aside the market stalls leaving the town square more open so it can move more freely.<br/><br/>my GM advice is to use a variety of arenas (break up the hall into smaller arenas if you want) but if possible, allow for dynamic terrain - e.g  the rope bridge starting to fray, that bit in Fellowship of the Ring in the Mines when they get the broken stone bridge to sway.<br/><br/>players will want to use their favoured arenas for combat - but will enjoy it more if they have to adapt their tactics or the terrain itself to get an advantage over their foes - it's more of an achievement. It may lead to use of different talents - my naga's 3rd eye talent became her ace in the hole when the enemy was hiding behind a wall by an arch, waiting to surprise her as she went through. If a longrunner had birdfeet and was skipping over the heads of the crowd to evade pursuit etc                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121834">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121834/#Comment_121834" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-25T02:27:43+00:00" title="January 25, 2008  2:27AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 25, 2008 2:27AM by Paul_T.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome!
