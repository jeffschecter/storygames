Jackson was theoretically facilitating, though we ended up following and then modifying the book's instructions: it suggests that the youngest player should read out the rules, but instead we started with the youngest player (Fran) and then simply passed the book around so that everyone read a different section. This had the amusing effect of Jackson never being the first person who had to do any particular step.<br/><br/>A brief summary of the game: <i>Fuck Youth</i> is a game about exploring what it means to be young. Players are encouraged to incorporate elements from their own youth, and the game takes specific steps to allow players of different ages to synthesize (I believe the game text uses the word 'distill', also appropriate) all their respective experiences, even when those experiences may have in fact happened decades apart.<br/><br/>We began by creating a <b>Secret Place</b>; in this case, it turned out to be a hidden stone cave near the beach, large enough to hold a few people comfortably, and accessible only by crossing a bridge created by a fallen log.<br/><br/>Next, <b>Characters</b>. <br/><br/>As mentioned, each player assigns another player an aspect of youth to serve as an inspiration for their character. Though we mostly boiled these down to specific phrases, the words we picked were often inexact -- we spent a bit of time describing our intentions more thoroughly, and only at the end worried about reducing that to a particular 'X of youth' phrase.<br/><br/>I played Francis, realizing only after I spoke the name that I had inadvertently named my character after one of the other players (Fran), which I generally avoid at all costs (the gender difference seemed adequate to make this a non-issue.) Francis represented the Impulsiveness, or Recklessness, of youth. He was a fidgeter who couldn't keep his hands to himself and was always full of a sort of restless, undirected energy. The sort of kid who when walking through the woods cannot resist picking up a stick and hitting random leaves as he goes along. Francis used to have long hair but then one day he decided to cut it all short by himself. It's now a bit of a mess. I think I also described him as being kind of skinny and wearing black t-shirts and jeans. Francis is 16.<br/><br/>Jen played Catherine, who represented the Ambition of youth. The feeling you have as a youth that anything is possible for you, that all you need to do is apply yourself and you will be a ballerina, doctor, poet, etc. Jen described Catherine as an achiever, very focused on school and similar activities to the detriment of other things -- and starting to feel a little trapped by that. (Ambition of youth was my suggestion, and I do kind of wonder if perhaps Jen felt a little trapped by that suggestion too, but I can't say for sure.) Catherine is 14.<br/><br/>Fran played Tristan, who represented the Clarity of youth. I remember this being described in terms of how young people often live in their own world, which has yet to really come into serious contact with the outside world, and so remains kind of pure -- how they have their own ways of seeing and judging things, and have not yet had to compromise those things. Tristan turned out to be a straight-talking, trouble- (and rollerblading-) loving kid who had no interest in the dissemblances and 'weirdness' of his older friends or siblings. Tristan is 12.<br/><br/>Jackson played Adrian, who represented the Naivete of youth. She was described as having only recently let go of 'uncool' things -- the things that are totally fine to be interested in when you are younger, but then suddenly become unacceptable once you are a teenager. This was later developped (mostly by statements made by other players during the relationship phase) into a sense that Adrian's naivete allowed her to pursue her passions (dorky or otherwise) with passion and focus, because she was usually so unconcerned with what other people would think about them. She is also into photography, which was a cool enough activity to survive the recent purge. Adrian is 15.<br/><br/>Once this initial character sketch is complete, you then go around describing your character's <b>Relationships</b> towards the other characters. This extremely simple step was where the game started to really work for me; we found out far, far more about the characters in this step than we had in the previous one. The unilateral nature of the relationship descriptions -- meaning, that I only described how Francis felt about Catherine, and then later Jen described separately how Catherine felt about Francis -- really helped create rich, layered characterization. Every relationship I came up with for Francis was an opportunity to learn more about both Francis and the other character, and vice versa. None of our relationships were precisely symmetrical (though of course they told two sides of a shared history.)<br/><br/>Francis lives next door to Tristan, and has known him since he was a baby. They used to be really good friends when they were younger, but ever since Francis got to high school the age difference has suddenly become too great, and Francis has stopped playing with Tristan or even interacting much. This relationship was inspired in part by this <a href="http://www.salon.com/life/comics/barry/2000/12/01/barry/print.html" rel="nofollow">absolutely heartbreaking comic by Lynda Barry</a>, which everyone should read. (To be honest, if you don't get that comic, this game probably isn't for you.)<br/><br/>Catherine admires Adrian for her willingness to follow her passions (in contrast to Catherine's own academic focus.) They don't know each other that well, since Catherine has only just started at high school this year, but they are both in the Journalism club.<br/><br/>Tristan and Adrian are siblings. They get along well, and talk all the time. I don't remember what Fran said about Tristan's opinion about Adrian, but Jackson described Tristan as the person Adrian trusted the most -- trusted to know what the right thing was to do, or just to talk to in general.<br/><br/>Francis 'hates' Catherine because she is so focused on achievement, and because she is so oblivious to the possibility that her plans will not work out -- something Francis has become acutely aware of over the last few years, as he starts to think about the nebulous future. It was only after deciding that Francis disliked Catherine that I realized that he is deeply cynical about the possibility that one can actually 'do something cool' with one's life. Or at least, that he can. He resents Catherine not only for being unaware of this 'fact' but primarily because he secretly suspects that somehow she will succeed, whereas he will almost certainly fail. I also added that Francis and Catherine went to the same elementary school, where they were in a class for 'Gifted' kids together -- back then they got along fine, but something has obviously changed.<br/><br/>Pretty much all the details about this relationship were taken from my own life; for example, the "gifted" class and the change of attitude upon entering high school.<br/><br/>Catherine is fascinated and confused by Francis; she can't figure him out at all. "I mean, he <i>cut his own hair!</i> Who does that?" They don't interact much, but at some point not too long ago Catherine was interviewing him for something related to the school newspaper.<br/><br/>Tristan and Catherine take sailing classes together. Catherine likes Tristan but the only way she can figure out how to express that is to act as a kind of controlling mentor, trying to "help" Tristan by offering advice about everything. Tristan likes Catherine too but considers her kind of bossy.<br/><br/>Francis secretly admires Adrian, for her photography and her seeming obliviousness to what other people think about her. Outwardly he acts aloof towards her, and they don't interact much even though they go to the same school. His admiration is non-romantic. Adrian, Tristan and Francis all used to hang out quite a bit when Francis and Tristan were friends, but he was always closer to Tristan than Adrian.<br/><br/>Adrian has a bit of a crush on Francis, though it has not yet reached the full-blown obsessiveness of the capital-C Crush. I don't remember if there was more to it than that (possibly it was Jackson, not Jen, who said the bit about him cutting his hair.)<br/><br/>Tristan also has a crush on Francis, though Fran was not sure whether it was a romantic crush or just a friend-crush. Tristan is confused by the fact that Francis doesn't hang out with him anymore, and kind of hurt too -- but still at the stage where he is hopeful that Francis will just start showing up again, since he can't figure out why they stopped being friends in the first place.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Next up: Stuff starts happening!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_328940">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328940/#Comment_328940" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-10T01:56:19+00:00" title="June 10, 2011  1:56AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 10, 2011 2:50AM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Once characters and relationships are established, players take turns framing scenes for the characters, taking inspiration from a deck of Scene Cards. Three cards are placed face up at a time, and the player whose turn it is to frame a scene chooses the one that looks the most interesting and proceeds from there. The cards contain an evocative title and a limit on the number of characters who can participate in the scene. For example, 'Lies and Truth', a scene for 2 characters, or 'Psychoactive Substances', for 1-3 characters. Particular scene cards are also marked 'Play Immediately', but more on that later.<br/><br/><b>Scene #1: Francis, God of Punk Rock</b><br/>(Scene card: "The Music", 1 or more characters.)<br/><br/>I don't remember who started us off, but the first scene took place in the respective back yards of Francis and Tristan/Adrian. The scene card mentioned 'Music' and so it was proposed that Francis had just acquired an electric guitar, and was currently trying it out in his garage while Tristan and Adrian hung out in their yard next door, eating a lazy breakfast.<br/><br/>Francis was not very good at guitar yet but it turned out that he was very good at making a lot of noise, which I emphasized by making 'rock chord' guitar sounds intermittently throughout the scene. Francis was into punk music. I described how he would start to play what sounded like a song, get two or three bars in, and then stop and start doing something else. I also added that he had apparently gotten his mother to buy him a considerably more heavy-duty amp than the usual starter kit. At some point during the scene he discovered the miracle of feedback, and also playing a chord and then messing with all the knobs on the amp. Electric guitars are awesome!<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Tristan and Adrian are next door, amazed (or perhaps bemused) by the variety of different not-exactly-music-like noises emitting from Francis' garage. Eventually they decide to investigate by hopping the fence -- they used to have a cinderblock that they used for this exact purpose, back when Tristan and Francis were friends, but it has since been moved and so Adrian needs to give Tristan a boost over. Adrian has her camera with her and is intent on getting some pictures, but Tristan (or at least Fran) is already speculating about the possibility of an exposed breaker-box that might control the power to the garage.<br/><br/>When Adrian and Tristan manage to push a picnic table over next to the garage so they can peek in, they see Francis inside, surrounded by old tools and boxes (the garage is used only for storage; there is a carport attached to it, where Francis' mom parks the car.) Francis has cleared a space in the middle of the garage, and laid down an old piece of carpet -- he has his amp and some water and a few guitar tabs/books. The shafts of light coming through the small, high windows of the garage illuminate the dust that is swirling all around the garage. The two of them watch as Francis huddles over his amplifier, playing a chord and then fiddling -- then playing something else and fiddling some more -- until he has, apparently, discovered <i>the perfect guitar sound</i>. Meanwhile, in parallel, we see Adrian fiddling with the settings on her camera, adjusting shutter speeds and apertures in order to account for the unusual light.<br/><br/>At which point Francis steps back, turns around, says "alright Francis, let's do this!" and launches into the most amazing, punk-y-est, astoundingly loud song ever performed in this particular garage, and quite possibly all nearby garages as well. Adrian and Tristan watch as Francis, totally unselfconscious, hops around and spazzes out and occasionally sings a few lyrics, his shaggy, sweaty hair flopping this way and that. <br/><br/>Adrian, totally fascinated, begins to take photographs, but Tristan (who has had his view blocked) soon gets bored. A bored Tristan is never a good thing, and soon he finds his way to the unlocked breaker box, which is installed on an inside wall of the carport. And so it is that, just as Francis begins shredding through the perfect guitar solo, the power to the garage suddenly cuts out -- along with the power to the kitchen, the basement, the washing machine, and the living room (Tristan's not picky.) I describe the intense contrast between the awesome sound of the amped-up electric guitar and the suddenly-emasculated *plink* *plonk* *plink* as the amp cuts out, inadvertently revealing that Francis (as mentioned) is not actually very good at playing guitar at all. Cut off mid-solo, Francis looks wildly around, and spots Adrian just as she lowers her camera and too-slowly tries to duck out of sight.<br/><br/>Fortunately for the siblings, before Francis can begin enacting any revenge he is interrupted by his mother coming out of the house, aggravated at having the TV shut off right in the middle of the movie she was watching. Adrian and Tristan hide together around the corner, while Francis spots both them and the door of the breaker box swinging in the breeze. Slowly coming around to the hilarity of what just happened, Francis does his best to mollify his mother -- "sorry Mom, I must have just rocked out too hard... I think I blew a fuse or something..." -- and cover for the delinquents next door.<br/><br/>By the time his mother has gone back inside, Adrian and Tristan have split back to their backyard, but Francis jumps the fence to visit (his corresponding cinder block is still in place, a detail added by Fran or Jackson, I don't remember which.) By now he's pretty much calmed down, but he makes a show of chewing Tristan out before admitting that the prank was kind of hilarious. But he's also self-conscious about how bad he suddenly sounded once the power went out. He changes the topic to Adrian's camera, asking if she got pictures of him playing -- maybe he could use one for a poster for his band! (It is immediately confirmed that Francis' band consists of... Francis.) Tristan, bored with talk of photographs, heads off to climb their backyard tree, and Francis steals his seat, watching Tristan climb a tree that he himself has surely climbed a hundred times. A few moments pass, and Francis looks around. "Hey, do you guys have any more cereal?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_328942">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328942/#Comment_328942" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-10T02:49:49+00:00" title="June 10, 2011  2:49AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 10, 2011 2:51AM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Scene #2: Rough Waters</b><br/>(Scene card: "The Limits of the Body", 1 or more characters.)<br/><br/>The second scene features Catherine and Tristan at sea. Sailing partners at the club, they have taken a laser out and decided, somewhat unwisely, to sail out past the breakers into the windier, rougher water. Tristan: "Hey, let's go out there...!" Catherine: "Well, okay, sure, I mean... I'm a good sailor, I can do it..."<br/><br/>Everything is going well at first, the boat zooming along, but soon they find themselves much further out than intended, and are struggling to turn the boat safely around. Moreover, the two of them have started to argue about what they should be doing: Catherine, older and technically the skipper, is not so good at thinking on her feet, while Tristan's intuitive approach might help if only Catherine would stop being so bossy.<br/><br/>The argument comes to an abrupt halt when miscommunication sends the boom swinging wildly across the boat, and Catherine can't get out of the way in time -- it smashes into her head, nearly sending her overboard, and the sail suddenly goes slack, leaving them bobbing queasily on the rough water.<br/><br/>Catherine, who may or may not have briefly passed out, is now seeing double and feeling rather nauseous. Tristan is worried, but when the class instructor comes in over the skipper's radio asking if they need help, Catherine answers -- they're fine. And in fact, the argument now postponed, the two do manage to guide the boat carefully back to the dock. I think Catherine may or may not have vomited over the side of the boat on the way (it was floated as a possibility.)<br/><br/>At which point, having reached the dock, the postponed argument explodes into a proper shouting match -- with the whole sailing club watching as Tristan goes after a (probably concussed) Catherine for getting them into trouble with her bossiness, etc. etc. Catherine gets in a few retorts and Tristan stomps off, leaving her to wait for her parents, damp and miserable and still kind of woozy.<br/><br/>When her parents arrive they ask her how the lesson was, and she freaks out in the back seat, crying and telling them all about what happened on the water and the fight with Tristan. She is so upset that her parents ask her if she wants to take a break from sailing lessons, but Catherine says no, she wants to keep going.<br/><br/><br/><b>Scene #3: The Awkwardness of Youth</b><br/>(Scene card: "The Seduction", 2 characters.)<br/><br/>Jackson could hardly resist once this card was turned up. Adrian and Tristan's parents are out of town for the weekend -- leaving behind a depressingly out-of-touch list of instructions, including, per Jackson, "don't fight over the TV -- which we stopped doing, like, two years ago." But in any case, her parents are gone, she has the photographs for bait, and she has a plan. She shows up at Francis' locker at school, and casually invites him over to her place to look at the photographs from his garage rock session, "sometime between 7 and 9." Francis is oblivious to her intentions but totally excited about the photographs, since he thinks she's an amazing photographer. He agrees to come over.<br/><br/>At this point we cut to Adrian in her bedroom, methodically organizing (and then re-organizing) everything -- taking down uncool posters of ponies and hiding her glass figurine collection in the closet and casually placing the photographs on the bedside table. (Tristan is out somewhere, maybe at a friend's house.) It is sometime around this point that she realizes that maybe "sometime between 7 and 9" was not the best way to set the schedule, since now she has up to two hours to spend fretting over her self and her room. She sensibly decides to go downstairs and watch a movie (which turns out later to have been the first part of Casablanca. Whoops.)<br/><br/>Francis is pretty enthused about seeing the photos, though, so he shows up not long after 7, still wearing the same clothes he had on earlier in the day (unlike Adrian, though he doesn't seem to notice.) Adrian explains that the photos are upstairs, in her room. "Cool," says Francis. They go up to her room, and Francis hesitates unconsciously at the door before being properly invited in. A natural fiddler, he immediately starts checking out the newly-manicured room, oblivious to the hole Adrian is staring into his back.<br/><br/>At which point begins a scene of excruciating, tender awkwardness that I cannot possibly reproduce faithfully, at the risk of triggering another flashback, but here goes. <br/><br/>There is nowhere to sit but the bed. Adrian shows Francis the photographs, which are totally great. She asks him what he was thinking in one of them -- he doesn't really know. He says something self-deprecating about how he's not, like, trying to be a real musician, and he's not that good at guitar, and Adrian counters by offering to show him her old photographs, back when she had no idea what she was doing. Said photographs include a remarkable number of pictures of Francis, including one where he is shirtless and watering the lawn. Francis is impressed by the cool blurring effect, where he is swinging the hose around out of boredom. He totally misses the point about these photographs being bad -- he thinks they're awesome. He also totally misses the point about why there so many pictures of him. Adrian enacts the second part of the plan and puts on 'some record' that her cousin recommended to her. It's jazz. She turns the volume way up so it's hard to talk. Francis lies back on the bed and stares at the ceiling, listening to the music. Adrian hovers, hovers some more, then abruptly kisses Francis. It is established by audience questioning that this is Adrian's first kiss. Francis, staring up at Adrian, who is now hovering even closer, finally gets it -- but he has no idea what to do about it, until Adrian kisses him again. Francis kisses her back this time.<br/><br/>* very brief makeouts go here *<br/><br/>Francis breaks off the kissing for reasons that will probably remain unclear to him for the rest of his life. It is almost impossible to speak given the loud jazz music, but he manages to say something very confused about how he really likes Adrian and she's awesome and her photographs are amazing and please don't take this the wrong way but like I've known you forever, we live next door, we're <i>friends</i> and uh, well, uh...<br/><br/>Adrian mostly just hears "you're not cool/good/pretty enough for me" She doesn't really say anything (or if she does I have repressed it), she just hands Francis the photographs and then gets up and walks out and goes to the bathroom and locks herself in.<br/><br/>Francis sits on the bed and feels like he has made a terrible mistake, then after an eternity of doing that he takes the photographs and leaves the house. Tristan is just returning home -- he makes a vague gesture with the photographs and mumbles something unintelligible and goes home.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_328943">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328943/#Comment_328943" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-10T03:16:32+00:00" title="June 10, 2011  3:16AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 10, 2011 3:24AM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Scene #4: Trippin' at the Cave</b><br/>(Scene card: "Psychoactive substances", 1-3 characters.)<br/><br/>Much as Jackson could not resist the lure of teenage seduction, I cannot resist the lure of Francis on acid. I frame a scene at our Secret Place, the cave down by the beach. Francis has acquired some LSD somewhere and has wisely decided that the secret cave nobody except Tristan and Adrian really knows about is the best place to trip. Alone, of course.<br/><br/>However, it turns out that Catherine has also recently learned about the cave -- one day when Tristan and Catherine were sailing by, Tristan told her about it and how he used to hang out there a lot -- and she has come there, hoping to find Tristan so she can talk to him about their big fight at the sailing club. Instead she finds Francis, sitting in the back of the cave, his trip having already begun.<br/><br/>This scene was surely the most concentrated fun I have had in a roleplaying game in a long time. Since I have personally never done acid (though I have heard a fair number of second-hand accounts) I just asked Jackson and Fran to randomly interject with suggestions for me as to what I might be seeing, or feeling, or noticing at any given moment. Unlike the above seduction scene, I think I would have trouble actually remembering everything that happened, or even describing it in a very interesting way.<br/><br/>In any case, Catherine discovered Francis and they had a very strange conversation. Catherine revealed that she knew Tristan, and was looking for him here, and Francis revealed his newfound but profound regret over no longer being Tristan's friend -- he loves Tristan, and thinks Tristan is amazing, and why would he ever stop being friends with someone who was amazing? Francis explains that he thought he had to cut himself off from Tristan, the same way you would trim a leaf from a tree -- "so I would be more aerodynamic." Catherine: "Aerodynamic?"<br/><br/>Somewhere in here Francis casually mentions that he is high, and specifically that he is on acid. Catherine is, unsurprisingly, a little freaked out -- but not any more freaked out than she was about the conversation up to that point.<br/><br/>At this point Francis is distracted by some rocks on the beach, which are arranged in a pattern he can't quite understand. He asks Catherine about them but they look normal to her. Then the ocean starts turning some pretty amazing colours -- he tries to explain it to Catherine, but gets hung up on the name for the similarly-coloured shell ('abalone'). This prompts her to start babbling about the Golden Ratio and how shells in nature grow according to mathematical formula; Francis is impressed by her mathematical ability, and concludes that "if you were on acid, you would totally understand about these rocks."<br/><br/>Catherine continues to be nervous, but Francis asks her about Tristan and invites her to hang out, but not before a brief moment of paranoia: "You aren't going to try to kiss me, are you?!" After being assured on this point, he invites her to sit down. Catherine is baffled by his friendliness, particularly once he (inevitably) suggests that she should drop acid as well. Catherine: "Why would you want to do acid with <i>me</i>?" <br/><br/>There is more conversation -- Francis talks about how difficult everything feels lately, bringing back the aerodynamic tree metaphor and then talking about boats trying to go through rough water, and how they have to be absolutely smooth. Catherine, who is not even on acid, counters that it is the rough water that makes the rocks smooth. They talk about how assured Catherine seems to be that she's going to accomplish everything she wants, and Catherine is surprised, having never considered the possibility.<br/><br/>Eventually, Francis convinces Catherine to drop acid as well, assuring her that he will hang out with her for her trip. The sun is going down and the two of them sit at the edge of the cave, watching the water. The scene ends there, eliding any specifics of Catherine's trip. (As much as I would have loved to see what Catherine was like on acid, it had been a very long scene already.)<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>The remaining 2 scenes and some actual commentary/analysis will have to wait until tomorrow, as this took way longer than anticipated.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_328988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328988/#Comment_328988" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-10T09:43:43+00:00" title="June 10, 2011  9:43AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool read!

In fact we ended up playing well into 'lunch', by general agreement. I think at some point I said "I would rather play this than eat." (That's a Neil-Gaiman-quality blurb for your game, right there, Matthijs. Not that it needs it.)<br/><br/><b>Scene #5: Dumb Girls</b><br/>(Scene Card: "Lies and Truth", 2 or more characters.)<br/><br/>The next scene was between Tristan and Adrian and occurred directly after The Seduction scene above, chronologically. Tristan comes home to find his sister locked in the bathroom, with weird noodly jazz music playing really loud in her room. His brother-senses are tingling! Tristan knocks on the bathroom door but Adrian thinks it's still Francis, so she just ignores it and starts running the sink by way of further communication. After a moment or two though, Tristan makes it clear that it's him, and that Francis has left, and Adrian comes out of the bathroom. It is obvious that she has been crying -- her mascara has run, but she has also washed her face somewhat, so it's not a total disaster.<br/><br/>I wish I could remember more of this conversation, because it really was brilliant. Tristan's personality really emerged here -- perceptive, clear-sighted, even a bit considerate, but still basically twelve years old and not about to take this teenage drama any more seriously than it deserves. The tension for Adrian between wanting to ignore/hide what had just happened and feeling hurt and her trust for her brother also added a great dynamic; Tristan remained fully on-point while Adrian kind of waffled around, trying to figure out how she felt -- or what she wanted to say -- about what had happened.<br/><br/>Adrian started out by dissembling -- first, pretending she's not upset; then, pretending she's upset because Francis didn't like her photographs -- but Tristan just kept shutting her down with the perfect clarity of a 12 year old. Why is she playing weird music really loud? Why does her room look so different? Why is she so upset? Where did all the chairs go? As I put it at the time, Tristan didn't really have the savvy to put 2 and 2 together -- but he was fully aware that there <i>was</i> a 2 and 2 there, and he wasn't going to let Adrian off the hook until she put it together for him.<br/><br/>A few exchanges later and Adrian eventually admits that she "really liked" Francis -- adding that she had no idea why, because he's such a <i>jerk</i>. Tristan agrees that Francis is pretty cool, but also bursts out laughing when her sister confesses her crush and her silly plans. "You're such a dumb girl!" he gloats, which touches a sore spot for Adrian. At that point the conversation had sort of moved towards the 'oh my god that is so funny that I did that ridiculous thing' stage, but the "dumb girl" adds a painful twist. Adrian feels judged by her brother, who she trusts implicitly: "I'm not a dumb girl, am I?" Tristan reassures her a little -- though not without getting a few digs in about how he prefers hanging out with Francis, 'coz he's more fun to climb things with -- but he still thinks its funny/stupid/weird, and the scene ends on a somewhat mixed note.<br/><br/><br/><b>Scene #6: Fourth of July Picnic</b><br/>(Scene Card: "We tire of your foolish scene cards, game designer. Let's just frame a final scene", 4 characters.)<br/><br/>We only had enough time for one more scene and we wanted to get all the characters together at once. Someone suggested a neighbourhood 4th of July picnic, down by the beach. Jackson started off the scene by putting Adrian, Francis and Catherine all in line for hot dog fixings together. Tristan is rollerblading around in the background. Francis and Adrian notice each other first; this is the first time they've run into each other since the failed seduction, even though it's been a few weeks. Francis immediately sees an opportunity to try and make amends -- "I really need to talk to you!" but before they can get into it Catherine shows up. Adrian suggests they all go eat their hot dogs together, somewhat pointedly ignoring the implicit "alone" at the end of Francis' request. But Catherine still has to finish topping her hot dog, so the two of them do get a few minutes together under the shade of a nearby tree as they wait for her. <br/><br/>Francis immediately bursts into impulsive-apologizing mode -- he's been thinking a lot about what happened, obviously, but it turns out he hasn't necessarily figured out anything new to say about it. He mostly just repeats what he said in Adrian's room, but the lack of blaring jazz music and a few weeks removal at least lets Adrian listen a little more clearly this time. If anything Francis seems more concerned that Adrian will think poorly of herself than he is about her opinion of him. I realize during this conversation that Francis is worried that his own cynical viewpoint might somehow infect other people. It also seems likely that the impulsive Francis has been on the other side of similar 'seduction' attempts in the past -- he's projecting his own insecurities and his own reactions right onto Adrian.<br/><br/>For her part, Adrian mostly seems to want Francis to stop talking about it, please, and to never bring it up ever again, thank you. Francis doesn't get that, exactly, but after a few repetitions he finally shuts up about it at least. The two of them lapse into a somewhat awkward silence, and Francis looks back over towards the hot dog area, where Catherine and Tristan have run into each other.<br/><br/>Tristan meanwhile has literally run into Catherine, out of control on his rollerblades, spilling hot dog fixings all over her shirt. It was revealed (I think during the scene framing) that Tristan actually stopped coming to sailing lessons after their fight, so this is the first time they have seen each other since then. Even though running into Catherine was an accident, Tristan can't help but find it hilarious. Catherine kind of plays along, establishing a bit of post-acid-trip enlightenment by being kind of impressed by the "neat patterns" the mustard has made. Tristan thinks that's even funnier, because it looks kind of dumb to him. In any case the topic soon turns to the sailing club, and how Tristan has quit. Tristan is curious who Catherine is sailing with now, and when Catherine names the girl (whose name I forget, sadly), Tristan laughs: "You're sailing with Her? She's SO BORING!" Catherine retorts: "Well she's a better sailor than you." Tristan is stung, and an argument seems to be brewing until Catherine apologizes. "I said she was a better sailor... I didn't say I LIKED sailing with her more than you."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Francis and Adrian are watching this all from afar. Francis says that he's glad they're talking -- "they had a big fight, you know." Adrian had heard about it too, but after a moment's consideration she is confused: "How do you know about that?" Francis reveals that he "hung out" with Catherine, down at the cave, and she told him about it. Adrian becomes immediately suspicious. Hanging out? At the cave? With another girl? Francis doesn't quite notice Adrian's reaction, and when asked he starts to explain about how he was tripping -- but then, impulsively, changes his mind literally halfway through the sentence, deciding that maybe he doesn't need to share that information with Adrian after all. Instead he just talks about how Catherine seemed kind of lonely, and how she had said she "didn't know how to hang out with people." Adrian replies in an annoyed tone that she just invited Catherine to hang out with them -- which it sounds like she would not have done if she knew about this whole "hanging out in the cave" thing. But it's too late now, Catherine and Tristan are coming over.<br/><br/>There's a little bit of meandering, semi-awkward conversation and hot-dog eating and then Francis abruptly leaps to his feet with an idea: "Let's go to the cave!" Nobody disagrees and so the evening finds them all at the secret place, waiting for the fireworks to start. (Francis spends a moment looking at the rocks he was so mesmerized by before, sharing an in-joke with Catherine about how they 'look pretty boring now' -- which does not go unnoticed by Adrian.) Francis compulsively skips rocks, back to his fidgety self. But the cave seems to have a soothing effect, and the four of them lapse into a comfortable, friendly silence as the fireworks begin. Once they're over, someone (I think Catherine) suggests that they should meet again here next year. Everyone agrees: they're all friends now, at least one day a year.<br/><br/>On the way back Tristan makes a comment about how next year he'll be in high school, so they can all hang out together. Francis starts formulating an awkward reply about how, uh, maybe that won't exactly, uh, work -- only to be cut off by Tristan's laughter again. He was just kidding.<br/><br/>(The End.)<br/><br/><br/>Comments to follow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329037">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329037/#Comment_329037" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-10T15:30:50+00:00" title="June 10, 2011  3:30PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 10, 2011 3:49PM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So okay, what do I think about all this? Well, I said elsewhere that this was the highlight of the con for me, and it was -- but not because it had any particularly deep message, or super-emotional scene, or sublimated emotional trauma (well maybe a bit of that). It was the highlight mostly because it was <i>just so easy</i> to play so well. As I said to several people afterwards, the best feeling in gaming is when you feel like you're totally on, and contributing as best you can, and loving your own contributions -- and then on top of that, all your fellow players are playing <i>even better</i> than you. A lot of credit for this has to go to my fellow players, and the setting, and the time of day -- but I think the game delivered, too, even if it delivered in a very modest, self-effacing way. The deliberate tone of the set up instructions, the extremely clear instructions in terms of both what the game was about and what everyone should do -- it made it easy. Jackson is one of my favourite people to game with, but the other two players were strangers to me, and had never played a story game before. They had no trouble understanding the instructions; the main difference in their play compared to mine and Jackson's was, I would say, an even greater willingness to collaborate -- the scene on the sailboat, for example, often involved one or the other of them narrating for each other's character as well as their own -- basically narrating complete interactions, instead of only one side. They switched effortlessly between third-person summary narration and snippets of perfect dialogue. <br/><br/>Jen in particular often came out with these completely perfect bits of Catherine-dialogue, and was a perfect straight man in the psychoactive substances scene. The part where she said "why would you want to drop acid with ME?" was just utterly heartbreaking/endearing/revealing. Fran had several similar moments in the scene between Tristan and Adrian. I'm sure in part these stood out more for me because I didn't know the players (I loved Jackson's contributions, but I kind of know Jackson, so I kind of knew what to expect in general) -- but there was none of that jarring 'oh now I need to adjust to this new player's style' feeling that you sometimes encounter.<br/><br/>And I mean, beyond how easy it was, it was the highlight for me because of the characters we created. Hopefully that's obvious just reading this write-up. I felt genuine affection for every one of them -- I wanted them to be okay, and grow up, and be awesome, and talk to each other and get to know each other better, and help each other become adults one way or another. I still feel bad that Adrian's seduction didn't work out, and I hope that Catherine learns how to 'hang out' and Tristan and Francis at least get to climb trees together sometimes on weekends. I'm worried about how Francis is going to deal with the rest of his life, and I can still hear Tristan's incredulous laugh, which was somehow simultaneously laughing at you and inviting you to laugh along -- one part childlike judgement and one part baffled affection. And honestly, if there is another Fabricated Realities and all of us are there, I hope we get to meet again at the cave, next year, like everyone promised.<br/><br/>It's noticeable, looking back on these scenes, how little anyone bothered to push towards 'conflict' or similar literary notions -- I did make sure that my acid trip 'revelations' matched up with stuff that I knew was going on with the other characters, but beyond that completely trivial reincorporation I barely had to think about what to do, or whether it would 'work', because the game created <i>no expectations</i> about what kind of play would be appropriate. Other than that it had to feel real to you, I guess; that it had to resemble your own experience of youth in some genuine way.<br/><br/>It was also easy because the game gave permission -- or even encouragement -- to recycle from my own experience of youth. Francis played guitar in <i>my</i> garage -- my big concrete bunker of a garage, with the carport attached -- and Francis' mother came out of <i>my</i> house (ironically, out of my father's house; my parents were separated) into <i>my</i> backyard. I had a single mom and so did Francis. When everyone was trying to figure out what extra-curricular activity Tristan and Catherine shared, I suggested my own childhood sailing club -- and later Jackson described a Laser (a type of boat), presumably straight out of his own youth. Even the secret cave looked in part like a cave I knew from a beach near a family vacation house. And I certainly never had a crush on any girls from my elementary school 'gifted' classes!<br/><br/>But Francis sure wasn't me, either. He was skinnier and liked punk music and I was probably the <i>least</i> reckless teenager around. His impulsiveness freed me to have him do things I would never do (like drop acid by himself.) I like to imagine that everyone else experienced a similar internal tension/freedom between the wealth of their own real youthful experience, and the game's own input. I certainly found it liberating to have all this private (and therefore surprising to the other players), very concrete stuff I could fall back on if necessary, while still actively pursuing this new, fictional character -- a kind of new half-self, partly me and partly completely not.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Next: on scene cards.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329039/#Comment_329039" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-10T15:42:14+00:00" title="June 10, 2011  3:42PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>When you've finished the right up, I'm going to be very interested to hear what you thought of the game mechanically.<br/><br/>Particularly, I'd be interested to hear if anyone had an urge to create new possible scene cards part way through or in post game discussions.</blockquote>\nSo okay, attentive people with a lot of time on their hands to read have probably already noticed that Scene <a href="/forums/search?Search=%236&amp;Mode=like">#6</a> does not correspond to any particular Scene Card, and that we basically just made up the scene we wanted. And attentive people who have also played the game may be wondering how we managed to get 6 scenes into the game without drawing any of those pesky 'PLAY IMMEDIATELY' cards.<br/><br/>It turns out that while we followed the game's set-up instructions nearly to the letter, our adherence to the rules concerning scene framing and scene cards ebbed as the game proceeded. We drew a 'PLAY IMMEDIATELY' card -- 'Who's Against Them', 1 character -- I think after the 3rd scene, but we basically ignored it because none of us had any good ideas to use it. I had already come up with something for the Psychoactive Substances card, and so we just went with that instead -- and once we had skipped it once, nobody felt compelled to follow its imperious instructions. Eventually I think we just discarded it, to get a different 3rd card for future scenes.<br/><br/>Similarly, the Lies and Truth card was chosen after we had all brainstormed a good quick scene that would fit in before our last scene -- though in this case I think the card name was a) very appropriate, and b) Jackson definitely had it inform his play of Adrian, once the scene started. So that was still mostly within the scope of the rules.<br/><br/>But then for the last scene, we just ignored the cards completely. What's that about?<br/><br/>I think what it really comes down to (besides time pressure and wanting to get everyone in to what we knew was the last scene) is that by that point we were so confident in our play that we didn't really need to worry that we were somehow going to screw things up by not following the rules. We used the cards at first because they helped (quite a bit, I love the cards in general) get things going, but once things were going we weren't that worried about using the cards. That said, the cards remained there just in case we had to fall back on them, or in case they sparked something; it's not that we disengaged with them completely, it's just that sometimes we didn't actually use them completely either.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329094">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329094/#Comment_329094" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-10T22:50:43+00:00" title="June 10, 2011 10:50PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks ICE, I really appreciate the follow up answer.<br/><br/>It kinda confirms something I suspected about this game after reading it.

Whoever seems to be most attuned to the group vibe (measured by how many cards are reincorporated) just facilitates/runs/instructs the final scene.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329101">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329101/#Comment_329101" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-11T00:17:01+00:00" title="June 11, 2011 12:17AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matthijs, ICE<br/><br/>What do you think would happen if rather than randomly drawing a card to replace the last scene card used, the player who just set the last scene was allowed to go through the remaining deck and pick a replacement card?<br/><br/>I like the randomness of the initial draw, but I wonder what would change positively with that rules kink.<br/> <br/>Another question: Did you take any breaks and do something out of game, while still talking about the game? For example, when I played several story games with Caesar_ X and others, including Archipelago, we'd commonly get settled in, go through the rules, play through a turn or so each, then break for lunch/snacks, and return to the game. During the more casual period we'd naturally visit about non-game stuff, but also freely discuss stuff about the fiction we were creating.<br/><br/>It was after those sorts of informal, non-game breaks that we tended to come back and really drive forward pretty intensely. I think we also tended to break again, with more story discussion and a shorter period of non-game time, as we geared up for stuff clearly coming to game-close.<br/><br/>Did either of you folks experience a similar pattern?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329102">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329102/#Comment_329102" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-11T00:20:54+00:00" title="June 11, 2011 12:20AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Robert (or do you prefer Bob?), I'm guessing that going through the deck would take a lot of time.

A bit like the way Fiasco allows either choosing or resolving a scene, but at a higher level. By picking the replacement scene card, the player would indicate their interest, but not have much control in either the interpretation of the card or who gets to choose it ( at least until it comes back to their turn if the card is still available. Of course, if it is still available, their own initial idea for it may have become estremely modified by any intervening fiction).<br/><br/>As regards breaks, it's just a peculiar interest of mine. Part of what I like about Story Games often is that they seem to observe naturally occuring group behavior, them formalize them into useful processes/tools. One common element I've noticed with successful play, whether very traditional rpgs or story game hippy stuff is that break time with out of game activities seems to recharge folks ( leading to more intense play following it) and also offer a period where free exchange of ideas can occur with little to no commitment to them ( although incoporation of bandied about ideas seems very common, and positive).<br/><br/>Naturally of course, I'm trying to steal idea for my own projects. I hope you don't mind!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329104/#Comment_329104" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-11T00:41:38+00:00" title="June 11, 2011 12:41AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't remember if we took a break during the game; on the one hand, it seems likely, since it was a fairly long block of time, but on the other hand I remember play as being pretty much continuous, except for the occasional visitor who Jackson had to shoo away due to feeling shy about observers. Maybe Jackson will chime in if he remembers any breaks, etc.<br/><br/>I tend to agree with Matthijs that going through the deck would be both somewhat time-consuming and also (more concernedly) lead to pre-planning to some degree, which is something I think the game mostly tries to avoid.<br/><br/>The PLAY IMMEDIATELY cards do seem to kind of have their own agenda, in the sense of perhaps introducing 'outside' bits and pieces to play; possibly they are intended to apply pressure to the story or the characters, I don't know, but in this particular game that just didn't seem appropriate. This was not really a high-drama setup; these characters, at least as far as we got to know them, did not really have serious issues or problems or external forces arrayed against them. (Even the 'Secret Place is Discovered' card, when it came up, felt out of synch; mostly because we just hadn't introduced anyone 'outside' the characters, who might conceivably have made the discovery.) <br/><br/>We naturally gravitated to the scene cards that seemed to fit what had already been established, rather than those that would have introduced challenging new elements. Possibly if we had been playing the game over several more sessions, these cards would have become more attractive, as the starting character relationships were more fully explored and understood.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
