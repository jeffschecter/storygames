                    I present to you the new <b><a href="https://teylen.blog/2019/01/06/crowdfunding-collection-91/" rel="nofollow">Crowdfunding Collection no.91, including every tabletop project started between 01/01 till 01/06.</a></b><br/><br/>A happy New Year to everyone and welcome to the first collection of  2019.<br/>I do really like the rpg Patreon project by <b>Liz and Steffie</b>. While the project isn’t dedicated to a single game, by the nature of Patreon, I am really curious what the two will produce and look forward to those games.<br/>f you like the Era games, you might be happy that you got the chance to lay your hands on a limited edition of <b>Era: Lyres</b>. <b>Adventure Post</b> was a bit of a chellenging project. It isn’t a straight up tabletop rpg, but got some other game elements. I still think it is worth having a look.<br/>As well as the <b>'TWAS – The Krampus Night Before Christmas</b> gamebook by Jonathan Green, who I backed previously for his gamebook take on Alice in Wonderland. He is a good creator, and I recommend checking the project out.<br/>The <b>Deco Dice</b> by Mark Kelly didn’t only get to be the „preview/cover project“, but it is the only project I backed. The dice look super cool, Mark is a gifted artist and a nice person and I watched the project preparation for month. Thus it comes with the highest recommendations from my part.<br/>There are plenty more projects, just take a look:<br/><br/><b>English Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>4 Role-Playing Games<br/>1 Gamebook<br/>1 Supplement<br/>4 Adventures<br/>4 Dice Projects<br/>1 Accessorize<br/>2 Card Projects<br/>2 Various Projects<br/><br/>Article: <a href="https://teylen.blog/2019/01/06/crowdfunding-collection-91/" rel="nofollow">https://teylen.blog/2019/01/06/crowdfunding-collection-91/</a> </div>

                            I present to you the new <a href="https://teylen.blog/2019/01/13/crowdfunding-collection-92/" rel="nofollow">Crowdfunding Collection no. 92, including every tabletop project started between 01/07 till 01/13</a>.<br/><br/>Amon the games this time round you’ll find <b>Land Under the Flames</b>. A game with a fantasy setting which will see the players character and tribe develop through the years and epochs. The setting and concept sounds interesting, yet the information regarding the system is a bit scarce – maybe to be found on the games website. I personally do like <b>The Bone Marshes</b> a bit more. It’s closer to actually being a fantasy rpg adventure, yet it does come with a small OSR-like system of its own to help one explore marshes in hex’es. Then there <b>Clockwork Depths</b>, which combines tabletop rpg and LARP with a setting of their own. It’s an alternative world to our own, with lot more of underwater action and some (in my opinion) steampunk influences. The last of the games, <b>Station Keepers</b>, offers quite and interesting approach to Kickstarter next to its Science Fiction setting. While the game will be about the characters trying to loot a space station under the creators watch, neither the system nor the setting has been formulated it. Which isn’t unintentional bad Kickstarter design, but an experiment by the creator. Though am hesitant about it, as money is involved.<br/>Next to those projects you’ll find plenty more interesting ones, just take a look:<br/><br/><b>English Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>4 Role-Playing Games<br/>3 Supplements<br/>1 Setting<br/>3 Adventures<br/>1 Dice Project<br/>1 Accessoire<br/>1 Soundscape<br/>1 LARP Project<br/>1 Comic<br/>1 Coloring Book<br/>3 Various RPG Projects<br/><br/>Article: <a href="https://teylen.blog/2019/01/13/crowdfunding-collection-92/" rel="nofollow">https://teylen.blog/2019/01/13/crowdfunding-collection-92/</a> </div>

                            I present to you the new <a href="https://teylen.blog/2019/01/20/crowdfunding-collection-93/" rel="nofollow"><b>Crowdfunding Collection no. 93, including every tabletop project started between 01/14 till 01/20.</b></a><br/><br/>This time around I’ll have two projects from Germany, one in English.<br/>The one in English is <b>ADOM</b>, which transforms the old CRPG classic by the same name into a tabletop rpg, while I do not know the original game the project looks okay. <b>Die Schwarze Katze</b> is a game in which one assumes the role of a sentient, two-legged cat in the world of The Dark Eye. The presentation is excellent, I followed its development for years and one can even play vampire cats! thus I am backing it. I would say, have a look at it if you like cats ^^<br/>Back to the English games, I recommend <b>Vulcania</b>, it looks cool and had me coin the term „vulcan punk“. Why… Why not? If you are more a fan of cyberpunk take a look at <b>Carbon 2185</b>. It looks charming and promising. Then again maybe you want to play a dragon in modern time, then you should take a look at <b>Lex Draconis</b>. Well, and if you like more some Indy-like action in the 30s, check out <b>Destination Danger</b>.<br/>Next to the games and as a big WoD fan I do wholeheartedly recommend backing the <b>Patreon of Mr Gone</b>, Chris creates and shares excellent character sheets and he deserves the support. I am as well enamored with the <b>Damsels, Dice, and Everything Nice</b> project, as I greatly enjoy their first episode.<br/>Though there are plenty more interetsing projects:<br/><br/><b>German Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>2 Role-Playing Games<br/><br/><b>English Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>3 Role-Playing Games<br/>3 Fantasy Role-Playing Games<br/>4 Supplements<br/>1 Setting<br/>2 Adventures<br/>2 Dice Projects<br/>1 Accessoire<br/>2 YouTube Series<br/>2 Enamel Pins<br/>2 Map Projects<br/>2 Art Projects<br/>3 Various RPG Projects<br/><br/><b>Spanish Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Role-Playing Game<br/><br/>Article: <a href="https://teylen.blog/2019/01/20/crowdfunding-collection-93/" rel="nofollow">https://teylen.blog/2019/01/20/crowdfunding-collection-93/</a> </div>

                            I present to you the new <b><a href="https://teylen.blog/2019/01/27/crowdfunding-collection-94/" rel="nofollow">Crowdfunding Collection no. 94, including every tabletop project started between 01/20 till 01/27.</a></b><br/><br/>Usually I don’t put German projects front and forward in the English version of the Crowdfunding Collection, yet <b>Roll Inclusive: Diversity und Repräsentation im Rollenspiel</b> is really near and dear to my heart. Thus, if you are interested in inclusivity from a German perspective, if you understand German or if you want to support the creators, I recommend the project wholeheartedly.<br/>Among the English projects <b>Wolfspell</b> stood out to me because of the cool artwork and the idea to play humans who transform into wolfs – without being werewolves.  <b>Zorro</b> does look cool as well, yet am not a fan of the swashbuckling genre or the titular hero and hence just suggest to check the game out if you are. <b>In Name Only</b> doesn’t wow me with great illustration, but the rules-light story game appears well worth giving it a closer look.<br/>Among the other projects I am most enticed by the first three dice ones, which look quite stunning. Though I do recommend that you take a glance at all the other projects as well:<br/><br/><b>German Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 RPG Literature<br/><br/><b>English Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>3 Role-Playing Games<br/>4 Supplements<br/>2 Adventures<br/>4 Dice Projects<br/>3 Accessoires<br/>2 Various RPG Projects<br/><br/><b>French Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>2 Role-Playing Games<br/>1 Gamebook Collection<br/><br/>Article: <a href="https://teylen.blog/2019/01/27/crowdfunding-collection-94/" rel="nofollow">https://teylen.blog/2019/01/27/crowdfunding-collection-94/</a> </div>
