Usually, certain powers are tied to certain levels, or have pre-requisites that effectively give them a minimum level. This is one of the things that has people saying Sauron is at least a level 12 Wizard, and Gandalf is at least a level 5 Wizard (not unreasonable actually, but Sauron is level 12 instead of 11 or 10 because he made a magical ring). If you're trying to go with a particular character concept, you probably won't get the powers necessary to realise it until you've been playing for a while. Given how hard it is to schedule just one gaming session, expecting to have a campaign going for the weeks/months necessary to reach that level is pretty unrealistic.<br/><br/>At the same time, it's pretty cool increasing in power, and the level concept is pretty appealing. Having a nice number that roughly gauges how powerful you are is satisfying. <br/><br/>So, what are ways of making sure a player has access to pretty much everything as far as concept goes, so they can have the character they want at 'level 1', while still giving that rather intangible satisfaction of going up in level (whenever that happens).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324870">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred" title="Wightbred"><img alt="Wightbred" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/349/nEG30XDP3MO0A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred">Wightbred</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324870/#Comment_324870" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-17T03:54:00+00:00" title="May 17, 2011  3:54AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've done this in a <a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?board=32.0" rel="nofollow">hack</a> recently, so I think I know what you mean.

Give Power points per level? So, if you've got 10 Power points to spend on your character's powers at level 1, you could have ten powers at 1-point each, one power at 10-points or anything in-between. Pick to customise your character and get the kind of play experience you want.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Give Stunt points per level? You can spend a Stunt point to do something your character hasn't got a power in; it's that trick they pull off once, but it costs them a great deal to do it, though eventually they might master it (i.e. spend the XP points to buy that power permanently)<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Base all rolls on character level and power level? Any character can attempt any power allowed for their class, but the roll always has a modifier equal to the character's level minus the power's level, e.g. a level 5 character attempting a level 1 power gets a +4 modifier, but a level 1 character attempting a level 5 power has<br/>\na -4 mod.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. As above, but with energy point expenditure: the base cost for any power is proportional to it's level, but you modify that cost by your character level, so powers at a lower level than your character's cost less, but higher level powers cost more.<br/>\n<br/>\n5. Price dice? You can try any power, rolling dice equal to its level, but each die that comes up a '1' costs the character a price; they can modify this price by their character level. Price could be wounds/hit points or something more narrative, like negative marks against a character trait, goal or flaw.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324876">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324876/#Comment_324876" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-17T04:47:09+00:00" title="May 17, 2011  4:47AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd have to say that the best approach here would be to drop some of the preconceptions involved. Either get rid of character concepts as fundamental building blocks of play experience or get rid of power levels and character development. The former, especially, is ass insofar as I'm concerned, while the latter is far from necessary for a satisfying roleplaying game. It's difficult to view trying to keep hold of both as anything but being a stick in the mud.<br><br>I know that isn't a very positive answer, but the question is almost painful in its D&amp;D underpinnings. Ever since '90s we get this very syndrome in D&amp;D, as players try to embrace both zero-to-hero power development mechanics and "character concepts" suitable for heroic fantasy at the same time. That's heartbreak city, man, you need to let it go. Accept that a game where you go up in power is not about preconceived character concepts anyway, and it's especially not going to be about concepts underpinned by what the character can or can't do.<br><br>If I absolutely had to do this thing, I'd likely go into it by attacking the player's sense of entitlement concerning what characters he wants to play. Make the player want to play a character concept who can't do anything and isn't interesting because they have a flying carpet or whatever, and the problem disappears. This might be achieved by bringing the players into the game from a viewpoint that is not character-centric, so as to prevent them from pre-developing an image of what character they want to play. Character-concept entitlement often comes from feeling that your brilliant prose as character-actor is more important than the game's setting fidelity, for example, so one way of encouraging players to keep an open mind is to give the game a flavourful setting and a strong campaign concept that intuitively clashes with unique snowflake character concepts. Set the game on a spaceship archology with 108 passengers in cryofreeze, for example, and create all these people yourself as 1st level characters; explain to the players that they'll get to choose their characters from among these people (put them into a folder or something), and each time one gives up on the quest or dies they'll need to pick another. This concept is so quirkily specific that it should for the most part kill any budding ideas about playing a zombie-riding halfling knight the player might have been fostering even before the campaign was introduced. And when he doesn't have a character concept (or not one he made himself, anyway), he can't get disappointed about not getting to play it, either.<br><br>Another route to take would be to make character concepts and leveling completely lateral to each other. <i>Polaris</i> is a model piece of work in this regard: you can describe your character as whatever, but real effectiveness comes from how desperate the character is. This sort of thing obviously involves creative trade-offs, as "leveling" without discrete details, while concepting-proof, is also going to be somewhat illusionary and arbitrary; while Polaris seems like your character is gaining levels, in reality he's just moving along a predetermined desperation railway towards the last stop in demonville. You can't have both interesting growth and static character concepts at the same time, so some sort of compromise is going to be involved one way or another in solving this conundrum.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_324888">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324888/#Comment_324888" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-17T06:19:06+00:00" title="May 17, 2011  6:19AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>Character-concept entitlement often comes from feeling that your brilliant prose as character-actor is more important than the game's setting fidelity,</blockquote>\nI don't think this is true. It might come up in some situations, but it's far more often that a thematically appropriate character doesn't fit within the power constraints. It's a big problem for point buy systems too.\n<blockquote> Set the game on a spaceship archology with 108 passengers in cryofreeze, for example, and create all these people yourself as 1st level characters; explain to the players that they'll get to choose their characters from among these people (put them into a folder or something), and each time one gives up on the quest or dies they'll need to pick another.</blockquote>\nThis is pretty much Classroom Deathmatch. It's something I'd be willing to play at a convention, and I suppose would work for introducing people to RPGs, but eventually they're going to want more, and so would I. If you're dealing with a one shot situation, advancement becomes irrelevant. If you've got  a game that has an undetermined end time, based on whether people want to keep playing, having some sort of advancement, and making sure that it's a character players want to invest time into is pretty valuable.

I mean, I know how buggery it can be to take a character concept and try to use the rules to build it, bit by bit, according to the blueprint in your head, and often, it can't be done just right. But M&amp;M at least gives you that feeling of really being able to tweak every bit of your character to get it just right. I'm pretty fond of the new 3rd edition M&amp;M, and was toying with the idea of running a fantasy steampunk campaign with it, starting characters at Power Level 6 (so they're not particularly powerful, but not exactly 1st Level), but with limits as if they were Power Level 10 (Power Level determines not only how many points you have to build your character, but also caps how powerful you can make certain aspects...and Power Points and Power Level, after character creation, are not necessarily connected...so you can have characters gain more Power Points, but still not increase their Power Level, until, say, they perform some mighty game-world-affecting deeds).<br/>And even though I like 3E M&amp;M, 2E M&amp;M does offer, currently more source material, and has a supplement specifically for fantasy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lantern314" title="lantern314"><img alt="lantern314" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lantern314">lantern314</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324904/#Comment_324904" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-17T09:17:54+00:00" title="May 17, 2011  9:17AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I conceive of games in two categories, being games and becoming games. Being games are where the fun is putting on a new character and doing the things they can do (Fiasco, Call of Cthulhu, one shot games). Becoming games are where the fun comes from getting to do new cool things with that character (D&amp;D). <br/><br/>I think that you end up with some dissonance when you take a game designed for becoming and start with an image in your head of a fully realized character. This is what happens when you plan out your D&amp;D character before the campaign starts. In my case this results in me pre-playing my character so all of the interesting stuff happened as back-story and I don't have anything to work with when I play. <br/><br/>You also get dissonance when you take a genre all about being and force a becoming system on it. DC Heroes 2nd edition is my poster child for this. When I imagine a supers character I imagine Superman, not some guy with super strength that will over time become superman.

It only happened to be a ring because Tolkien was tapping into the whole Beowulf-Iron Age-Ring Giver thing. If he'd made a staff instead ("one staff to bind them...."), then undoubtedly Tolkien fans writing the D&amp;D rules would have prioritized staves over rings. <br/>So it being a ring is irrelevant.<br/>- I'm gonna agree with Eero on this one: \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>You can't have both interesting growth and static character concepts at the same time, so some sort of compromise is going to be involved one way or another in solving this conundrum.</blockquote> Yep! <br/>The key is that Eero is talking about personal growth, while you seem to be talking about only becoming more powerful. Is that a fair assessment, Robin? If so, then we risk talking past each other. <br/><br/>What games have you played that had enjoyable advancement mechanics?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324942">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324942/#Comment_324942" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-17T11:56:16+00:00" title="May 17, 2011 11:56AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm mainly focusing on power development, but personal growth could be a part of it.<br/><br/>I'm quite fond of Dragonlance 5th Age's handling of it. Mechanically someone who has completed 2 quests is the same as someone who has completed 15 quests, it's just the latter has a larger hand size. The hand size affects the probabilities, roughly the equivalent of playing GURPS and having a starting character roll under with 3d6, and a more advanced character roll 5d6 and drop the 2 highest. You do end up getting more powerful simply because you consistently perform better as a result of having a larger hand, but you've got the same abilities you started with (usually). There's a number of ways to do this mechanically, I'm thinking of a couple of Cortex hacks that could implement it.<br/><br/>I actually don't mind D&amp;D either, depending on how it goes. In the case of Druids, level advancement is interesting to me because of the structure of the druidic order in the D&amp;D world, as well as the fact that you can get a Shapeshifter kit to turn into a small animal at level 1, so the only thing that's missing is certain spells. There it helps that advancement is tied to more than just power, but it's also worth pointing out that not everyone is interested in druids. I also like Psionicists, but for them you can get about 80% (rough estimate) of the powers at level 1 (just not all at the same time). That lets you grab a concept and go with it, and only a very few of them wouldn't be realised right away.<br/><br/>I also enjoy A Dirty World, which skips any pretense of power increase, assuming that of course everything scales, and makes significant changes to character ability across a session and even a scene. It also helps that it doesn't get stale due to power regress. FATE doesn't draw me in quite as much, but the skill pyramid shuffle works nicely as an admission that everything would end up scaling anyway, so what's the point of getting more powerful if every enemy does too? There it's simply the fact that it's change that is nice. At the same time, it's not something that will appeal to everyone, as the illusion of power advancement (or sometimes the reality of it, particularly pre-d20) can be quite satisfying.<br/><br/>As for not having interesting growth and static character concepts at the same time, I guess it depends on how fleshed out the character is. The first character I wanted to make for D&amp;D was the Monkey Spirit, as I'd just read it. Of course what I had in mind was an anthropomorphic monkey martial artist who wields a staff (human stats with monkey trappings would have been fine, and the Mystic class from RC would have worked nicely). I didn't specifically have the idea of a super powerful god with a magical staff that can blast anything in mind, I more had the character portrait in mind. <br/><br/>The problems I'm thinking more with having abilities tied to power comes in say playing a Druid just with the PHB and having to wait to level 7 to change into an animal (or level 5 in d20), or being interested in a particular spell that isn't necessarily game breaking or excessively powerful but isn't available until level 3 or 5. Or even worse, playing a 3.5 Ranger and having to wait until level 2 to get two weapon fighting (the last one being the most absurd given that an iconic class feature got moved to 2nd level so people wouldn't multiclass into 1 level of Ranger and get out).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_325119">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325119/#Comment_325119" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-18T11:53:42+00:00" title="May 18, 2011 11:53AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the idea of modeling character power growth through achievements in the game's fiction.
