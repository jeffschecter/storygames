It NEEDS to be a topic, so people can see, and understand what is about to dominate them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWEGS.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy gaming group discovered this game thanks to Larry's demo at Icon, and we haven't been able to stop raving about it since. We went home and singlehandedly recreated every aspect of the game after the demos just so we wouldn't have to wait until Gencon to be able to play it. Icon was like 4 months ago, and at the moment WEGS is our DAILY game of choice. Some of my friends are so addicted to the game that they just can't stop. Sure gaming tables at Cons will flourish or die dependant on lots of minute details and tricks that people can employ to guarantee a good turnout - but this does not in any way reflect just how hands down awesome the game is.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to reassure everyone out there who hasn't had a chance to play this game, and won't until the basic books are released - hold onto your hat, because a maelstrom of intensity is about to take the gaming world by storm. I'm not affiliated with WICK at all, but I can say that every person I know who's touched WEGS, and been a part of that frantic vegas style poker chip spointing dice rolling action, has not been able to put the game down. If you're at a Con - free food and booze, or flashy index cards might get you the gamers of the moment, but it takes a really super sweet game to keep the gamers hooked long after the convention lights have flickered off.<br/>\n<br/>\nWEGS is that game! I'm not just whistling dixie here people. Consider me a prophet giving you omens of the future. Pandoras box has been opened, my friends, and will be completely open at Gencon this year.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd inside that box, are spoints.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_85328">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85328/#Comment_85328" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-03T10:03:04+00:00" title="August  3, 2007 10:03AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Link?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_85329">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85329/#Comment_85329" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-03T10:11:30+00:00" title="August  3, 2007 10:11AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm also really looking forward to the release of WEGS.

What sort of "great fun" is it, and how?</br></blockquote>\nI've played WEGS a few times at conventions--most recently at Historicon and Dexcon.  It's 'great fun' to me because--at least the way it is played at conventions--it's simple sword and sorcery tactical combat.  Players choose a race and a class right out of standard fantasy tropes, more or less:  Humnz, Elfs, Gnobbits, Dwarfs, Sages, Warriors, Rogues etc.  It's sort of 'tongue in cheek' without being satirical--I think.  Mechanically, characters (called 'arks' in the game...I guess from 'arketypes') have abilities rated by percentage.  Achieving success in an action required rolling less than the ability (thus the rolling 2d10 as percentile dice).  Each ark also has a number of spell points (spoints) that can be used to increase the relevant ability; 1 spoint = 10 percentage points for a single roll.  I enjoy the resource management feature this entails.  In addition, each character class gets special abilities, which are indicated on several index card handouts.  During play, players can play the cards to gain certain bonuses to actions or other abilities--and for magic users, most of the cards are spells.  Most of the cards also require a 'cold roll' to set the difficulty of successfully using the ability.  A cold roll is rolling 2d6 and reading the result as a percentage, with the higher die always the tens and the lower die the ones.  So, what's great fun to me as a player is that in a turn, I can play a card to try an action, roll 2d6 to determine the possibility of success, pay spoints to increase the probability, then roll percentile dice to actually try the action--the point is, there is a lot going on but everything the player needs to know is on the character sheet and on the action or spell cards.  And the poker chips, representing spoints, are being tossed back and forth.  It has a 'feel' of constant excitement and tension.  <br/>So far, the games I've been in at conventions have been fights or series of fights.  I'm not sure how much beyond that WEGS will try to get, nor would I think they want to get.  <br/>One other feature that I enjoyed from playing WEGS at Ubercon back in Oct was that whenever a player tried to do something that wasn't covered in the rules, Larry Wick--who was running the game--would roll percentile dice to determine the obstacle and then the player would try to roll under the obstacle.  Totally random obstacle, but it wasn't 'No'...it was 'Yes, but...(here's the roll you need to make)'.  I appreciated that technique but it has nothing really to do with WEGS as written, as far as I know.<br/>Mel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_85370">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/forlorn1" title="forlorn1"><img alt="forlorn1" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/n6SIEC3F01EX7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/forlorn1">forlorn1</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85370/#Comment_85370" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-03T11:10:36+00:00" title="August  3, 2007 11:10AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played at Dexcon and had a blast.  And yes Larry is a very nice guy.  <br/><br/>The 30 second version is that it is every bit of junior high D&amp;D I every played crossed with a bad night at Vegas (but you get to keep your money) and a wacky sense of humor.  And it is a blast.<br/><br/>It smells like a traditional fantasy miniatures/rpg game, but nothing takes itself too seriously.  How can you when fireballs have been replaced by Fryballs of grease that expand every inning, for 4 innings encompassing more stuff.  And yup, it doesn't have rounds but innings.  At the top of the inning all spellcasters with active spells must ante up a spell point (spoint) which is loudly heralded by the GM crying "Spante".  Gobins are huge with horns, gnomes and hobbits have been condensed into gnobits.<br/><br/>The interesting dice mechanic is to roll 2d6 and treat the digits as percentiles, then add 20 and try to roll under that on regular percentiles.  I think its called a Cold Roll, but I forget if thats the right term.  And you can spend spoints (even if you aren't a spellslinger you still get spoints) to add 10 to the number you want to roll under.  Double digits on the percentiles do good things, rolls that end in 0 do bad things.<br/><br/>Its just a ball of wackiness, and his scenarios, while blasphemous to the cannon of serious fantasy gaming, are hugely fun.<br/><br/>Will I be buying it, you betcha ya.  There is too much goodness in there not to.<br/><br/>Will we play it long term campaign wise, I'm guessing not.  It'll be a great game to bring out when other stuff falls through, but I can't see it really doing lengthy character driven drama well.<br/><br/>And from our game we learned that we must all fear Bill's Laird...<br/><br/>Jeff                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_85371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85371/#Comment_85371" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-03T11:10:57+00:00" title="August  3, 2007 11:10AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Larry is a nice guy, and he paid for all his art on time.

The NPCs, as far as I know, can't use 'spell points' (spoints) to improve the chance of success for an action although NPC spellcasters can use spoints to cast spells...that may just be how the GMs were playing for the convention, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_85405">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickNovitski" title="NickNovitski"><img alt="NickNovitski" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/192/nO35O3RI2BE32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickNovitski">NickNovitski</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85405/#Comment_85405" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-03T13:46:24+00:00" title="August  3, 2007  1:46PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This thread seems to represent an amusing take on the concept of "Directed Promotion."<br/><br/>That said, it sounds like a simpler, more comedic version of Warhammer Quest, which is an appealing concept.<br/><br/>That said, I'll refrain from making a decision until we can read reviews by thoughtful people who have had opportunity to both play and read the game.

I posted this message earlier this afternoon and look at all the responses I've gotten.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm playing WEGS in an hour with my gaming group, and yes I'm looking forward to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone here who's played this game has done the little mini scenarios at the cons. Our gaming group completely recreated the game, and at Larry's behest and approval, have spent the last 4 months hacking and mangling the game trying to break it by playing a several month long campaign, and orchestrating massive plotlines, character driven storylines, huge battle scenes, and adding new skills and abilities by the tenfold every week.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I have to stress more than anything else, is that this game IS what it seems to be, but in fact can be much MUCH more depending on the level that you want to go with it. Take it from me that everyone who has thought they have seen what WEGS can do, is only lightly touching the surface of just how deep the system can go. Copper level gaming hasnt' really been touched upon by cons, because what point is there to leveling up a character, and creating one of thousands of potential new abilities, when everyone has to leave in a couple hours anyway. <br/>\n<br/>\nWEGS finds a fantastic use for all of those warhammer 40k pieces sitting around your house, or can use really anything to represent your characters. To play the game well, you're really going to need to invest in a quality set of poker chips, at least 4 different colors. Black chips for enemy levels, blue chips for allies levels, white chips for single spoints, and single 10 wound chips, red chips for 4 spoints and lost action phase markers, and so forth. A nice big checkered table cloth would do nicely, and so would a copper urn to toss spoints into, but our gaming group uses 2 chess boards, a giant hex map, and a fedora for that back alley craps like feel.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the con level, gameplay moves really really fast, since it's only a few characters and a handful of monsters with a simple plotline and a tongue in cheek feel. Sure, that's Larry Wick's thign when it comes to getting people hooked, but don't think that this is the limitation to the system! OH NO MY FRIENDS! This game can be expanded to the stars and beyond! Our group controls 2 characters simultaneously - a primary, and a secondary. That way battles can be larger, and the campaigns can be more epic. Never before has there been a role playing system that ceamlessly integrates everything you need to have really really cool tactically oriented battles. Sure in other systems where there are plenty of abilities that focus on non-combat oriented interaction with the world, allow you to get more in depth with things, but it's this fact that makes WEGS really shine. Instead of focusing on all of the extra details, WEGS allows you to get to the core of battle unlike any other system. Regular rpgs that don't use hex maps (and I never EVER use maps or miniatures for any of the rpgs I've played, and I've played PLENTY in my time) can have 3 dimensional roaming battles, but with WEGS every rule and ability that is created generally focuses on the battle, which above all else makes the system really shine in combat. In AD&amp;D mods that I've done, when you're a couple months into a real power gaming scenario, the primary problem is that it takes a long time to calculate damage, and battles involving a lot of npcs and villains can get hairy to fathom. Try to mix miniatures into the scene and you're opening up a can of worms. Not so with WEGS! This game really incorporates everything that is necessary to have massively sized epic battles, flawlessly integrating the rules to make it happen smooth, quick, and fun. The last 4 sessions that we've had has been an army attacking a fortified village. Sure there is plenty of plot and story arcs that go along with it, but only with wegs can you really have the feel of taking on an entire army over the course of hours and hours of gameplay, involving hundreds upon hundreds of enemies, npcs. There's nothing like standing in a canyon, and standing against an unending barrage of enemies, with arrow fire covering your men from fortified positions in the turrets alongside of you. In any other system it would get bogged down, but with WEGS you can do it and have that frantic feel that you need to be able to keep suspense and action alive in a long drawn out battle.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, on the surface the game is a simple dungeon crawl with lots of activity and a high action atmosphere, but this is ONLY on the surface, of a system that has so much potential, and has only been partially revealed to the gamers. The cards that have people's initial abilities are used at the con, to make it more of a hands on experience (which goes hand in hand with all the poker chips. There's nothing quite like literally seeing how many wounds that enemy has, and being able to physically remove them when you do damage. Which also is cool, because in this game damage is always rounded up. 14 damage means 2 chips. It's a LOT easier than calculating numbers non stop. Just round up to the nearest chip and take them off the pile.) The cards kind of go out the window when you start leveling up those abilities. The system isn't something that stagnates once you go into depth or continue on for a long time, instead it is when things go on for a while that the beauty of the system really shines. My gaming group knows how to break games. We've done it before, and we'll do it again. We try to abuse the rules of a system to push it to its absolute limits, but the thing about WEGS is that it is completely intuitive when you get into the really high levels. Abilities can be raised in strength, and you can easily come up with unending ways to make more abilities more powerful and more interesting, to promote a campaign that has much deeper levels in it then at the very beginning. Every class and character begins at a certain equal level, but once you begin to customize the character by leveling it up, after just a few session you can really begin to see how much potential the system as. As I've said, we like to break games by hacking the hell out of them, and with WEGS the system doesn't have that many limits. A little ingenuity is all it took for our group to really expand the horizons of the system, and we've been doing all of this without ever having peered inside one of the books, or even in Larry's mind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_85452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/LordZoma" title="LordZoma"><img alt="LordZoma" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/LordZoma">LordZoma</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85452/#Comment_85452" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-03T18:37:10+00:00" title="August  3, 2007  6:37PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I know it seems like a direct promotion at the start, but what I'm doing here is building up a little bit of buzz, and sharing what one gamer thinks. I've been playing rpgs and card games for a couple decades now, and I've never ever seen a system that is so simple, and well balanced as this one. It has everything that anyone I know has ever wanted in a system that would involve miniatures. The tactile feel of it, the ease of battle, the potential for expansion, the intuitive way that it handles more power, everything about it makes me just want to scream from the rooftops about how this game is going to take the gaming world by storm. There are so many things that you can do with this system, to even replacing the characters themselves with vehicles and ships for space based combat using an rpg. I've never seen anything like it before, and I probably never will again. WEGS really does have it all when it comes to a game that lets you put away all the books and mess, and just straight up jump into the fray, and start expanding on the rules as you go along.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, everything utilizes 2d10 and 2d6. All of the abilities are based off of either spending your spoints, or making cold rolls for chances to succeed. The brilliance of this is that you're not pouring through your dice bag to find extra dice needed to do the task at hand, or pouring through a gigantic spell manual wondering if that level 4 spell just might be used in a particular way to get you out of that jam. If you want to run a game that just goes all over the place, stick to something like west end games d6 system, but if you want a game that lets you really really enjoy combat in a way that has never been done before, WEGS is the way to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know this is a long post, and it's kind of silly of me to be ranting and raving like a foaming madman about this game, but my friends and I are seriously addicted to it. It's ADDICTING! We're like the only group in the world other than Larry's die hard group that plays this game, because we couldn't wait for larry to release it to get started. We recreated the system entirely by memory, and just began to make things up as we went along, and this was MONTHS ago. We're still playing it, and going strong! The game is THAT good. YES it CAN be used for lon term campaigns, and trust me, once you get started, you won't want to put it down.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe main books come out at Gencon, and if you check out the wick site, you'll see their con list. If you're at any of those conventions, hit up the WEGS table, and take a look at what the future of combat gaming looks like. Hey, mention Greg sent you. Maybe you'll get a free spoint.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_85456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/LordZoma" title="LordZoma"><img alt="LordZoma" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/LordZoma">LordZoma</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85456/#Comment_85456" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-03T19:12:34+00:00" title="August  3, 2007  7:12PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Argh, I'm flipping out.
