Obviously Kagematsu was a great first step, but I'm looking for other ideas for gamers, generally, as well as this particular one, who might only really know about any kind of tabletop gaming because of board games or something similar.<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, feel free to toss out any favourites. I guess being a board game player doesn't really matter; it's just her particular starting point so I thought it might be interesting to use it as a basis.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, I should add I've had pretty good success with Mouse Guard when I've run it for complete RPG newbies but not sure how she'd like it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312692">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag" title="viktor_haag"><img alt="viktor_haag" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/591/nDZQG5TW1V86P.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag">viktor_haag</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312692/#Comment_312692" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-15T13:03:40+00:00" title="February 15, 2011  1:03PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You might have more success with this question if you also think along the lines of "what kinds of stories does this player like to read/view/play through"? A boardgamer who really likes 18xx train games is different to a boardgamer who really likes to play Arkham Horror (or can be).<br/><br/>What sorts of boardgames does this player really like to play and what sorts of books to read, movies to watch, comics to read, and so on?<br/><br/>For example, Fourth Edition D&amp;D has strong appeal to some kinds of boardgame types in its tactical encounter rules: it relies so heavily on phased activity, physical components, tactical choices.<br/><br/>By the same token, it seems to me that Vincent Baker's games might appeal strongly to some kinds of boardgame enthusiasts: they have an extremely focussed sense of theme that roots right down deep into the game mechanics, and the mechanics themselves direct player activity by providing a great deal of structure around activity choice. Apocalypse World, in particular, overtly casts "story choices" in strongly mechanistic terms ("moves"). In this way, there's a strong encouragement to treat the characters as game artifacts, and that can be seen as having a lot in common with boardgames.<br/><br/>But knowing what your player friend likes around story would help guide good choices for you to try.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312725">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafe" title="Rafe"><img alt="Rafe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/580/nVD52VTM5722R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafe">Rafe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312725/#Comment_312725" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-15T14:46:56+00:00" title="February 15, 2011  2:46PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 15, 2011 2:50PM by Rafe.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, good call.

I'll check that out when I get it with a mind to how this potential gamer might like it. Good suggestion!<br/>\n<br/>\nedit: Just realized that one of John Harper's games might work well, too.

It's boardgame-like in many of its requirements, and it seems like a good follow-up for Kagematsu, assuming the players don't particularly dislike zombie movies.<br/><br/>All of Graham's suggestions are solid as well. <i>Dread</i> requires a lot from the GM, of course, but if you have an experienced gamer for that role then it's no problem. Another game that always comes to my mind when considering Dread is <i>Dead of Night</i>, which shares many of the advantageous qualities from a beginner viewpoint.<br/><br/>Ah, one more black horse suggestion comes to mind if you have that experienced GM: <a href="http://isabout.wordpress.com/fables-of-camelot/" rel="nofollow">Fables of Camelot</a> is something that I developed with Sami Koponen this last summer for the exact purpose of introducing roleplaying to newbies in casual environments such as conventions or boardgame nights. It's very reliable for the purpose, mostly because it's built to be very easy and natural to GM, thus ensuring that the natural strenght of the roleplaying form gets through without personality-related hitches.<br/><br/>(I almost listed old-school D&amp;D here as an option as well, but then realized that it's only an excellent beginner game for hardcore environments: teenagers thirsting for fantasy vistas, willing to spend 4 hours with the game before it hits, in other words. While the Mentzer red box would hit harder than any of the above suggestions for that audience, the above suggestions are much better for adults and casual gamers.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_313316">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313316/#Comment_313316" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-19T00:38:11+00:00" title="February 19, 2011 12:38AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've found it to be more dependent on theme than anything else. D&amp;D used to be marketed along the lines of fantasy novels, so it appealed to people who liked that theme. My girlfriend likes Dragonlance (and Kender in particular), so DL5A was an immediate hit. AD&amp;D and H\xe2rnMaster, not so much, and that's despite her liking dice more than cards. The StarORE game I ran with our group of friends ended up being a flop since only 2 of us had watched Star Wars. The Final Fantasy themed one was quite successful because only one person had never played any FF games.<br/><br/>So, based on that, I'd say the easiest thing would be to find what novels she likes, and see what RPG you like fits in. If she's an Anne Rice fan, Vampire: The Masquerade might be a good fit. If she watches Morse and Midsommer Murders, maybe Trail of Cthulhu would be the way to go (I can't remember what other games use the Gumshoe system off hand). Same goes for movies and TV shows, and if you're the type to analyse lyrics, maybe music.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_313363">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafe" title="Rafe"><img alt="Rafe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/580/nVD52VTM5722R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafe">Rafe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313363/#Comment_313363" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-19T12:48:07+00:00" title="February 19, 2011 12:48PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the suggestion, guys!
