                    Yesterday a friend of mine was at <a href="http://www.kublacon.com/" rel="nofollow">KublaCon</a>, and he picked up a copy of a Japanese game at the dealers room, which turned out to be a Japanese game company's fanservicey entries into Flying Buffalo's <a href="http://www.flyingbuffalo.com/lostw.shtml" rel="nofollow">Lost Worlds</a> "fantasy combat books," called "<a href="http://www.hobbyjapan.co.jp/queen/" rel="nofollow">Queen's Blade</a>." Each book represents a character, and you actually trade books with your opponent so they get a "first person" view of your character. This in turn reminded me of <a href="http://www.cheapass.com/" rel="nofollow">Cheapass Games'</a> Button Men, where your playing piece is a button with numbers on it, that represents a character, not to mention Brawl, where each character is represented by a specific deck of cards.<br/><br/>I'm wondering if this approach -- with specific pre-made characters -- has been tried before with roleplaying games. People do pregens for cons and whatnot (and published Paranoia adventures usually have pregens included), but what about pre-made characters as a deliberate design choice? I can't help but think there's some game concept out there that would be served that way.                </div>

                            I used premade characters for the LARP I ran at the weekend.<br/>
<br/>
Premade characters are superb. You can set them up so they play off each other: one character has an interest in investigating cults; another is a member of a cult.<br/>
<br/>
In a sense, it's odd that many games let players create their own characters. You end up with a mish-mash of characters, with nothing in common.<br/>
<br/>
Using premade characters alleviates that. You can set up your party of characters so they've all got common backgrounds, they all know secrets about each other and they all have character quirks that will set off each other's quirks. <br/>
<br/>
On another note, wasn't "premade characters" one of the Game Chef ingredients from a couple of years back? I think 1984 Prime used them.<br/>

                            The use of pre-made characters is quite common in super-hero role-playing.  This is especially true if playing using an existing universe (Marvel, DC), where part of the fun is not just playing any super-hero, but playing your favourite super-hero.  If I remember correctly, the first edition of the Marvel Super-Heroes game had a very minimal system for designing your own characters.  That might classify as a "deliberate design choice".  Certainly many, if not most, of the published adventures for the Marvel and DC games were intended to be played with the stock characters.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I think that the Talislanta "archetypes" which seem to be the main path of character creation, provide enough detail that I think one could classify them as pre-gen characters.  But that is simply based on an off-hand glance through the rules at one point.<br/>
<br/>
In my experience, the problem with pregenerated characters is finding the balance between so much backstory detail that the player doesn't really feel like they are contributing anything, to so little backstory detail that you might as well just have let them come up with their own characters.  <br/>
<br/>
As a tie-in to Lost Worlds, Alfred Leonardi (the designer of those books), also did a series of equivalent books for Marvel super-heroes called Battle Books.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, one of the scantily clad Queen's Blade characters appears to be named Echidna...something got a bit mixed up in translation there, as the character bears no resemblance whatsoever to a small, furry, egg-laying mammal.  http://www.flyingbuffalo.com/echidna.htm                        </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/Hans">@Hans</a>:<br/><br/>If you mean the original <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Super_Heroes_(role-playing_game)" rel="nofollow">FASERIP Marvel game</a>, custom character creation was handled almost entirely by percentile rolls, making for very random and at times underpowered characters. I think I would've enjoyed it more with the premade Marvel characters, come to think of it. OTOH I'm having a kickass time with original characters in my group's Truth &amp; Justice campaign.<br/><br/>The level of character background is an important thing to consider. Superheroes are iconic and familiar, and licensed games can often rely on the fans' familiarity with the property in that respect, and Jonathan Walton's Kyoko and Kublai Khan are like mythic archetypes. The characters for Brawl have distinctive designs, but generally no written history whatsoever, Button Men vary a bit depending on who's doing them (ranging from "Bunny" to "Sailor Moon"), and the Queen's Blade characters have roughly two paragraphs of bio, but no more than that. For these games it's mostly just flavor text, but for RPGs that kind of thing can actually matter a lot. Hmm...<br/><br/>Gotta love the Engrish. According to the <a href="http://www.hobbyjapan.co.jp/queen/character/index5.html" rel="nofollow">Japanese website</a> Echidna is a wild elf and forest guardian; Engrish usually has its own zany internal logic (hence "Donkey Kong").<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/JonathanWalton">@JonathanWalton</a>:<br/>Is there anything in particular about it that appeals to you? What kinds of characters have you tried, and what has worked especially well?                        </div>

                            You're being funny, right? Just ignoring that said monotreme was named, in fact, for the Greek "mother of monsters"? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echidna_(mythology)<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I refer to this concept from the prototype that I had for it when we first discussed it at The Forge as the "Scooby-Do RPG" where your character choices were Fred, Thelma, Daphne, Shaggy or Scooby. As mentioned there have been several attempts at this in Iron Game Chef and elsewhere. That is, "pure" versions of this where there are only X number of preset characters to choose from. My supposition was that these games might also be, in some cases (though not the Scooby-Do game), one-shots. Seems like an odd RPG product, but consider the "Throw Your Own Murder Mystery" style products which are, in fact, precisely just this sort of thing, and seem to sell well enough. <br/>

                            Two friends of mine have started an RP company called Shifting Forest Storyworks and they specialise in Parlor Larps: larps designed to be run at the drop of a hat, in one room, with no (or extremely little) prep.  Sortof like the How to Host a Murder games.  The catch is that all their pre-gen character sheets also have questions on the back, allowing for personalisation of the character; the answers don't change the motives, just why they want them.  And there's no pre-set ending.  And it works really really well.  The questions help the players get an idea of what their character is like as well as helping them get into the game-world mindset.  I think it sits nicely in the gap between pre-gen and personalised characters.<br/>

                            Ewen, I guess the classic example is that no one says, "I wanna play other minor characters in the <i>Star Wars</i> universe that don't really influence the overall plotline at all!"  Instead, they say, "I wanna be Han Solo!"  I'm not sure what to say about "what kinds of characters have worked well," but I think you want ones that are iconic enough to be easily understood, but open enough that players can put their own spin on things.<br/><br/>Mike, I think your "one-shot" intuition is just based on common practices of only using pre-created characters at limited convention games.  But there's no reason creating your own characters should be the norm.  Why should player-created characters last longer than pre-generated ones?  Because players have more invested in them?  I don't think that's necessarily true.                        </div>

I've been looking at those games for a while, trying to decide if I want to get a few.  If your friends had some kind of promotional download that shows what their stuff work like, there's a whole stack of possible customers out in my neighborhood.                        </div>

                            Let's not forget that one of the most popular RPG campaigns ever was built around premade characters - Dragonlance.<br/><br/>And DL suffered if you didn't use those now-iconic characters. I know that, because I allowed my players to come up with their own Innfellows. I still envy all those DL DMs that compared their campaigns in our store. <br/>"Wasn't it cool when Tanis discovered that ... SPOILER" or "Your Raistlin did <i>what</i>?"<br/><br/>Or those chance meetings of two players who were talking like actors about their portrayals of Caramon.<br/>Our own non-standard DL campiagn was fun, nonetheless, but I feel as if I robbed my players of that metagame fun.                        </div>

That's pretty cool, and almost the reverse of the Shab al-Hiri Roach (in terms of what the players did AS Raistlin, and not what horrible things they did TO Raistlin).  But that's another cool factor that might lead one to set up pregen characters.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

<p>I managed to run the first <em>encounter</em> in the Dragonlance series before everyone bailed. In hindsight, this player sense of self-preservation was probably a good thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, the "pregen" NPCs in Roach can be pretty entertaining when you compare notes.</p>

                            Yes, The Roach doesn't really fit the initial query, but it might be an interesting analog, since it has mandatory, pre-defined NPCs that you get to abuse.  I didn't realize it at the time, but the weird continuity between disparate sessions is a real draw:<br/><br/><i>"What did you guys do to Regina Sutton?  We turned her into a combination Sumerian high preistess/suicide bomber."</i> </div>
