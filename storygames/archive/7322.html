Massively entangled plot, awesome characterization, lots of players on the Owe list.  This game continues to amaze me. <br/><br/>The big thing I learned from this: When you play with a lot of people, concurrent scenes are inevitable and they'll start being played separately.  When this happens jump up and ask players to move chairs, bring players who are in the same scene together.  Then players can move between concurrent scenes by moving where they're sitting.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
