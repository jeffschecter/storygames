Not that I dislike d20, but I like a lot of games and diffderent styles.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to do something different than the two other d20 games and then a thought hit me: start them at level 10, and keep them there so I wouldn't have to worry about the headaches of high level play that had derailed my last two games. Once I came to that conclusion, a more political game, set in a fantasy version of the real-world, began to take shjape.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I've wikified the original notes. We had a character generation session and then I set up the first game as follows<br/>\n<br/>\n"You're on a mountainside in south-central France. Looming several hundred yeards away, a hundred feet above yiur head, is a large cave that's been burrowed in the mountainside. The air reeks of brimstone. An acrid yellow smoke wafts out of the cave, produced by the red dragon that the king has sent you to kill."<br/>\n<br/>\nThis description received the appropriate response. A great way to kick a campaign.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe wiki is here:<br/>\nhttp://1166.wikidot.com/1166-campaign-home-page<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease comment or make suggestions if they strike you.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

You might want to have a look at Ryan Stoughton's E6 take on d20. It was designed to scratch the same itch, i.e., the D&amp;D sweet spot at levels 6-10.<br/><br/>But I'm sure Ryan will be along shortly. That d20 thread tag is like chum to his shark-nose.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson" title="C.W.Richeson"><img alt="C.W.Richeson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/55624463/10865474"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson">C.W.Richeson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127825/#Comment_127825" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T17:45:40+00:00" title="February 19, 2008  5:45PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow!

Justin's shark analogy is fair, but I don't have a lot to say unless you really want to get into the nitty gritty of how the level choice is going to shape what the players do.  <br/><br/>How many sessions are you planning to run while keeping characters at level 10?

I want them to initiate schemes of advancement, which I'll judge on a case by case basis.<br/>\n<br/>\nEveryday equipment -- if it's common, you have it, I won't sweat logistics on that level. If it's rare, you need to use Diplomacy, Influence (or brute force) to get it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
