As I suspect I would feel with /all/ Vincent Baker games, I want to try it, and thoroughly try it, to see how it works.<br/><br/>Burning Wheel: We played it for a year. Parts of it worked, parts of it did not. Then we threw our hands up. I would definitely like to try it again, and this time I would (a) use Burning Wheel Gold with all of its reputed improvements, and (b) try to ease into it in exactly the way advised in the Adventure Burner.<br/><br/>Capes: We tried this for a couple sessions and it seemed pretty fun. We all seemed to think that maybe it wasn't all that well suited to longer term play, but I'm not sure we played enough to fairly have that determination. I wouldn't mind trying it again for a stretch of four or five sessions to see what happens over a longer term.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335505/#Comment_335505" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-21T10:28:39+00:00" title="July 21, 2011 10:28AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Freemarket: One session with two groups, but I can't figure out where the fun is.

I'm itching to hack the hell out of it.<br/><br/>InSpectres: Ran it once or twice. Feels like it could use more attention.<br/><br/>PTA: Played it, never ran it.
