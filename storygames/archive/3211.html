Concurrently, I've also recently finished <i>The Life &amp; Times of Scrooge McDuck</i>, a graphic novel by Dan Rosa chronicling the rise of the richest duck in the world. Amusingly, the latter has helped me better understand the former, especially how Traits are best used in the game.<br/><br/>As I first came to the system, I looked at Traits as functiong something like Attributes do in traditional tactical rpg's. That is, if the Trait rating is higher, the stat is more powerful. So, the character with a strength-like Trait rated at 3 is weaker than another whose comparable physical Trait is rated 5.<br/><br/>Which is completely wrong. Rather, its a scale of relevance, showing how often the Trait will have natrrative value, not "how hard it hits".<br/><br/>Which is where old Scrooge comes in. He's the richest Duck in the world, which if he were a character in any traditional game system would mean he'd have most of his character-build resources invested in his wealth. But in the stories (and thus according to a dramatic approach), that's not how Scrooge makes things happen. Rather he's "Tougher than the toughies and smarter than the smarties".  Thus by Wushu terms, that should be his primary Trait, with the highest rating. His wealth usually only comes up as a staging convention to begin the tales, setting up a mine he owns in Africa or a ship from his fleet lost in the Bermuda Triangle. Being Tougher/Smarter is more dramatically important, on a story by story basis, than his wealth. Even if he does own three cubic acres of money. He simply does not solve problems by throwing cash at them (now, if I were statting up Richie Rich, things'd be different).<br/><br/>Extending this thinking, relative values do not matter at all when statting characters in Wushu. If one character has "Mountain-Hurling Strength", a second "Respectable Right Hook Punch", yet the first is rated at 3 and the second at 4, than throwing a good solid punch will just matter more ofetn than shot-putting Mt. Washington in any situation the two come up. I rather like this, since it takes the emphasis off of raw power, and lets me design characters entirely on interest.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_73179">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SabreCat" title="SabreCat"><img alt="SabreCat" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://cheri.shyou.org/~sabrecat/images/msuttner-storygames_tani.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SabreCat">SabreCat</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73179/#Comment_73179" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-01T11:36:33+00:00" title="June  1, 2007 11:36AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's great, isn't it?

To go even further, if I'd stat Scrooge I'd even think about using his Wealth as his weakness. It defenitly does get him into trouble more often then not and in many stories, he has a hard time getting his wealth back on his own and so needs his family. (ie. the Other PCs.)<br/><br/>This thread must be added to the Wall of Wushu btw. ^_^                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_73237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73237/#Comment_73237" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-01T13:55:00+00:00" title="June  1, 2007  1:55PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm.
