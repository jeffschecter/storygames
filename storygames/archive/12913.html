I gave a copy of Play Unsafe to Ken Hite, once, and that's about it. <br/><br/>But this hasn't stopped my stuff getting reviewed. Both Play Unsafe and A Taste For Murder have very positive reviews on RPG.NET. My Cthulhu scenarios get reviewed in other places.<br/><br/>Also, some conversations with podcasters have put me off sending review copies. I've heard things like "People send us lots of stuff to review", which makes me think, well, I won't add to that pile. <br/><br/>What about you? Do you send review copies? If so, has it worked for you?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_290805">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290805/#Comment_290805" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-01T08:24:31+00:00" title="September  1, 2010  8:24AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As I described in the other thread, I don't send review copies. Thinking about this, a part of it is probably a dislike for the status games involved: I always feel like I should be deciding who's a real journalist and who's just a hack if I got into that game.<br/><br/>My impression is that not giving out review copies has had some impact on the amount of review, but that it depends on the product. Zombie Cinema has had a fair amount of reviews and a huge amount of actual play reporting under this policy, while Solar System and World of Near have been all but ignored in this regard - neither has been reviewed anywhere as far as I know. This is most likely the sort of thing that depends on the nature of the product; I have a feeling that WoN would probably have benefited a great deal from artificial publicity, while ZC has found its audience without help. They are very different games all around, so one can make many guesses as to the crucial difference; perhaps it's that one is a light game while the other requires plenty of commitment, or that one is very focused while the other is more generic... difficult to say.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_290812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290812/#Comment_290812" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-01T08:32:57+00:00" title="September  1, 2010  8:32AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We sent out a small number of review copies based on some requests and on some people that we knew would want to review.

I mean, he reviews stuff, and that's why I gave him a copy of my first game years ago. But now I give him copies because I think he's cool and I like talking to him about games. It's nice if he reviews them, but that's not something I specifically think about now. It's just "Oh hey, it's Ken! Let me give you my game!"<br/><br/>I've sent out a couple PDFs at the request of some people who wanted to review the game. None of those have turned into reviews yet. Blowback also got a very even-handed, decent review at RPGnet today by BlackHat Matt, who purchased the game.<br/><br/>I also just sent a copy of Blowback to one of the few people I go all fangirl over, because I heard he was pretty interested in my game. If he decides to review it, I'm sure that will lead to fame and glory for me, but mostly I'm just geeking out over the idea that someone I admire so much is going to have something with my byline on it.<br/><br/>Mostly though, any free PDFs I've sent out have been in the context of a larger conversation, for literal <i>review</i>\u2014 to be looked over and dissected and inform a greater dialogue, usually over email or maybe in a blog. And that's worth it every single time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_290853">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290853/#Comment_290853" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-01T09:36:21+00:00" title="September  1, 2010  9:36AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I get a bunch of stuff through my podcasting through Pulp Gamer, though I don't consider what we do on Out of Character to be "reviews" in the sense that I say "this worked, this didn't, this is what I think".  Normally on Out of Character I feel my job is to find the game a home.  In other words, I don't say "HERO is the most godawful system for adapting PS238 in the history of mankind" (though it clearly is), I instead say "PS238 uses the HERO system, and there's a big community for that and a LOT of superhero stuff that you can plunder for ideas, and it's clear that the author loves both the system and the source material".  That helps PS238 find a home with someone who will like it, and emphasize its strong points.  It's not a review, in the sense that I do a lot of critical thinking about it and pick it apart.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_290857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290857/#Comment_290857" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-01T09:43:01+00:00" title="September  1, 2010  9:43AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason, does the incoming swag influence what you choose to talk about?

I mean, I talk about my enthusiasms 90 percent of the time, but if someone sends me something that's outside my experience range, that's probably the only way that I'm going to know anything about it.  In other words, if I'm not already talking about it, it's probably because I don't know anything about it and sending me a copy is the only way I'm going to learn about it in a reliable enough way to talk about. (I don't talk about forum-buzz or rpg.net darlings or whatever, only about things that I know about.)  <br/><br/>Agh, that paragraph is a muddle, someone shoot it.  The answer is YES, it influences what I talk about, especially for things that I wouldn't normally know to talk about.

I've received some review copies, one I got a turnaround for very quickly, although I had some difficulty being balanced as it wasn't my thing, and I usually research books heavily before getting them so most of the time I'm reviewing something I like. Another it took me about a year to finish, a real life catastrophe got in the way, but I did finally put it out, and Fred Hicks was very gracious about the delay. I'm currently sitting on one because I really want to play it to do the review justice, rather than putting out just a capsule review, but it's damn hard getting people together to play it, so I'm settling with a 1 player 1 GM game in the near future to get it out without too much more delay. I find with a review copy there's some more obligation to be thorough, which makes it harder to put out quickly, and there's also the fact that if you don't like it you can't just ditch it and not review (if I buy a game that's crap, I usually don't feel like reading it all the way through to put the review out, as that doesn't benefit me in any way).<br/><br/>Given that, it's worth considering if someone is just going to put out a review of the book without a playtest, or if they are going to do a playtest, if they've got an existing group that's game to try out new things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_290928">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray" title="Tim_Gray"><img alt="Tim_Gray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray">Tim_Gray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290928/#Comment_290928" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-01T13:53:33+00:00" title="September  1, 2010  1:53PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a big generalisation, if I send people stuff to review nothing happens, but if people ask for stuff to review there's usually a good outcome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_292020">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292020/#Comment_292020" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-07T11:59:49+00:00" title="September  7, 2010 11:59AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I intend to send a copy of The Rustbelt to RPGPundit, because his reviews crack me up.
