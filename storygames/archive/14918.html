Certainly it will be on Saturday October 1.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will be running Adventurer Conqueror King, Michael Curtis will be running Stonehell (or something else as he pleases), and I hope others will volunteer to run stuff as well. All games which proceed from Arneson's legacy - which is to say all roleplaying games and lots of miniatures games too - are welcome.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
