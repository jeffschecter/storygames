The more damage you take, the smaller your hand gets. I mean that's also equally visceral and mechanical, since the cards in your hand represent what you have to work with at any moment, so it's not just a superficial way of representing something.<br/><br/>I was toying with the idea a while back of a "paper doll" based character sheet, where you would physically slot in your equipment and abilities and what not, with everything you needed to know about using them included right there. It was in part inspired by the satirical dungeon crawling game Meikyuu Kingdom, where all of the games fungible objects (skills, items, equipment, monsters, traps, etc) are all stat-blocked out on little (illustrated!) cards that you can photocopy and cut out, and whose character sheets dedicate about half of their space to an overview of the game's turn structure and how to resolve different actions you can take, repeating rules for status effects, and things like that.<br/><br/>I'd probably only call it a half measure as far as how radical one could get with the idea, but "breaking the rules out of the book" I think helps a lot with, if not immersion specifically, the problem of it taking too long to look things up. That's sort of the idea of a GM's screen, but extrapolated out to all of the players, I guess. Please stop me if I'm going in the wrong direction with this though!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452223">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452223/#Comment_452223" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-15T18:18:53+00:00" title="April 15, 2016  6:18PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OMG someone else played the card-based SAGA.

I still wonder why this is the default medium, and once you go past 300 pages the book becomes as much a focus of the game as anything else. Sadly gamers are very attached to their artifacts.<br/><br/>We can address 3 by <b>using fewer words</b>. Seriously, most RPGs are full of filler when all you really need are a few clear examples, impressions, and bullet points. This is one thing the OSR and Apocalypse Worlds do really well, and the creative density tends to be much higher in those games. We can also replace words with symbols whenever possible to avoid engaging those higher brain functions which are a distraction here.<br/><br/>We can address 4 by having <b>a few clear rules</b>. If a rule is clear you don't need to wonder where it applies, and the fewer there are, the easier it will be to adapt them all on an intuitive level.<br/><br/>We can address 5 by having <b>rules with predefined stakes</b>. The rules to D&amp;D and Apocalypse World more clearly define what's at stake before a roll is made, while Fate and the new 7th Sea require much more negotiation at the table.<br/><br/>We can address 6 by <b>less distracting language</b>. Vincent Baker once said something to the effect that he knew he'd gotten Dogs in the Vineyard right when one of his players reflexively reached for the dice before a conflict. Now dice in DitV are allocated in a way similar enough to Fate Points, but didn't feel as 'distant' here because they weren't called out by name. Same happens if you just slide a FP over within the flow of the narrative as opposed to explicitly asking "I'll give you a fate point if..."<br/><br/>And while we're at it we can also <b>ask fewer questions</b>. Nothing is quite as disruptive as asking a player to consider things they weren't already doing so in the moment. Questions also reveal the man behind the curtain and force a player to engage the GM as opposed to using their character to engage the situation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452244/#Comment_452244" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-17T07:17:35+00:00" title="April 17, 2016  7:17AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Instead of cards, you could all have your phones on the table and hit the right button on the game app when you're trying to do something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452247">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452247/#Comment_452247" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-17T16:42:40+00:00" title="April 17, 2016  4:42PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 17, 2016 4:43PM by WarriorMonk.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>We can address 1 &amp; 2 by <b>not having books</b>. I still wonder why this is the default medium, and once you go past 300 pages the book becomes as much a focus of the game as anything else. Sadly gamers are very attached to their artifacts.<br/></blockquote>\nI'd still keep books to explain how the game works, since books are still unbeatable at that. You need something portable you can pass on to other players once you got the hang of it, you need to keep that material in order to help players understand the whole deal little by little. But, as reference sources for quick use during the game, books definitely won't do. Looking up for something in a book disrupts the conversation, breakes the GM-players connection, creates a void that players fill with distractive conversations and a large etc. <br/><br/>As a GM you can delegate book searching to another player with better memory than you, which makes the disruption less important. GM screens that facilitate quick access to reference information also help a great deal, as well as apps and the use of formats with quicker searching functions than your memory, a book index and quick page flipping. Cards help a lot when you want to piece up the information to give it for players to use, and as a object it can be turned over, rotated hide and put on sight to accomplish or signal different things.\n<blockquote><br/>We can address 3 by <b>using fewer words</b>. Seriously, most RPGs are full of filler when all you really need are a few clear examples, impressions, and bullet points. This is one thing the OSR and Apocalypse Worlds do really well, and the creative density tends to be much higher in those games. We can also replace words with symbols whenever possible to avoid engaging those higher brain functions which are a distraction here.<br/><br/>We can address 4 by having <b>a few clear rules</b>. If a rule is clear you don't need to wonder where it applies, and the fewer there are, the easier it will be to adapt them all on an intuitive level.<br/></blockquote>\nTotally agree. Seeing examples like Tenra Bansho and Delve as well as using them myself, I'd recommend using comics to explain how the game works. APs help a ton, but even then there are lots of gestual signals missing from APs, that convey even more things and that totally change the game experience. One example: reading an AP doesn't give you a real clue of how fast the conversation progresses. Whenever I see most videos of people playing RPGs I'm always surprised at how slow they are. While comics aren't still a perfect method for giving readers an exact measure of time, they definitely have more resources at giving hints about this.\n<blockquote><br/>We can address 5 by having <b>rules with predefined stakes</b>. The rules to D&amp;D and Apocalypse World more clearly define what's at stake before a roll is made, while Fate and the new 7th Sea require much more negotiation at the table.<br/></blockquote>\nWhile I had a relative sucess at GMing with the less amount of negotiation via <i>GM fiat of the obvious</i> I've been recently trying to design a game where players can decide some of those stakes on their own and reduced those stakes to a small list of keywords. It was meant to give players a tactical decision game element: adding a positive condition to an action increased the difficulty, but then adding a stake implied by a single word could reduce it again. In testing it made the game go slower at that point, and I'm not so sure yet if players enjoyed such options; so I'm wondering if I shouldn't be back at leaving the stakes up to GM fiat, since it seems quicker that way.<br/><br/>Also, I'm not too keen on <i>all</i> predefined stakes, lot of times both as a player and as a GM I like some surprises. I mean, I do like to know that my healing spell will consistently heal my companions, even if theres a small chance (that I'm aware of) that it may siphon my own HP. But for things like a special sword technique working the same way always, disregarding the opponents special defense conditions I'd prefer to see that stakes defined on the moment by the GM. Well, perhaps is just my perception.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
