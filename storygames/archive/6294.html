I don't get to playtest it very much, so at this rate, I'm looking at about another year before it's ready for whatever it's ready for.<br/><br/>For the next game, I'm thinking of changing a major rule. The rule deals with Steel Dice, which are a player resource (dice) that are rolled to make the game move to the next step. Successful rolls on a Steel Die move the Threat Level (a game item that tracks at what point in the mission the characters are) one point forward. When the players hit Threat Level seven, they win. The current rule goes like this:<br/><br/>1. Hey, you have this challenge to deal with. What skill will you use?<br/>2. Roll both a d6 against the skill score and your Steel Die.<br/>3. Equal or less than on the skill score and your skill succeeds.<br/>4. Steel Results possible: <br/>---If skill roll is a success, and Steel Die a success, you advance the threat level.<br/>---If skill roll is a success, and Steel Die a failure, you loose the Steel Die.<br/>---If skill roll is a failure, and Steel Die a success, you go nowhere.<br/>---If skill roll is a failure, and Steel Die a failure, you loose the Steel Die.<br/><br/>To gain Steel Dice, the characters must fight the bad guys.<br/><br/>I'm thinking of changing the rule to something like this:<br/><br/>1. Hey, you have this challenge to deal with. What skill will you use?<br/>2. Roll both a d6 against the skill score and your Steel Die.<br/>3. Equal or less than on the skill score and your skill succeeds.<br/>4. Steel results possible:<br/>---If the Steel Die a success, you advance the threat level.<br/>---If the Steel Die a failure,  you lose the Steel Die.<br/><br/>I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around how this will change play. The two ways that I can see are: 1. Threat Levels will advance sometimes even when a skill roll fails. I'm fine with that. 2. The game should go faster, because every success on a steel die translate to the threat level advancing.<br/><br/>Am I missing anything? What is this type of change telling the players?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray" title="Tim_Gray"><img alt="Tim_Gray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray">Tim_Gray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139515/#Comment_139515" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-13T12:35:49+00:00" title="April 13, 2008 12:35PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You might want to tweak your acronym to avoid confusion with P<span style="text-decoration: underline;">D</span>Q.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_139521">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139521/#Comment_139521" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-13T13:26:31+00:00" title="April 13, 2008  1:26PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's hard to answer the question without knowing more about the rest of the game, but I'd have thought that your current system is saying that plot advancement is all about success, with failure there cannot be progress. The new system is saying that the plot is always advancing, and both success and failure in tasks can be meaningful, and useful.<br/><br/>You'll also be saying that you can win while consistently failing, which may be less good                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139533">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bryan" title="Bryan"><img alt="Bryan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bryan">Bryan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139533/#Comment_139533" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-13T16:21:51+00:00" title="April 13, 2008  4:21PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            PDQ: Confusion with the National Cancer Institute would be bad, but Pinnacle Empty Quiver is PEQ.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Hituro">@Hituro</a>: That's exactly the kind of analysis I was looking for and hoping to get. Thanks! I hadn't thought of either of those two. The first draft of the game can be found at <a href="http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/Pinnacle_Empty_Quiver.php" rel="nofollow">1km1kt</a>. It's changed a ton, but I don't have the current version anywhere online. I can always post it if needed.<br/><br/>The second point has me a bit worried. The game is about Special Ops Forces, so I suppose that winning depends a bit on success. I'd have to add a narration tweak.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_139550">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139550/#Comment_139550" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-14T00:30:50+00:00" title="April 14, 2008 12:30AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well what does it mean to succeed at the story, while failing at the tasks that go towards completing it? If the answer is that things still come out the way the mission was intended, but in a way that is unhappy for the characters, then that can still work.<br/><br/>However reading your draft you say that spending steel is an attempt to make an action *count* towards plot resolution, without spending steel you can take actions, but they won't get you to the goal and the game can end without getting there. For this reason having steel not tied to success seems like it would break the game, because I would just go rogue on minute 1, then spend steel constantly to get to TL7, without any care for what actually happened in the fiction along the way, then I have hours to come to a solution. Doing that would miss most of the timed events, but I think I'd still have enough steel to get to 7.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bryan" title="Bryan"><img alt="Bryan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bryan">Bryan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139679/#Comment_139679" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-14T21:57:53+00:00" title="April 14, 2008  9:57PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The current version is a bit different than the draft. But I think you're right about untying steel from action. The game has never been about what is happy or unhappy for the characters -- it's manly about shoot 'em up action with very little role-playing involved. More an adventure game.<br/><br/>The constant complaint has been that it sucks loosing a steel point when the action fails, because there was no way the steel point would have counted anyway. The response since the first playtest has been war is tough -- deal with it. I think I'll try this:<br/><br/>1. Hey, you have this challenge to deal with. What skill will you use?<br/>2. Roll both a d6 against the skill score.<br/>3. Equal or less than on the skill score and your skill succeeds and <strong>you get to throw a Steel Die</strong>.<br/>4. Steel results possible:<br/>---If the Steel Die a success, you advance the threat level.<br/>---If the Steel Die a failure, you lose the Steel Die.<br/><br/>Thanks for helping me think this over.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
